Despite advances in vision and language models, this task remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model, allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh. Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing approaches.

| **[Composition and Alignment of Diffusion Models using Constrained Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19104v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/shervinkhalafi/constrained_comp_align.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/shervinkhalafi/constrained_comp_align) |
| **[ForgetMe: Evaluating Selective Forgetting in Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12574v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning. Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing privacy-preserving generative AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Quantum-Circuit-Based Visual Fractal Image Generation in Qiskit and Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18835v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit, highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various ecosystems with a customised approach, such as producing an exciting landscape based on a quantum art theme.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DreamVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model Dreamed with Comprehensive World Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04447v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[One Framework to Rule Them All: Unifying Multimodal Tasks with LLM Neural-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03001v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale models have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including automated medical services and intelligent customer support. However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we demonstrate the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a streamlined and efficient manner. All models, code, and datasets will be released publicly upon publication, fostering further research and innovation in this field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Visual-CoG: Stage-Aware Reinforcement Learning with Chain of Guidance for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18032v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities. However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance (Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%, 5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Diffusion-Based Data Augmentation for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17844v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases like small polyps and flat lesions critical for early detection in screening applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVAMD Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[CEIDM: A Controlled Entity and Interaction Diffusion Model for Enhanced Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17760v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their interaction control.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Instant Preference Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17718v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.</p></details> | 17 figures | None |
| **[Conditional Stochastic Interpolation for Generative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05579v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a conditional stochastic interpolation (CSI) method for learning conditional distributions. CSI is based on estimating probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations that transport a reference distribution to the target conditional distribution. This is achieved by first learning the conditional drift and score functions based on CSI, which are then used to construct a deterministic process governed by an ordinary differential equation or a diffusion process for conditional sampling. In our proposed approach, we incorporate an adaptive diffusion term to address the instability issues arising in the diffusion process. We derive explicit expressions of the conditional drift and score functions in terms of conditional expectations, which naturally lead to an nonparametric regression approach to estimating these functions. Furthermore, we establish nonasymptotic error bounds for learning the target conditional distribution. We illustrate the application of CSI on image generation using a benchmark image dataset.</p></details> | 60 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Pixel Perfect MegaMed: A Megapixel-Scale Vision-Language Foundation Model for Generating High Resolution Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12698v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image synthesis presents unique challenges due to the inherent complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts. Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification, showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation, particularly in low-data regimes.

| **[Imperceptible Protection against Style Imitation from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19254v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in diffusion models has profoundly enhanced the fidelity of image generation, but it has raised concerns about copyright infringements. While prior methods have introduced adversarial perturbations to prevent style imitation, most are accompanied by the degradation of artworks' visual quality. Recognizing the importance of maintaining this, we introduce a visually improved protection method while preserving its protection capability. To this end, we devise a perceptual map to highlight areas sensitive to human eyes, guided by instance-aware refinement, which refines the protection intensity accordingly. We also introduce a difficulty-aware protection by predicting how difficult the artwork is to protect and dynamically adjusting the intensity based on this. Lastly, we integrate a perceptual constraints bank to further improve the imperceptibility. Results show that our method substantially elevates the quality of the protected image without compromising on protection efficacy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[JCo-MVTON: Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free Virtual Try-on](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17614v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off'' model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.</p></details> |  | None |

It is not species specific and has been applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or "hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images, producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query image in just a few seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Original matlab code: https://github.com/Erotemic/hotspotter-matlab-2013, Python port: https://github.com/Erotemic/hotspotter</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Erotemic/hotspotter-matlab-2013) |

| **[Bias Amplification in Stable Diffusion's Representation of Stigma Through Skin Tones and Their Homogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17465v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generators (T2Is) are liable to produce images that perpetuate social stereotypes, especially in regards to race or skin tone. We use a comprehensive set of 93 stigmatized identities to determine that three versions of Stable Diffusion (v1.5, v2.1, and XL) systematically associate stigmatized identities with certain skin tones in generated images. We find that SD XL produces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which indicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and perpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized identities. SD XL also shows approximately 30% less variability in skin tones when compared to previous models and 18.89-56.06% compared to human face datasets. Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to human perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount of variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts most (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized identities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and ethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities, reinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and socially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest and most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other models examined in this study, these findings have implications for the dynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and challenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized identities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 2024 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society; code available at https://github.com/kyrawilson/Image-Generation-Bias</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/kyrawilson/Image-Generation-Bias) |
| **[Condition Weaving Meets Expert Modulation: Towards Universal and Controllable Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17364v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition, leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation (UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and effectiveness.

| **[DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17356v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GigaTok: Scaling Visual Tokenizers to 3 Billion Parameters for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08736v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autoregressive (AR) image generation, visual tokenizers compress images into compact discrete latent tokens, enabling efficient training of downstream autoregressive models for visual generation via next-token prediction. While scaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often degrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed in existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first approach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and representation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing complexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs. generation dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which aligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a pre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space complexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both reconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic regularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using 1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when expanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize training for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to $\bf{3 \space billion}$ parameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction, downstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

While post-training alignment has proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation, its application to generative speech restoration remains largely under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency, and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models (MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce scenarios like singing voice restoration.

Because no existing datasets are available for this task, we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which consider captions and images separately. We release our code at: https://github.com/HyeyeeonKim/MMCIG</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/HyeyeeonKim/MMCIG) |
| **[Adversarial Illusions in Multi-Modal Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11804v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal embeddings encode texts, images, thermal images, sounds, and videos into a single embedding space, aligning representations across different modalities (e.g., associate an image of a dog with a barking sound). In this paper, we show that multi-modal embeddings can be vulnerable to an attack we call "adversarial illusions." Given an image or a sound, an adversary can perturb it to make its embedding close to an arbitrary, adversary-chosen input in another modality. These attacks are cross-modal and targeted: the adversary can align any image or sound with any target of his choice. Adversarial illusions exploit proximity in the embedding space and are thus agnostic to downstream tasks and modalities, enabling a wholesale compromise of current and future tasks, as well as modalities not available to the adversary. Using ImageBind and AudioCLIP embeddings, we demonstrate how adversarially aligned inputs, generated without knowledge of specific downstream tasks, mislead image generation, text generation, zero-shot classification, and audio retrieval. We investigate transferability of illusions across different embeddings and develop a black-box version of our method that we use to demonstrate the first adversarial alignment attack on Amazon's commercial, proprietary Titan embedding. Finally, we analyze countermeasures and evasion attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In US...</summary><p>In USENIX Security'24</p></details> | None |

Our approach leverages textual inversion and diffusion-based guided image generation to augment small style datasets. By systematically generating diverse style samples guided by both the original style images and real face images, we significantly enhance the diversity of the style dataset. Using this augmented dataset, we train fast image-to-image translation networks that outperform diffusion-based methods in speed and quality. Experiments on multiple styles demonstrate that our method improves stylization quality, better preserves source image content, and significantly accelerates inference. Additionally, we provide a systematic evaluation of the augmentation techniques and their impact on stylization performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Watermarking Visual Concepts for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11688v3)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The personalization techniques of diffusion models succeed in generating images with specific concepts. This ability also poses great threats to copyright protection and network security since malicious users can generate unauthorized content and disinformation relevant to a target concept. Model watermarking is an effective solution to trace the malicious generated images and safeguard their copyright. However, existing model watermarking techniques merely achieve image-level tracing without concept traceability. When tracing infringing or harmful concepts, current approaches execute image concept detection and model tracing sequentially, where performance is critically constrained by concept detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight concept watermarking framework that efficiently binds target concepts to model watermarks, supporting simultaneous concept identification and model tracing via single-stage watermark verification. To further enhance the robustness of concept watermarking, we propose an adversarial perturbation injection method collaboratively embedded with watermarks during image generation, avoiding watermark removal by model purification attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptWM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art watermarking methods, improving detection accuracy by 6.3%-19.3% across diverse datasets including COCO and StableDiffusionDB. Additionally, ConceptWM possesses a critical capability absent in other watermarking methods: it sustains a 21.7% FID/CLIP degradation under adversarial fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion models on WikiArt and CelebA-HQ, demonstrating its capability to mitigate model misuse.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advances in image generation have enabled high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations, we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose, expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead. Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion, while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages(excluding references), 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc, human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation, respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find better hyperparameters.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features: (1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive generative adversarial network (MSPG-SEN) for GAN models. This paper has four contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN has achieved state-of-the-art generation results on the following five datasets,INKK The dataset is 89.7\%,AWUN The dataset is 78.3\%,IONJ The dataset is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow dynamic residual network(). After ablation experiments, it can effectively improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability, with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK With strong cross-task capability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CineScale: Free Lunch in High-Resolution Cinematic Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15774v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning, and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

However, they remain underutilized in medical imaging, a field crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. This is primarily due to the high computational cost associated with (1) the use of large number of time steps (e.g., 1,000) in diffusion processes and (2) the increased dimensionality of medical images, which are often 3D or 4D. Training a diffusion model on medical images typically takes days to weeks, while sampling each image volume takes minutes to hours. To address this challenge, we introduce Fast-DDPM, a simple yet effective approach capable of improving training speed, sampling speed, and generation quality simultaneously. Unlike DDPM, which trains the image denoiser across 1,000 time steps, Fast-DDPM trains and samples using only 10 time steps. The key to our method lies in aligning the training and sampling procedures to optimize time-step utilization. Specifically, we introduced two efficient noise schedulers with 10 time steps: one with uniform time step sampling and another with non-uniform sampling. We evaluated Fast-DDPM across three medical image-to-image generation tasks: multi-image super-resolution, image denoising, and image-to-image translation. Fast-DDPM outperformed DDPM and current state-of-the-art methods based on convolutional networks and generative adversarial networks in all tasks. Additionally, Fast-DDPM reduced the training time to 0.2x and the sampling time to 0.01x compared to DDPM.

| **[Are Virtual DES Images a Valid Alternative to the Real Ones?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15594v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial, potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes clinically viable.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Conversely, light-weight models can be deployed on edge devices at lower cost but often with inferior generation quality for complex user prompts. To strike a balance between performance and cost, we propose a routing framework, called RouteT2I, which dynamically selects either the large cloud model or the light-weight edge model for each user prompt. Since generated image quality is challenging to measure and compare directly, RouteT2I establishes multi-dimensional quality metrics, particularly, by evaluating the similarity between the generated images and both positive and negative texts that describe each specific quality metric. RouteT2I then predicts the expected quality of the generated images by identifying key tokens in the prompt and comparing their impact on the quality. RouteT2I further introduces the Pareto relative superiority to compare the multi-metric quality of the generated images. Based on this comparison and predefined cost constraints, RouteT2I allocates prompts to either the edge or the cloud. Evaluation reveals that RouteT2I significantly reduces the number of requesting large cloud model while maintaining high-quality image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Designers have increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting. However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1) the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction (all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST '25)</p></details> | None |

Diffusion models excel at photorealism but struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows) without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools.

However, capturing such images is expensive and requires specialized equipment, making ODI synthesis increasingly important. While common 2D image generation and editing methods are rapidly advancing, these models struggle to deliver satisfactory results when generating or editing ODIs due to the unique format and broad 360$^{\circ}$ Field-of-View (FoV) of ODIs. To bridge this gap, we construct \textbf{\textit{Any2Omni}}, the first comprehensive ODI generation-editing dataset comprises 60,000+ training data covering diverse input conditions and up to 9 ODI generation and editing tasks. Built upon Any2Omni, we propose an \textbf{\underline{Omni}} model for \textbf{\underline{Omni}}-directional image generation and editing (\textbf{\textit{Omni$^2$}}), with the capability of handling various ODI generation and editing tasks under diverse input conditions using one model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed Omni$^2$ model for both the ODI generation and editing tasks.

This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017 demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality.

Diffusion models, though capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source, TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8% against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCVW-CV4BIOM 2025</p></details> | None |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-stage watermarking framework for diffusion models, designed to establish copyright and trace generated images back to their source. Our multi-stage watermarking technique involves embedding: (i) a fixed watermark that is localized in the diffusion model's learned noise distribution and, (ii) a human-imperceptible, dynamic watermark in generates images, leveraging a fine-tuned decoder. By leveraging the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and cosine similarity, we adapt the watermark's shape and color to the generated content while maintaining robustness. We demonstrate that our method enables reliable source verification through watermark classification, even when the dynamic watermark is adjusted for content-specific variations. Source model verification is enabled through watermark classification. o support further research, we generate a dataset of watermarked images and introduce a methodology to evaluate the statistical impact of watermarking on generated content.Additionally, we rigorously test our framework against various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and minimal impact on image quality. Our work advances the field of AI-generated content security by providing a scalable solution for model ownership verification and misuse prevention.</p></details> |  | None |

In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

An adaptation method fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets. Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities. Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the increasing resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges. Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and resolution-aware.

This is in contrast to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), which have some limitations in terms of image quality.We introduce the diffusion model to the precipitation forecasting task and propose a short-term precipitation nowcasting with condition diffusion model based on historical observational data, which is referred to as SRNDiff. By incorporating an additional conditional decoder module in the denoising process, SRNDiff achieves end-to-end conditional rainfall prediction. SRNDiff is composed of two networks: a denoising network and a conditional Encoder network. The conditional network is composed of multiple independent UNet networks. These networks extract conditional feature maps at different resolutions, providing accurate conditional information that guides the diffusion model for conditional generation.SRNDiff surpasses GANs in terms of prediction accuracy, although it requires more computational resources.The SRNDiff model exhibits higher stability and efficiency during training than GANs-based approaches, and generates high-quality precipitation distribution samples that better reflect future actual precipitation conditions. This fully validates the advantages and potential of diffusion models in precipitation forecasting, providing new insights for enhancing rainfall prediction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Inference Time Debiasing Concepts in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14933v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect 1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age. We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based text-to-image generative models.</p></details> |  | None |

As high-resolution image synthesis becomes increasingly essential for various applications, particularly in medical imaging domains, fine-tuning emerges as a crucial mechanism for adapting these powerful pre-trained models to task-specific requirements and data distributions. In this work, we present a systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We dissect how different fine-tuning methods influence key quality metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Vendi score, and prompt-image alignment. We also evaluate the utility of generated images in a downstream classification task under data-scarce conditions, demonstrating that specific fine-tuning strategies improve both generation fidelity and downstream performance when synthetic images are used for classifier training and evaluation on real images.

We propose a novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities -- such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment.

Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce \textit{two new} jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 95\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}</p></details> |  | None |

However, the quality of generated samples is highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap. Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks. Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially outperforming existing methods.

We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation, where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score of 0.97.</p></details> |  | None |

Today, most algorithms focus on generating attack samples and do not take into account the limited number of bona fide images. This work is one of the first to propose a method for mimicking bona fide images by generating synthetic versions of them using Stable Diffusion, which may help improve the generalisation capabilities of the detector. Furthermore, the new images generated are evaluated in a system trained from scratch and in a commercial solution. The PAD system yields an interesting result, as it identifies our images as bona fide, which has a positive impact on detection performance and data restrictions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CCDM: Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03546v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Conditional Generative Modeling (CCGM) estimates high-dimensional data distributions, such as images, conditioned on scalar continuous variables (aka regression labels). While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task.

Diffusion models are popular for their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an advancement in hyperspectral data generation.</p></details> |  | None |

As a result, their adoption has increased in many computer vision applications, ranging from content creation to synthetic data generation. A critical challenge is achieving precise alignment between the image, textual prompt, and layout, ensuring semantic fidelity and spatial accuracy. Although recent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked, and no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability to evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using layout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and degrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to assess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image generation. It features text-and-layout pairs spanning seven challenging scenarios, investigating object generation, color fidelity, attribute recognition, inter-object relationships, and spatial control. We propose an evaluation protocol that builds on existing frameworks by incorporating the layout alignment score to assess spatial accuracy. Using 7Bench, we evaluate several state-of-the-art diffusion models, uncovering their respective strengths and limitations across diverse alignment tasks.

However, existing ControlNet-like methods struggle with compositional visual conditioning - simultaneously preserving semantic fidelity across multiple heterogeneous control signals while maintaining high visual quality, where they employ separate control branches that often introduce conflicting guidance during the denoising process, leading to structural distortions and artifacts in generated images. To address this issue, we present PixelPonder, a novel unified control framework, which allows for effective control of multiple visual conditions under a single control structure. Specifically, we design a patch-level adaptive condition selection mechanism that dynamically prioritizes spatially relevant control signals at the sub-region level, enabling precise local guidance without global interference. Additionally, a time-aware control injection scheme is deployed to modulate condition influence according to denoising timesteps, progressively transitioning from structural preservation to texture refinement and fully utilizing the control information from different categories to promote more harmonious image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PixelPonder surpasses previous methods across different benchmark datasets, showing superior improvement in spatial alignment accuracy while maintaining high textual semantic consistency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Next Visual Granularity Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12811v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30 -> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it is still challenging to directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it is difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions. To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for unpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual contrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the extensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the self-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary networks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure preservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot image-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining the capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models without further training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stable Diffusion-Based Approach for Human De-Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12663v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task. De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions. The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as 2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | MM 2025 | None |

Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

However, when prompts involve multiple objects alongside global or local style instructions, the outputs often drift in style and lose spatial coherence, limiting their reliability for controlled, style-consistent scene generation. We present Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA), a lightweight, training-free method that splits the prompt into content and style tokens, then injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at chosen timesteps. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in the denoising process, LPA improves both layout control and stylistic uniformity without additional training cost. We conduct extensive ablations across parser settings and injection windows, finding that the best configuration -- lpa late only with a 300-650 step window -- delivers the strongest balance of prompt alignment and style consistency. On the T2I benchmark, LPA improves CLIP-prompt alignment over vanilla SDXL by +0.41% and over SD1.5 by +0.34%, with no diversity loss. On our custom 50-prompt style-rich benchmark, LPA achieves +0.09% CLIP-prompt and +0.08% CLIP-style gains over baseline. Our method is model-agnostic, easy to integrate, and requires only a single configuration change, making it a practical choice for controllable, style-consistent multi-object generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages,10 figures, pre-print</p></details> | None |

In this work, we design a modular, edge-assisted architecture that supports both direct text-to-3D and text-image-to-3D pathways, enabling interchangeable integration of state-of-the-art components and systematic comparison of their performance in AR settings. Using this architecture, we implement and evaluate four representative pipelines through an IRB-approved user study with 11 participants, assessing six perceptual and usability metrics across three object prompts. Overall, text-image-to-3D pipelines deliver higher generation quality: the best-performing pipeline, which used FLUX for image generation and Trellis for 3D generation, achieved an average satisfaction score of 4.55 out of 5 and an intent alignment score of 4.82 out of 5. In contrast, direct text-to-3D pipelines excel in speed, with the fastest, Shap-E, completing generation in about 20 seconds. Our results suggest that perceptual quality has a greater impact on user satisfaction than latency, with users tolerating longer generation times when output quality aligns with expectations. We complement subjective ratings with system-level metrics and visual analysis, providing practical insights into the trade-offs of current 3D generation methods for real-world AR deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ISMAR 2025 UNAI Workshop</p></details> | None |

This limitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal deficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To address this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models' understanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core stages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement, where an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic units and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and Adaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or optimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and substantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all evaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like "Text" and "Composition". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators (Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with Infinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline Infinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each DeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual quality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between high-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and accurate image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, evaluating the performance of image generation models remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we propose ICE-Bench, a unified and comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously assess image generation models. Its comprehensiveness could be summarized in the following key features: (1) Coarse-to-Fine Tasks: We systematically deconstruct image generation into four task categories: No-ref/Ref Image Creating/Editing, based on the presence or absence of source images and reference images. And further decompose them into 31 fine-grained tasks covering a broad spectrum of image generation requirements, culminating in a comprehensive benchmark. (2) Multi-dimensional Metrics: The evaluation framework assesses image generation capabilities across 6 dimensions: aesthetic quality, imaging quality, prompt following, source consistency, reference consistency, and controllability. 11 metrics are introduced to support the multi-dimensional evaluation. Notably, we introduce VLLM-QA, an innovative metric designed to assess the success of image editing by leveraging large models. (3) Hybrid Data: The data comes from real scenes and virtual generation, which effectively improves data diversity and alleviates the bias problem in model evaluation. Through ICE-Bench, we conduct a thorough analysis of existing generation models, revealing both the challenging nature of our benchmark and the gap between current model capabilities and real-world generation requirements. To foster further advancements in the field, we will open-source ICE-Bench, including its dataset, evaluation code, and models, thereby providing a valuable resource for the research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages.

Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods.

However, traditional workflows face challenges in communication due to the differing backgrounds of illustrators and designers, the latter with limited artistic abilities. To overcome these challenges, we created Sketchar, a Generative AI (GenAI) tool that allows designers to prototype game characters and generate images based on conceptual input, providing visual outcomes that can give immediate feedback and enhance communication with illustrators' next step in the design cycle. We conducted a mixed-method study to evaluate the interaction between game designers and Sketchar. We showed that the reference images generated in co-creating with Sketchar fostered refinement of design details and can be incorporated into real-world workflows. Moreover, designers without artistic backgrounds found the Sketchar workflow to be more expressive and worthwhile. This research demonstrates the potential of GenAI in enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration in the game industry, enabling designers to interact beyond their own limited expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI PLAY 2024</p></details> | None |

Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms.

Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Its time-intensive nature and complexity have spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, or produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically produces human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompt distribution built upon the reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles, and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Training-Free Anomaly Generation via Dual-Attention Enhancement in Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11550v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However, these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement (CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose Style-Prompting Guidance (SPG), a novel sampling strategy for style-specific image generation. SPG constructs a style noise vector and leverages its directional deviation from unconditional noise to guide the diffusion process toward the target style distribution. By integrating SPG with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), our method achieves both semantic fidelity and style consistency. SPG is simple, robust, and compatible with controllable frameworks like ControlNet and IPAdapter, making it practical and widely applicable.

Existing methods for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1) grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> |  | None |

Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability.

| **[MUNBa: Machine Unlearning via Nash Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15537v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Structured Generative Modeling with the Thermodynamic Kolmogorov-Arnold Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14167v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a top-down generative model offers an expressive and interpretable framework for text and image generation. However, it remains unclear how this interpretability can be used to guide model design, improve generative quality, and reduce training time. Moreover, the reliance on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling presents challenges in efficiency and sampling multimodal latent distributions. In this work, we propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for generative modeling and introduce the Thermodynamic Kolmogorov-Arnold Model (T-KAM) to take advantage of structural and inductive biases. By constraining the prior to univariate relationships, T-KAM enables fast and exact inference via the inverse transform method. With the low dimensionality of the latent space and suitable inductive biases encoded, we demonstrate that importance sampling becomes a viable, unbiased, and highly efficient training strategy. We also introduce a training criterion using population-based LMC, which decomposes posterior sampling into a sequence of annealed distributions to improve multimodal exploration. T-KAM elegantly balances common trade-offs in generative modeling, offering fast inference, high sample quality, and stable training, while being naturally suited to upcoming Zettascale Computing Co. hardware and extendable to other high-impact research directions in generative intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Marmot: Object-Level Self-Correction via Multi-Agent Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

It leverages a curated BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues, enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the first generative approach to unify layout-based storytelling, semantic structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel direction for generative AI in education.

Despite these technological advancements, significant ethical concerns arise from these models' reliance on large-scale datasets that often contain inherent societal biases. These biases are further amplified when AI-generated content is included in training data, potentially reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes in the generated outputs. In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel framework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social biases in T2I generation. Our framework comprises two key components: (1) an LLM-based bias detection module that identifies potential social biases in generated images based on text prompts, and (2) an attribute rebalancing module that fine-tunes sensitive attributes within the T2I model to mitigate identified biases. Our extensive experiments across various T2I models and datasets show that FairT2I can significantly reduce bias while maintaining high-quality image generation. We conducted both qualitative user studies and quantitative non-parametric analyses in the generated image feature space, building upon the occupational dataset introduced in the Stable Bias study. Our results show that FairT2I successfully mitigates social biases and enhances the diversity of sensitive attributes in generated images. We further demonstrate, using the P2 dataset, that our framework can detect subtle biases that are challenging for human observers to perceive, extending beyond occupation-related prompts. On the basis of these findings, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for evaluating bias in T2I models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HepatoGEN: Generating Hepatobiliary Phase MRI with Perceptual and Adversarial Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18405v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions, with the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) providing essential diagnostic information. However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.

The approach enables controllable synthesis and the creation of rare or out-of-distribution scenes beyond the training set. Rather than training a task-specific small model from scratch, we adapt an open-source text-to-image foundation model to the SAR modality, using its semantic prior to align prompts with SAR imaging physics (side-looking geometry, slant-range projection, and coherent speckle with heavy-tailed statistics). Using a 100k-image SAR dataset, we compare full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across the UNet diffusion backbone, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and the text encoders. Evaluation combines (i) statistical distances to real SAR amplitude distributions, (ii) textural similarity via Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) descriptors, and (iii) semantic alignment using a SAR-specialized CLIP model. Our results show that a hybrid strategy-full UNet tuning with LoRA on the text encoders and a learned token embedding-best preserves SAR geometry and texture while maintaining prompt fidelity. The framework supports text-based control and multimodal conditioning (e.g., segmentation maps, TerraSAR-X, or optical guidance), opening new paths for large-scale SAR scene data augmentation and unseen scenario simulation in Earth observation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Object Fidelity Diffusion for Remote Sensing Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10801v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase. Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploiting Discriminative Codebook Prior for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10719v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook, which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance. Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS performance.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI | None |

However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts.

Yet, recent progress in generation quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2 exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%, respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\% reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling time.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these weights are trained from scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$, comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results with 9$\boldsymbol\times$ fewer trainable parameters than the leading PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a function of parameter-efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted in the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset. First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed method.

However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer (NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically, rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style (low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality and achieving improved controllability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30 of the computational resources and 20 GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Spatially Consistent Image Generation: On Incorporating Intrinsic Scene Properties into Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10382v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[High Fidelity Text to Image Generation with Contrastive Alignment and Structural Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10280v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling. This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Invisible Watermarks, Visible Gains: Steering Machine Unlearning with Bi-Level Watermarking Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10065v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML) models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO) framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Echo-4o: Harnessing the Power of GPT-4o Synthetic Images for Improved Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09987v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind. Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data? In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries. Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o. In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Prototype-Guided Diffusion: Visual Conditioning without External Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09922v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning - without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns, enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based conditioning in diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RAGAR: Retrieval Augmented Personalized Image Generation Guided by Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01657v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image generation is crucial for improving the user experience, as it renders reference images into preferred ones according to user visual preferences. Although effective, existing methods face two main issues. First, existing methods treat all items in the user historical sequence equally when extracting user preferences, overlooking the varying semantic similarities between historical items and the reference item. Disproportionately high weights for low-similarity items distort users' visual preferences for the reference item. Second, existing methods heavily rely on consistency between generated and reference images to optimize the generation, which leads to underfitting user preferences and hinders personalization. To address these issues, we propose Retrieval Augment Personalized Image GenerAtion guided by Recommendation (RAGAR). Our approach uses a retrieval mechanism to assign different weights to historical items according to their similarities to the reference item, thereby extracting more refined users' visual preferences for the reference item. Then we introduce a novel rank task based on the multi-modal ranking model to optimize the personalization of the generated images instead of forcing depend on consistency. Extensive experiments and human evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAR achieves significant improvements in both personalization and semantic metrics compared to five baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Our analysis centers on fully quantum implementations of both the generator and discriminator. Through extensive numerical testing of current main architectures, we find that QGANs struggle to generalize across datasets, converging on merely the average representation of the training data. When the output of the generator is a pure-state, we analytically derive a lower bound for the discriminator quality given by the fidelity between the pure-state output of the generator and the target data distribution, thereby providing a theoretical explanation for the limitations observed in current models. Our findings reveal fundamental challenges in the generalization capabilities of existing quantum generative models. While our analysis focuses on QGANs, the results carry broader implications for the performance of related quantum generative models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures | None |

While prior work has largely focused on improving alignment by refining the diffusion process, we focus on the textual encoding stage. Specifically, we investigate how semantic information is distributed across token representations within and between lexical items (i.e., words or expressions conveying a single concept) in the prompt. We analyze information flow at two levels: (1) in-item representation-whether individual tokens represent their lexical item, and (2) cross-item interaction-whether information flows across the tokens of different lexical items. We use patching techniques to uncover surprising encoding patterns. We find information is usually concentrated in only one or two of the item's tokens-For example, in the item "San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge", the token "Gate" sufficiently captures the entire expression while the other tokens could effectively be discarded. Lexical items also tend to remain isolated; for instance, the token "dog" encodes no visual information about "green" in the prompt "a green dog". However, in some cases, items do influence each other's representation, often leading to misinterpretations-e.g., in the prompt "a pool by a table", the token pool represents a pool table after contextualization. Our findings highlight the critical role of token-level encoding in image generation, suggesting that misalignment issues may originate already during the textual encoding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Images Speak Louder Than Scores: Failure Mode Escape for Enhancing Generative Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09598v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores, state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images, especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work, we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual Recursive Feedback on Generation and Appearance Latents for Pose-Robust Text-to-Image Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09575v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF) system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models. The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically coherent, and structurally consistent image generations.

(i.e., closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments, we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.</p></details> |  | None |

A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network (ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12, respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Algorithms for Computational Intelligence Systems (IACIS)</p></details> | None |

Most AII detectors often employ the conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs (generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images, optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by various image generators.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Failed Samples: A Few-Shot and Training-Free Framework for Generalized Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09475v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a ``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task, where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding, deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network (FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set, mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation, each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\% compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.</p></details> |  | None |

This capability substantially reduces human labor and production costs in traditional marketing workflows. However, existing AIGC techniques either demand extensive fine-tuning for each referenced image to achieve high fidelity, or they struggle to maintain fidelity across diverse products, making them impractical for e-commerce and marketing industries. To tackle this limitation, we first construct AdProd-100K, a large-scale advertising image generation dataset. A key innovation in its construction is our dual data augmentation strategy, which fosters robust, 3D-aware representations crucial for realistic and high-fidelity image synthesis. Leveraging this dataset, we propose RefAdGen, a generation framework that achieves high fidelity through a decoupled design. The framework enforces precise spatial control by injecting a product mask at the U-Net input, and employs an efficient Attention Fusion Module (AFM) to integrate product features. This design effectively resolves the fidelity-efficiency dilemma present in existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RefAdGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, showcasing robust generalization by maintaining high fidelity and remarkable visual results for both unseen products and challenging real-world, in-the-wild images. This offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional workflows.

Surprisingly, we found that dementia detection is possible from generated images alone achieving 75% accuracy on the ADReSS dataset.

Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency. Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1 Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages, particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally, our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit (stated) as well as implicit (unstated, implied by the prompt's cultural context) cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we show that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, provide a concrete testbed, and outline actionable directions for developing culturally informed T2I models and metrics that improve global usability.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to their characteristics including world knowledge and generalizability, artistic style and creativity, and multimodal integration, we envision that GenAI may benefit a variety of cartographic design decisions, from mapmaking (e.g., conceptualization, data preparation, map design, and map evaluation) to map use (such as map reading, interpretation, and analysis). This paper discusses several important topics regarding why and how GenAI benefits cartography with case studies including symbolization, map evaluation, and map reading. Despite its unprecedented potential, we identify key scenarios where GenAI may not be suitable, such as tasks that require a deep understanding of cartographic knowledge or prioritize precision and reliability. We also emphasize the need to consider ethical and social implications, such as concerns related to hallucination, reproducibility, bias, copyright, and explainability. This work lays the foundation for further exploration and provides a roadmap for future research at the intersection of GenAI and cartography.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

The rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task. However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat: a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details. Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.</p></details> |  | None |

Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Masked Autoencoder Self Pre-Training for Defect Detection in Microelectronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10021v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While transformers have surpassed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in various computer vision tasks, microelectronics defect detection still largely relies on CNNs. We hypothesize that this gap is due to the fact that a) transformers have an increased need for data and b) (labelled) image generation procedures for microelectronics are costly, and data is therefore sparse. Whereas in other domains, pre-training on large natural image datasets can mitigate this problem, in microelectronics transfer learning is hindered due to the dissimilarity of domain data and natural images. We address this challenge through self pre-training, where models are pre-trained directly on the target dataset, rather than another dataset. We propose a resource-efficient vision transformer (ViT) pre-training framework for defect detection in microelectronics based on masked autoencoders (MAE). We perform pre-training and defect detection using a dataset of less than 10,000 scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) images. Our experimental results show that our approach leads to substantial performance gains compared to a) supervised ViT, b) ViT pre-trained on natural image datasets, and c) state-of-the-art CNN-based defect detection models used in microelectronics. Additionally, interpretability analysis reveals that our self pre-trained models attend to defect-relevant features such as cracks in the solder material, while baseline models often attend to spurious patterns. This shows that our approach yields defect-specific feature representations, resulting in more interpretable and generalizable transformer models for this data-sparse domain.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures | None |

Recent methods based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1) token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA (TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules.

| **[SafeFix: Targeted Model Repair via Controlled Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08701v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes, repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases. To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model robustness without introducing new bugs.

Generating 1K Video within 16 Seconds using Extremely Compressed Motion Latents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13552v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity results but are still restricted to limited access. One crucial obstacle for large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this paper, we argue that videos contain significantly more redundant information than images, allowing them to be encoded with very few motion latents. Towards this goal, we design an image-conditioned VAE that projects videos into extremely compressed latent space and decode them based on content images. This magic Reducio charm enables 64x reduction of latents compared to a common 2D VAE, without sacrificing the quality. Building upon Reducio-VAE, we can train diffusion models for high-resolution video generation efficiently. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage generation paradigm, first generating a condition image via text-to-image generation, followed by text-image-to-video generation with the proposed Reducio-DiT. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves strong performance in evaluation. More importantly, our method significantly boosts the training and inference efficiency of video LDMs. Reducio-DiT is trained in just 3.2K A100 GPU hours in total and can generate a 16-frame 1024$\times$1024 video clip within 15.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

| **[Learning User Preferences for Image Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08220v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes'' and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating images that align with individual tastes.

However, Current data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios. Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality. Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |

Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images. To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the quadratic scaling properties of the attention in DiTs hinder image generation with higher resolution or on devices with limited resources. This work introduces an efficient diffusion transformer (EDiT) to alleviate these efficiency bottlenecks in conventional DiTs and Multimodal DiTs (MM-DiTs). First, we present a novel linear compressed attention method that uses a multi-layer convolutional network to modulate queries with local information while keys and values are aggregated spatially. Second, we formulate a hybrid attention scheme for multimodal inputs that combines linear attention for image-to-image interactions and standard scaled dot-product attention for interactions involving prompts. Merging these two approaches leads to an expressive, linear-time Multimodal Efficient Diffusion Transformer (MM-EDiT). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EDiT and MM-EDiT architectures by integrating them into PixArt-Sigma (conventional DiT) and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Medium (MM-DiT), achieving up to 2.2x speedup with comparable image quality after distillation.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately, relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshop (AI4CC)</p></details> | None |
| **[Grouped Speculative Decoding for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07747v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference, leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without requiring any additional training.

Existing image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion, which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly. Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (oral).

In this paper, we first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets.

Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep, incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants: OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a 1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.</p></details> |  | None |

As a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble \textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a \textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and allowing attacks across various tasks. CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks substitute models. In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100 queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Different from prior works that require complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM's hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, [object Object]. This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm. Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility. When training T2I LLMs from scratch, ARRA reduces FID by 16.6% (ImageNet), 12.0% (LAION-COCO) for autoregressive LLMs like LlamaGen, without modifying original architecture and inference mechanism. For training from text-generation-only LLMs, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet) for advanced LLMs like Chameleon. For domain adaptation, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). These results demonstrate that training objective redesign, rather than architectural modifications, can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges. ARRA offers a complementary paradigm for advancing autoregressive models.

Different from most existing studies, ours does not involve any pretrained model for the unknown score functions of the noise-perturbed data distributions, nor does it attempt to learn the score functions. Instead, we formulate the problem as entropy-regularized continuous-time RL and show that the optimal stochastic policy has a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance matrix. Based on this result, we parameterize the mean of Gaussian policies and develop an actor--critic type (little) q-learning algorithm to solve the RL problem. A key ingredient in our algorithm design is to obtain noisy observations from the unknown score function via a ratio estimator. Our formulation can also be adapted to solve pure score-matching and fine-tuning pretrained models. Numerically, we show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with two state-of-the-art RL methods that fine-tune pretrained models on several generative tasks including high-dimensional image generations. Finally, we discuss extensions of our RL formulation to probability flow ODE implementation of diffusion models and to conditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning.

Existing methods primarily focus on static image analysis and lack the dynamic generation of medical imagery from textual descriptions. This study intends to partially close this gap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to generate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions. Particularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity medical images. The problem is around two sub-tasks namely: image synthesis (IS) and optimal prompt production (OPG). The former creates medical images via verbal prompts, whereas the latter provides prompts that produce high-quality images in specified categories. The study emphasizes the limitations of traditional medical image generation methods, such as hand sketching, constrained datasets, static procedures, and generic models. Our evaluation measures showed that Stable Diffusion surpasses CLIP and DreamBooth + LORA in terms of producing high-quality, diversified images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion had the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores (0.099 for single center, 0.064 for multi-center, and 0.067 for combined), indicating higher image quality. Furthermore, it had the highest average Inception Score (2.327 across all datasets), indicating exceptional diversity and quality. This advances the field of AI-powered medical diagnosis. Future research will concentrate on model refining, dataset augmentation, and ethical considerations for efficiently implementing these advances into clinical practice</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT, or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Prompt-Softbox-Prompt: A Free-Text Embedding Control for Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13623v3)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While text-driven diffusion models demonstrate remarkable performance in image editing, the critical components of their text embeddings remain underexplored. The ambiguity and entanglement of these embeddings pose challenges for precise editing. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of text embeddings in Stable Diffusion XL, offering three key insights: (1) \textit{aug embedding}~\footnote{\textit{aug embedding} is obtained by combining the pooled output of the final text encoder with the timestep embeddings. https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers} retains complete textual semantics but contributes minimally to image generation as it is only fused via the ResBlocks. More text information weakens its local semantics while preserving most global semantics. (2) \textit{BOS} and \textit{padding embedding} do not contain any semantic information. (3) \textit{EOS} holds the semantic information of all words and stylistic information. Each word embedding is important and does not interfere with the semantic injection of other embeddings. Based on these insights, we propose PSP (\textbf{P}rompt-\textbf{S}oftbox-\textbf{P}rompt), a training-free image editing method that leverages free-text embedding. PSP enables precise image editing by modifying text embeddings within the cross-attention layers and using Softbox to control the specific area for semantic injection. This technique enables the addition and replacement of objects without affecting other areas of the image. Additionally, PSP can achieve style transfer by simply replacing text embeddings. Extensive experiments show that PSP performs remarkably well in tasks such as object replacement, object addition, and style transfer.

We adapt the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines. Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics, establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis.

Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language models (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in rhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual representations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize object-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to steer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended semantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that formulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy optimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the outer layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated sub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing semantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward sparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing every adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical text-to-image generation. Our model outperforms SOTA MLLMs such as GPT-4o, Grok-3 and leading academic baselines across both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing. Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image generation and editing tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have re-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match diffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion models fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences in structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of attention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image editing, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we introduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing strategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention manipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by dynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the Anchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural consistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing while maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional training and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our findings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing, further bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive generative models.

However, current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs -- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references. We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990 synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33 reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual inspiration.

However, currently there is no straightforward and efficient framework to transfer the multimodal comprehension abilities of MLLMs to T2I models to enable them to understand multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose the X2I framework, which endows Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models with the capability to comprehend various modalities, including multilingual text, screenshot documents, images, videos, and audio. X2I is trained using merely 100K English corpus with 160 GPU hours. Building on the DiT teacher model, we adopt an innovative distillation method to extract the inference capabilities of the teacher model and design a lightweight AlignNet structure to serve as an intermediate bridge. Compared to the teacher model, X2I shows a decrease in performance degradation of less than 1\% while gaining various multimodal understanding abilities, including multilingual to image, image to image, image-text to image, video to image, audio to image, and utilizing creative fusion to enhance imagery. Furthermore, it is applicable for LoRA training in the context of image-text to image generation, filling a void in the industry in this area. We further design a simple LightControl to enhance the fidelity of instructional image editing. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, multifunctionality, and transferability of our X2I.

| **[Towards Robust Red-Green Watermarking for Autoregressive Image Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06656v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive (AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images. Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality. Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime, comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing tools often require users to externalize ideas through prompts or references, limiting fluid exploration. We introduce ThematicPlane, a system that enables users to navigate and manipulate high-level semantic concepts (e.g., mood, style, or narrative tone) within an interactive thematic design plane. This interface bridges the gap between tacit creative intent and system control. In our exploratory study (N=6), participants engaged in divergent and convergent creative modes, often embracing unexpected results as inspiration or iteration cues. While they grounded their exploration in familiar themes, differing expectations of how themes mapped to outputs revealed a need for more explainable controls. Overall, ThematicPlane fosters expressive, iterative workflows and highlights new directions for intuitive, semantics-driven interaction in generative design tools.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in (1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used image editing benchmarks.

Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training.

Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D texture generation domain is that most existing approaches rely on repeated calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To alleviate these issues, we propose an end-to-end differentiable, reinforcement-learning-free framework that embeds human feedback, expressed as differentiable reward functions, directly into the 3D texture synthesis pipeline. By back-propagating preference signals through both geometric and appearance modules of the proposed framework, our method generates textures that respect the 3D geometry structure and align with desired criteria. To demonstrate its versatility, we introduce three novel geometry-aware reward functions, which offer a more controllable and interpretable pathway for creating high-quality 3D content from natural language. By conducting qualitative, quantitative, and user-preference evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that our proposed strategy consistently outperforms existing approaches. We will make our implementation code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  | None |

Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning models, has been widely adopted in applications such as crop monitoring, pest detection, and yield prediction. Among recent generative models, diffusion models have demonstrated considerable potential in agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote sensing analysis. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models exhibit greater training stability and superior image generation quality, effectively addressing challenges such as limited annotated datasets and imbalanced sample distributions in agricultural scenarios. This paper reviews recent advancements in the application of diffusion models within agriculture, focusing on their roles in crop disease and pest detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth prediction, and agricultural resource management. Diffusion models have been found useful in improving tasks like image generation, denoising, and data augmentation in agriculture, especially when environmental noise or variability is present. While their high computational requirements and limited generalizability across domains remain concerns, the approach is gradually proving effective in real-world applications such as precision crop monitoring. As research progresses, these models may help support sustainable agriculture and address emerging challenges in food systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically we match the first and second order central moments of the DDPM forward marginals by constraining the parameters of the GMM. We see that moment matching is sufficient to obtain samples with equal or better quality than the original DDIM with Gaussian kernels. We provide experimental results with unconditional models trained on CelebAHQ and FFHQ, class-conditional models trained on ImageNet, and text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion v2.1 on COYO700M datasets respectively. Our results suggest that using the GMM kernel leads to significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples when the number of sampling steps is small, as measured by FID and IS metrics. For example on ImageNet 256x256, using 10 sampling steps, we achieve a FID of 6.94 and IS of 207.85 with a GMM kernel compared to 10.15 and 196.73 respectively with a Gaussian kernel.

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories caused by fragmented architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this, CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple vehicle configurations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |

Prior research attempt to employ a single reconstruction-targeted Vector Quantization (VQ) encoder for unifying these two tasks. We observe that understanding and generation require fundamentally different granularities of visual information. This leads to a critical trade-off, particularly compromising performance in multimodal understanding tasks. TokenFlow addresses this challenge through an innovative dual-codebook architecture that decouples semantic and pixel-level feature learning while maintaining their alignment via a shared mapping mechanism. This design enables direct access to both high-level semantic representations crucial for understanding tasks and fine-grained visual features essential for generation through shared indices. Our extensive experiments demonstrate TokenFlow's superiority across multiple dimensions. Leveraging TokenFlow, we demonstrate for the first time that discrete visual input can surpass LLaVA-1.5 13B in understanding performance, achieving a 7.2\% average improvement. For image reconstruction, we achieve a strong FID score of 0.63 at 384*384 resolution.

In this paper, we propose \textbf{$M^{2}Chat$}, a novel unified multimodal LLM framework for generating interleaved text-image conversation across various scenarios. Specifically, we propose an $M^{3}Adapter$ that efficiently integrates granular low-level visual information and high-level semantic features from multi-modality prompts. Upon the well-aligned fused feature, $M^{3}Adapter$ tailors a learnable gating strategy to balance the model creativity and consistency across various tasks adaptively. Moreover, to further enhance the effectiveness of $M^{3}Adapter$ while preserving the coherence of semantic context comprehension, we introduce a two-stage $M^{3}FT$ fine-tuning strategy.

| **[Masked Training for Robust Arrhythmia Detection from Digitalized Multiple Layout ECG Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09165v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) as an important tool for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia. Due to the differences in ECG layouts used by different hospitals, the digitized signals exhibit asynchronous lead time and partial blackout loss, which poses a serious challenge to existing models. To address this challenge, the study introduced PatchECG, a framework for adaptive variable block count missing representation learning based on a masking training strategy, which automatically focuses on key patches with collaborative dependencies between leads, thereby achieving key recognition of arrhythmia in ECGs with different layouts. Experiments were conducted on the PTB-XL dataset and 21388 asynchronous ECG images generated using ECG image kit tool, using the 23 Subclasses as labels. The proposed method demonstrated strong robustness under different layouts, with average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.835 and remained stable (unchanged with layout changes). In external validation based on 400 real ECG images data from Chaoyang Hospital, the AUROC for atrial fibrillation diagnosis reached 0.778; On 12 x 1 layout ECGs, AUROC reaches 0.893. This result is superior to various classic interpolation and baseline methods, and compared to the current optimal large-scale pre-training model ECGFounder, it has improved by 0.111 and 0.19.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Slice or the Whole Pie? Utility Control for AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06551v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead, NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation, using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of tasks without requiring a lot of changes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Taxonomy of Faults in Attention-Based Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04925v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96 projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.</p></details> |  | None |

As a result, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation has been proposed to leverage region-specific positions and descriptions to enable more precise and controllable generation. However, previous methods primarily focus on UNet-based models (\eg SD1.5 and SDXL), and limited effort has explored Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs), which have demonstrated powerful image generation capabilities. Enabling MM-DiT for layout-to-image generation seems straightforward but is challenging due to the complexity of how layout is introduced, integrated, and balanced among multiple modalities. To this end, we explore various network variants to efficiently incorporate layout guidance into MM-DiT, and ultimately present SiamLayout. To inherit the advantages of MM-DiT, we use a separate set of network weights to process the layout, treating it as equally important as the image and text modalities. Meanwhile, to alleviate the competition among modalities, we decouple the image-layout interaction into a siamese branch alongside the image-text one and fuse them in the later stage. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale layout dataset, named LayoutSAM, which includes 2.7 million image-text pairs and 10.7 million entities. Each entity is annotated with a bounding box and a detailed description. We further construct the LayoutSAM-Eval benchmark as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the L2I generation quality. Finally, we introduce the Layout Designer, which taps into the potential of large language models in layout planning, transforming them into experts in layout generation and optimization. These components form CreatiLayout -- a systematic solution that integrates the layout model, dataset, and planner for creative layout-to-image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[PiT: Progressive Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13219v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within image generation via the transformer architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global modeling transformers, which face significant quadratic computational cost. However, through empirical analysis, we find that DiTs do not rely as heavily on global information as previously believed. In fact, most layers exhibit significant redundancy in global computation. Additionally, conventional attention mechanisms suffer from low-frequency inertia, limiting their efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Pseudo Shifted Window Attention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global attention redundancy. PSWA achieves moderate global-local information through window attention. It further utilizes a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, which both enrich the high-frequency information and strengthen inter-window connections. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation (PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention without additional computational cost. Based on these innovations, we propose a series of Pseudo \textbf{P}rogressive D\textbf{i}ffusion \textbf{T}ransformer (\textbf{PiT}). Our extensive experiments show their superior performance; for example, our proposed PiT-L achieves 54\%$\uparrow$ FID improvement over DiT-XL/2 while using less computation.</p></details> |  | None |

We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the success of AI as a service for multi-modal applications, it relies heavily on clouds, which are constrained by bandwidth, latency, privacy concerns, and unavailability under network or server failures. While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting multiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To address this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for multi-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of multi-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder, classifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level modules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby reducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module sharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel routing by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a testbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks, we demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in single-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, S2M3 achieves optimal placement in 89 out of 95 instances (93.7%) while reducing inference latency by up to 56.9% on resource-constrained devices, compared to cloud AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2025)</p></details> | None |

While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views. Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

While some recent works have explored Differential Privacy (DP) to mitigate these privacy risks, DP-based training is known to cause significant performance degradation and impose several limitations on standard training procedures, making its direct application to downstream tasks both difficult and costly. In this work, we aim to address the above challenges within the context of document image classification by substituting real private data with a synthetic counterpart. In particular, we propose to use conditional latent diffusion models (LDMs) in combination with differential privacy (DP) to generate class-specific synthetic document images under strict privacy constraints, which can then be utilized to train a downstream classifier following standard training procedures. We investigate our approach under various pretraining setups, including unconditional, class-conditional, and layout-conditional pretraining, in combination with multiple private training strategies such as class-conditional and per-label private fine-tuning with DPDM and DP-Promise algorithms. Additionally, we evaluate it on two well-known document benchmark datasets, RVL-CDIP and Tobacco3482, and show that it can generate useful and realistic document samples across various document types and privacy levels ($\varepsilon \in \{1, 5, 10\}$). Lastly, we show that our approach achieves substantial performance improvements in downstream evaluations on small-scale datasets, compared to the direct application of DP-Adam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDAR 2025</p></details> | None |

The ViT-22B model, trained from scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation, which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more suitable structure for image generation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |

Although many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS dataset will be released soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was originally submitted to ACM MM 2025 on April 12, 2025</p></details> | None |

In CVTG, image generation models often rendering distorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these challenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method. TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the performance of generative models on CVTG tasks.

To address these concerns, protection perturbation algorithms have been developed to disrupt forgery generation. However, the protection algorithms would become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques to bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach, Anti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within the perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations, where the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the authorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both protection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain under the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does not disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the authorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels, preserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering. ATP demonstrates its effectiveness in defending forgery attacks across various attack settings through extensive experiments, providing a robust solution for protecting individuals' portrait rights and privacy.

Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence. Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control, through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images. Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many situations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are available. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.</p></details> |  | None |

A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

A Case Study on Stable Diffusion Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09014v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models are nowadays widely used to generate graphical content used for multiple purposes, e.g. web, art, advertisement. However, it has been shown that the images generated by these models could reinforce societal biases already existing in specific contexts. In this paper, we focus on understanding if this is the case when one generates images related to various software engineering tasks. In fact, the Software Engineering (SE) community is not immune from gender and ethnicity disparities, which could be amplified by the use of these models. Hence, if used without consciousness, artificially generated images could reinforce these biases in the SE domain. Specifically, we perform an extensive empirical evaluation of the gender and ethnicity bias exposed by three versions of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model (a very popular open-source text-to-image model) - SD 2, SD XL, and SD 3 - towards SE tasks. We obtain 6,720 images by feeding each model with two sets of prompts describing different software-related tasks: one set includes the Software Engineer keyword, and one set does not include any specification of the person performing the task. Next, we evaluate the gender and ethnicity disparities in the generated images. Results show how all models are significantly biased towards male figures when representing software engineers. On the contrary, while SD 2 and SD XL are strongly biased towards White figures, SD 3 is slightly more biased towards Asian figures. Nevertheless, all models significantly under-represent Black and Arab figures, regardless of the prompt style used. The results of our analysis highlight severe concerns about adopting those models to generate content for SE tasks and open the field for future research on bias mitigation in this context.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their high computational cost and large parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors; (2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ, and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories. Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.</p></details> |  | None |

With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the development of image translation models for scientific use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at A&A; 18+6 pages; 12+6 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[FFHQ-Makeup: Paired Synthetic Makeup Dataset with Facial Consistency Across Multiple Styles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03241v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression, undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://yangxingchao.github.io/FFHQ-Makeup-page, Datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/cyberagent/FFHQ-Makeup</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yangxingchao.github.io/FFHQ-Makeup-page) |

To improve inference efficiency without compromising quality, we propose Bridged Progressive Rectified Flow Transformers (NAMI), which decompose the generation process across temporal, spatial, and architectural demensions. We divide the rectified flow into different stages according to resolution, and use a BridgeFlow module to connect them. Fewer Transformer layers are used at low-resolution stages to generate image layouts and concept contours, and more layers are progressively added as the resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves fast convergence and reduces inference time while ensuring generation quality. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We introduce Bridged Progressive Rectified Flow Transformers that enable multi-resolution training, accelerating model convergence; (2) NAMI leverages piecewise flow and spatial cascading of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to rapidly generate images, reducing inference time by 64% for generating 1024 resolution images; (3) We propose a BridgeFlow module to align flows between different stages; (4) We propose the NAMI-1K benchmark to evaluate human preference performance, aiming to mitigate distributional bias and comprehensively assess model effectiveness. The results show that our model is competitive with state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Content: How Grammatical Gender Shapes Visual Representation in Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03199v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models. Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\% on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects. Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.</p></details> |  | None |

By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, namely, adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timesteps of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a viable alternative to conditional generation.

While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices, the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image. The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps: understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3. The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop. This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence, delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluators are typically narrow in specific tasks and aspects. In this paper, we argue that, on one hand, based on the interconnected nature of aspects, learning specific aspects can generalize to unseen aspects; on the other hand, jointly learning to assess multiple visual aspects and tasks may foster a synergistic effect. To this end, we propose UFEval, the first unified fine-grained evaluator with task and aspect generalization for four evaluation tasks -- Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. Specifically, (1) We first construct a hierarchical aspect taxonomy encompassing 112 distinct aspects across the aforementioned four tasks. (2) Then, building upon this taxonomy, we create FRABench, a fine-grained evaluation dataset comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k evaluation labels obtained from a combination of human and GPT-4o annotations. FRABench provides a large-scale, multi-modal, and aspect-level resource for training and testing evaluators. (3) Finally, leveraging FRABench, we develop UFEval, a unified fine-grained evaluator. Experiments show that learning on specific aspects enables UFEval to generalize to unseen aspects, and joint learning to assess diverse tasks and aspects can lead to substantial mutual benefits.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior detection methods have focused on filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

To address this, network quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the quality of the generated images across various datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

We extend our previous work on exoticism (Ghosh et al., 2024) of 'Global South' countries from across the world, as depicted by GAI tools. We analyze generated images of individuals from 13 countries -- India, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Egypt, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Sudan, Libya, Venezuela, Colombia, Indonesia, Honduras, and Mexico -- performing everyday activities (such as being at home, going to work, getting groceries, etc.), as opposed to images for the same activities being performed by persons from 3 'Global North' countries -- USA, UK, Australia. While outputs for 'Global North' demonstrate a difference across images and people clad in activity-appropriate attire, individuals from 'Global South' countries are depicted in similar attire irrespective of the performed activity, indicative of a pattern of exoticism where attire or other cultural features are overamplified at the cost of accuracy. We further show qualitatively-analyzed case studies that demonstrate how exoticism is not simply performed upon 'Global South' countries but also upon marginalized populations even in Western contexts, as we observe a similar exoticization of Indigenous populations in the 'Global North', and doubly upon marginalized populations within 'Global South' countries. We document implications for harm-aware usage patterns of such tools, and steps towards designing better GAI tools through community-centered endeavors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upcom...</summary><p>Upcoming Publication, AIES 2025</p></details> | None |

It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics. To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM MM'25</p></details> | None |
| **[SEAL: Semantic Aware Image Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12172v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have rapidly evolved to generate realistic outputs. However, their synthetic outputs increasingly challenge the clear distinction between natural and AI-generated content, necessitating robust watermarking techniques. Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the target image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication onto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent watermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise. Yet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely on searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection. In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic information about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a distortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of key patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic embedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore, conditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves robustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two largely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial noise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker inserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image, possibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's increased robustness to these attacks. Taken together, our results suggest that content-aware watermarks can mitigate risks arising from image-generative models.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection, filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering, evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result, Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image) |

While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized adapter integration.</p></details> |  | None |

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt. This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer, generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance. Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully reflecting the image prompt.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

While traditional style transfer methods and modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) strive to achieve this balance, they often struggle to do so without sacrificing either style, content, or sometimes both. This work addresses this challenge by analyzing the ability of DDPMs to maintain content and style equilibrium. We introduce a novel method to identify sensitivities within the DDPM attention layers, identifying specific layers that correspond to different stylistic aspects. By directing conditional inputs only to these sensitive layers, our approach enables fine-grained control over style and content, significantly reducing issues arising from over-constrained inputs. Our findings demonstrate that this method enhances recent stylization techniques by better aligning style and content, ultimately improving the quality of generated visual content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper at CVPR 2025.

Classical approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D}, a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures | None |

An intuitive approach is to extend previous image-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such as score distillation sampling.However, this approach would be slow and expensive to scale due to the need for back-propagating the information-limited supervision signals through a large pretrained model. To address this, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to directly reconstruct the 4D content through a 4D Gaussian splatting model. Importantly, our method can achieve real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories. To enable robust reconstruction under sparse views, we introduce inconsistency-aware confidence-weighted loss design, along with a lightly weighted score distillation loss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed when compared to prior art alternatives while preserving the quality of novel view synthesis. For example, Efficient4D takes only 10 minutes to model a dynamic object, vs 120 minutes by the previous art model Consistent4D.</p></details> | Technical report | None |

While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the alignment of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which are responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts, which we refer to as prompt-aware diversity. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the Schur Complement ENtopy DIversity (Scendi) score, as a measure of the prompt-aware diversity for prompt-guided generative models. Additionally, we discuss the application of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt on the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of the embedded vectors on specific objects. We present several numerical results that apply our proposed Scendi score to evaluate text-to-image and LLM (text-to-text) models.

| **[Practical, Generalizable and Robust Backdoor Attacks on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01605v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality and diverse images from text prompts, yet recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. Existing attack methods suffer from critical limitations: 1) they rely on unnatural adversarial prompts that lack human readability and require massive poisoned data; 2) their effectiveness is typically restricted to specific models, lacking generalizability; and 3) they can be mitigated by recent backdoor defenses. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel backdoor attack framework that achieves three key properties: 1) \emph{Practicality}: Our attack requires only a few stealthy backdoor samples to generate arbitrary attacker-chosen target images, as well as ensuring high-quality image generation in benign scenarios. 2) \emph{Generalizability:} The attack is applicable across multiple T2I DMs without requiring model-specific redesign. 3) \emph{Robustness:} The attack remains effective against existing backdoor defenses and adaptive defenses. Our extensive experimental results on multiple T2I DMs demonstrate that with only 10 carefully crafted backdoored samples, our attack method achieves $>$90\% attack success rate with negligible degradation in benign image generation quality. We also conduct human evaluation to validate our attack effectiveness. Furthermore, recent backdoor detection and mitigation methods, as well as adaptive defense tailored to our attack are not sufficiently effective, highlighting the pressing need for more robust defense mechanisms against the proposed attack.</p></details> |  | None |
