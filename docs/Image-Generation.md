| **[Unified Autoregressive Visual Generation and Understanding with Continuous Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13436v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present UniFluid, a unified autoregressive framework for joint visual generation and understanding leveraging continuous visual tokens. Our unified autoregressive architecture processes multimodal image and text inputs, generating discrete tokens for text and continuous tokens for image. We find though there is an inherent trade-off between the image generation and understanding task, a carefully tuned training recipe enables them to improve each other. By selecting an appropriate loss balance weight, the unified model achieves results comparable to or exceeding those of single-task baselines on both tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that employing stronger pre-trained LLMs and random-order generation during training is important to achieve high-fidelity image generation within this unified framework. Built upon the Gemma model series, UniFluid exhibits competitive performance across both image generation and understanding, demonstrating strong transferability to various downstream tasks, including image editing for generation, as well as visual captioning and question answering for understanding.</p></details> | Tech report | None |

In this work, we introduce BlobCtrl, a framework that unifies element-level generation and editing using a probabilistic blob-based representation. By employing blobs as visual primitives, our approach effectively decouples and represents spatial location, semantic content, and identity information, enabling precise element-level manipulation. Our key contributions include: 1) a dual-branch diffusion architecture with hierarchical feature fusion for seamless foreground-background integration; 2) a self-supervised training paradigm with tailored data augmentation and score functions; and 3) controllable dropout strategies to balance fidelity and diversity. To support further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale training and BlobBench for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that BlobCtrl excels in various element-level manipulation tasks while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for precise and flexible visual content creation.

| **[Robust Latent Matters: Boosting Image Generation with Sampling Error Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08354v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image generation schemes typically capture image distribution in a pre-constructed latent space relying on a frozen image tokenizer. Though the performance of tokenizer plays an essential role to the successful generation, its current evaluation metrics (e.g. rFID) fail to precisely assess the tokenizer and correlate its performance to the generation quality (e.g. gFID). In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for the discrepancy of reconstruction and generation qualities in a discrete latent space, and, from which, we propose a novel plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme to facilitate latent space construction. Specifically, a latent perturbation approach is proposed to simulate sampling noises, i.e., the unexpected tokens sampled, from the generative process. With the latent perturbation, we further propose (1) a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, i.e., pFID, which successfully correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality and (2) a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of tokenizer thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed. Extensive benchmarking are conducted with 11 advanced discrete image tokenizers with 2 autoregressive generation models to validate our approach. The tokenizer trained with our proposed latent perturbation achieve a notable 1.60 gFID with classifier-free guidance (CFG) and 3.45 gFID without CFG with a $\sim$400M generator.

| **[MAME: Multidimensional Adaptive Metamer Exploration with Human Perceptual Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13212v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment between human brain networks and artificial models is actively studied in machine learning and neuroscience. A widely adopted approach to explore their functional alignment is to identify metamers for both humans and models. Metamers refer to input stimuli that are physically different but equivalent within a given system. If a model's metameric space completely matched the human metameric space, the model would achieve functional alignment with humans. However, conventional methods lack direct ways to search for human metamers. Instead, researchers first develop biologically inspired models and then infer about human metamers indirectly by testing whether model metamers also appear as metamers to humans. Here, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Metamer Exploration (MAME) framework, enabling direct high-dimensional exploration of human metameric space. MAME leverages online image generation guided by human perceptual feedback. Specifically, it modulates reference images across multiple dimensions by leveraging hierarchical responses from convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Generated images are presented to participants whose perceptual discriminability is assessed in a behavioral task. Based on participants' responses, subsequent image generation parameters are adaptively updated online. Using our MAME framework, we successfully measured a human metameric space of over fifty dimensions within a single experiment. Experimental results showed that human discrimination sensitivity was lower for metameric images based on low-level features compared to high-level features, which image contrast metrics could not explain. The finding suggests that the model computes low-level information not essential for human perception. Our framework has the potential to contribute to developing interpretable AI and understanding of brain function in neuroscience.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Rewards Are Enough for Fast Photo-Realistic Text-to-image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13070v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generated images to complicated text prompts and human preferences is a central challenge in Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC). With reward-enhanced diffusion distillation emerging as a promising approach that boosts controllability and fidelity of text-to-image models, we identify a fundamental paradigm shift: as conditions become more specific and reward signals stronger, the rewards themselves become the dominant force in generation. In contrast, the diffusion losses serve as an overly expensive form of regularization. To thoroughly validate our hypothesis, we introduce R0, a novel conditional generation approach via regularized reward maximization. Instead of relying on tricky diffusion distillation losses, R0 proposes a new perspective that treats image generations as an optimization problem in data space which aims to search for valid images that have high compositional rewards. By innovative designs of the generator parameterization and proper regularization techniques, we train state-of-the-art few-step text-to-image generative models with R0 at scales. Our results challenge the conventional wisdom of diffusion post-training and conditional generation by demonstrating that rewards play a dominant role in scenarios with complex conditions. We hope our findings can contribute to further research into human-centric and reward-centric generation paradigms across the broader field of AIGC.

| **[Harnessing Frequency Spectrum Insights for Image Copyright Protection Against Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11071v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in novel view synthesis, but their reliance on large, diverse, and often untraceable Web datasets has raised pressing concerns about image copyright protection. Current methods fall short in reliably identifying unauthorized image use, as they struggle to generalize across varied generation tasks and fail when the training dataset includes images from multiple sources with few identifiable (watermarked or poisoned) samples. In this paper, we present novel evidence that diffusion-generated images faithfully preserve the statistical properties of their training data, particularly reflected in their spectral features. Leveraging this insight, we introduce \emph{CoprGuard}, a robust frequency domain watermarking framework to safeguard against unauthorized image usage in diffusion model training and fine-tuning. CoprGuard demonstrates remarkable effectiveness against a wide range of models, from naive diffusion models to sophisticated text-to-image models, and is robust even when watermarked images comprise a mere 1\% of the training dataset. This robust and versatile approach empowers content owners to protect their intellectual property in the era of AI-driven image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Recei...</summary><p>Received by CVPR 2025 (10 pages, 11 figures)</p></details> | None |
| **[DreamLayer: Simultaneous Multi-Layer Generation via Diffusion Mode](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12838v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven image generation using diffusion models has recently gained significant attention. To enable more flexible image manipulation and editing, recent research has expanded from single image generation to transparent layer generation and multi-layer compositions. However, existing approaches often fail to provide a thorough exploration of multi-layer structures, leading to inconsistent inter-layer interactions, such as occlusion relationships, spatial layout, and shadowing. In this paper, we introduce DreamLayer, a novel framework that enables coherent text-driven generation of multiple image layers, by explicitly modeling the relationship between transparent foreground and background layers. DreamLayer incorporates three key components, i.e., Context-Aware Cross-Attention (CACA) for global-local information exchange, Layer-Shared Self-Attention (LSSA) for establishing robust inter-layer connections, and Information Retained Harmonization (IRH) for refining fusion details at the latent level. By leveraging a coherent full-image context, DreamLayer builds inter-layer connections through attention mechanisms and applies a harmonization step to achieve seamless layer fusion. To facilitate research in multi-layer generation, we construct a high-quality, diverse multi-layer dataset including 400k samples. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that DreamLayer generates more coherent and well-aligned layers, with broad applicability, including latent-space image editing and image-to-layer decomposition.</p></details> | Under submission | None |
| **[The Silent Assistant: NoiseQuery as Implicit Guidance for Goal-Driven Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05101v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce NoiseQuery as a novel method for enhanced noise initialization in versatile goal-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation. Specifically, we propose to leverage an aligned Gaussian noise as implicit guidance to complement explicit user-defined inputs, such as text prompts, for better generation quality and controllability. Unlike existing noise optimization methods designed for specific models, our approach is grounded in a fundamental examination of the generic finite-step noise scheduler design in diffusion formulation, allowing better generalization across different diffusion-based architectures in a tuning-free manner. This model-agnostic nature allows us to construct a reusable noise library compatible with multiple T2I models and enhancement techniques, serving as a foundational layer for more effective generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NoiseQuery enables fine-grained control and yields significant performance boosts not only over high-level semantics but also over low-level visual attributes, which are typically difficult to specify through text alone, with seamless integration into current workflows with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 18 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[GenStereo: Towards Open-World Generation of Stereo Images and Unsupervised Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12720v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo images are fundamental to numerous applications, including extended reality (XR) devices, autonomous driving, and robotics. Unfortunately, acquiring high-quality stereo images remains challenging due to the precise calibration requirements of dual-camera setups and the complexity of obtaining accurate, dense disparity maps. Existing stereo image generation methods typically focus on either visual quality for viewing or geometric accuracy for matching, but not both. We introduce GenStereo, a diffusion-based approach, to bridge this gap. The method includes two primary innovations (1) conditioning the diffusion process on a disparity-aware coordinate embedding and a warped input image, allowing for more precise stereo alignment than previous methods, and (2) an adaptive fusion mechanism that intelligently combines the diffusion-generated image with a warped image, improving both realism and disparity consistency. Through extensive training on 11 diverse stereo datasets, GenStereo demonstrates strong generalization ability. GenStereo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both stereo image generation and unsupervised stereo matching tasks. Our framework eliminates the need for complex hardware setups while enabling high-quality stereo image generation, making it valuable for both real-world applications and unsupervised learning scenarios.

| **[UniVG: A Generalist Diffusion Model for Unified Image Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12652v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating visually compelling images following user prompts. Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks. However, this requires separate model architectures, training designs, and multiple parameter sets to handle different tasks. In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IQA-Adapter: Exploring Knowledge Transfer from Image Quality Assessment to Diffusion-based Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01794v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based models have recently revolutionized image generation, achieving unprecedented levels of fidelity. However, consistent generation of high-quality images remains challenging partly due to the lack of conditioning mechanisms for perceptual quality. In this work, we propose methods to integrate image quality assessment (IQA) models into diffusion-based generators, enabling quality-aware image generation. We show that diffusion models can learn complex qualitative relationships from both IQA models' outputs and internal activations. First, we experiment with gradient-based guidance to optimize image quality directly and show this method has limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce IQA-Adapter, a novel framework that conditions generation on target quality levels by learning the implicit relationship between images and quality scores. When conditioned on high target quality, IQA-Adapter can shift the distribution of generated images towards a higher-quality subdomain, and, inversely, it can be used as a degradation model, generating progressively more distorted images when provided with a lower-quality signal. Under high-quality condition, IQA-Adapter achieves up to a 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a user preference study, while preserving generative diversity and content. Furthermore, we extend IQA-Adapter to a reference-based conditioning scenario, utilizing the rich activation space of IQA models to transfer highly specific, content-agnostic qualitative features between images.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub repo: https://github.com/X1716/IQA-Adapter</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/X1716/IQA-Adapter) |
| **[Tiled Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15185v4)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image tiling -- the seamless connection of disparate images to create a coherent visual field -- is crucial for applications such as texture creation, video game asset development, and digital art. Traditionally, tiles have been constructed manually, a method that poses significant limitations in scalability and flexibility. Recent research has attempted to automate this process using generative models. However, current approaches primarily focus on tiling textures and manipulating models for single-image generation, without inherently supporting the creation of multiple interconnected tiles across diverse domains. This paper presents Tiled Diffusion, a novel approach that extends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of cohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis that require tiling. Our method supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling to complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple images. Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various applications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture creation, and 360$^\circ$ synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our website for more information and the code: https://madaror.github.io/tiled-diffusion.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://madaror.github.io/tiled-diffusion.github.io) |
| **[Personalize Anything for Free with Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12590v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image generation aims to produce images of user-specified concepts while enabling flexible editing. Recent training-free approaches, while exhibit higher computational efficiency than training-based methods, struggle with identity preservation, applicability, and compatibility with diffusion transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we uncover the untapped potential of DiT, where simply replacing denoising tokens with those of a reference subject achieves zero-shot subject reconstruction. This simple yet effective feature injection technique unlocks diverse scenarios, from personalization to image editing. Building upon this observation, we propose \textbf{Personalize Anything}, a training-free framework that achieves personalized image generation in DiT through: 1) timestep-adaptive token replacement that enforces subject consistency via early-stage injection and enhances flexibility through late-stage regularization, and 2) patch perturbation strategies to boost structural diversity. Our method seamlessly supports layout-guided generation, multi-subject personalization, and mask-controlled editing. Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation and versatility. Our work establishes new insights into DiTs while delivering a practical paradigm for efficient personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://fenghora.github.io/Personalize-Anything-Page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://fenghora.github.io/Personalize-Anything-Page) |
| **[Debiasing Diffusion Model: Enhancing Fairness through Latent Representation Learning in Stable Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12536v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generative models, particularly diffusion-based models, have surged in popularity due to their remarkable ability to synthesize highly realistic images. However, since these models are data-driven, they inherit biases from the training datasets, frequently leading to disproportionate group representations that exacerbate societal inequities. Traditionally, efforts to debiase these models have relied on predefined sensitive attributes, classifiers trained on such attributes, or large language models to steer outputs toward fairness. However, these approaches face notable drawbacks: predefined attributes do not adequately capture complex and continuous variations among groups. To address these issues, we introduce the Debiasing Diffusion Model (DDM), which leverages an indicator to learn latent representations during training, promoting fairness through balanced representations without requiring predefined sensitive attributes. This approach not only demonstrates its effectiveness in scenarios previously addressed by conventional techniques but also enhances fairness without relying on predefined sensitive attributes as conditions. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of prior bias mitigation techniques in diffusion-based models, elaborate on the architecture of the DDM, and validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they exhibit poor performance when confronted with sparse inputs, primarily due to the sparse distribution of Gaussian points and insufficient view supervision. To relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based Gaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC) Regularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs. Specifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by utilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and view-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates limited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency constraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from training views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually overlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across Replica and ScanNet benchmarks. Notably, our SPC-GS achieves a 3.06 dB gain in PSNR for reconstruction quality and a 7.3% improvement in mIoU for open-world semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025.

| **[EditID: Training-Free Editable ID Customization for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12526v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose EditID, a training-free approach based on the DiT architecture, which achieves highly editable customized IDs for text to image generation. Existing text-to-image models for customized IDs typically focus more on ID consistency while neglecting editability. It is challenging to alter facial orientation, character attributes, and other features through prompts. EditID addresses this by deconstructing the text-to-image model for customized IDs into an image generation branch and a character feature branch. The character feature branch is further decoupled into three modules: feature extraction, feature fusion, and feature integration. By introducing a combination of mapping features and shift features, along with controlling the intensity of ID feature integration, EditID achieves semantic compression of local features across network depths, forming an editable feature space. This enables the successful generation of high-quality images with editable IDs while maintaining ID consistency, achieving excellent results in the IBench evaluation, which is an editability evaluation framework for the field of customized ID text-to-image generation that quantitatively demonstrates the superior performance of EditID. EditID is the first text-to-image solution to propose customizable ID editability on the DiT architecture, meeting the demands of long prompts and high quality image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tell Me What You See: Text-Guided Real-World Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10191v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image reconstruction from noisy sensor measurements is challenging and many methods have been proposed for it. Yet, most approaches focus on learning robust natural image priors while modeling the scene's noise statistics. In extremely low-light conditions, these methods often remain insufficient. Additional information is needed, such as multiple captures or, as suggested here, scene description. As an alternative, we propose using a text-based description of the scene as an additional prior, something the photographer can easily provide. Inspired by the remarkable success of text-guided diffusion models in image generation, we show that adding image caption information significantly improves image denoising and reconstruction for both synthetic and real-world images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LazyMAR: Accelerating Masked Autoregressive Models via Feature Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12450v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models have emerged as a promising approach in image generation, expected to surpass traditional autoregressive models in computational efficiency by leveraging the capability of parallel decoding. However, their dependence on bidirectional self-attention inherently conflicts with conventional KV caching mechanisms, creating unexpected computational bottlenecks that undermine their expected efficiency. To address this problem, this paper studies the caching mechanism for MAR by leveraging two types of redundancy: Token Redundancy indicates that a large portion of tokens have very similar representations in the adjacent decoding steps, which allows us to first cache them in previous steps and then reuse them in the later steps. Condition Redundancy indicates that the difference between conditional and unconditional output in classifier-free guidance exhibits very similar values in adjacent steps. Based on these two redundancies, we propose LazyMAR, which introduces two caching mechanisms to handle them one by one. LazyMAR is training-free and plug-and-play for all MAR models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 2.83 times acceleration with almost no drop in generation quality. Our codes will be released in https://github.com/feihongyan1/LazyMAR.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/feihongyan1/LazyMAR) |
| **[Glauber Generative Model: Discrete Diffusion Models via Binary Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17035v4)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Glauber Generative Model (GGM), a new class of discrete diffusion models, to obtain new samples from a distribution given samples from a discrete space. GGM deploys a discrete Markov chain called the heat bath dynamics (or the Glauber dynamics) to denoise a sequence of noisy tokens to a sample from a joint distribution of discrete tokens. Our novel conceptual framework provides an exact reduction of the task of learning the denoising Markov chain to solving a class of binary classification tasks. More specifically, the model learns to classify a given token in a noisy sequence as signal or noise. In contrast, prior works on discrete diffusion models either solve regression problems to learn importance ratios, or minimize loss functions given by variational approximations. We apply GGM to language modeling and image generation, where images are discretized using image tokenizers like VQGANs. We show that it outperforms existing discrete diffusion models in language generation, and demonstrates strong performance for image generation without using dataset-specific image tokenizers. We also show that our model is capable of performing well in zero-shot control settings like text and image infilling.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |
| **[Localized Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using Training-Free Gated Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12356v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

While effective, this approach is computationally expensive, leading to growing interest in inference-time scaling to improve performance. Currently, inference-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models is largely limited to best-of-N sampling, where multiple images are generated per prompt and a selection model chooses the best output. Inspired by the recent success of reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 in the language domain, we introduce an alternative to naive best-of-N sampling by equipping text-to-image Diffusion Transformers with in-context reflection capabilities. We propose Reflect-DiT, a method that enables Diffusion Transformers to refine their generations using in-context examples of previously generated images alongside textual feedback describing necessary improvements. Instead of passively relying on random sampling and hoping for a better result in a future generation, Reflect-DiT explicitly tailors its generations to address specific aspects requiring enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that Reflect-DiT improves performance on the GenEval benchmark (+0.19) using SANA-1.0-1.6B as a base model. Additionally, it achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 0.81 on GenEval while generating only 20 samples per prompt, surpassing the previous best score of 0.80, which was obtained using a significantly larger model (SANA-1.5-4.8B) with 2048 samples under the best-of-N approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures | None |

Such a task is exciting to many downstream applications because the input layouts offer strong guidance to the generation process while remaining easily reconfigurable by humans. In this paper, we proposed STyled LAYout Diffusion (STAY Diffusion), a diffusion-based model that produces photo-realistic images and provides fine-grained control of stylized objects in scenes. Our approach learns a global condition for each layout, and a self-supervised semantic map for weight modulation using a novel Edge-Aware Normalization (EA Norm). A new Styled-Mask Attention (SM Attention) is also introduced to cross-condition the global condition and image feature for capturing the objects' relationships. These measures provide consistent guidance through the model, enabling more accurate and controllable image generation. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that our STAY Diffusion presents high-quality images while surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods in generation diversity, accuracy, and controllability.</p></details> | Accepted by WACV2025 | None |
| **[Generative AI in Agriculture: Creating Image Datasets Using DALL.E's Advanced Large Language Model Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08789v5)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research investigated the role of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically the DALL.E model by OpenAI, in advancing data generation and visualization techniques in agriculture. DALL.E, an advanced AI image generator, works alongside ChatGPT's language processing to transform text descriptions and image clues into realistic visual representations of the content. The study used both approaches of image generation: text-to-image and image-to-image (variation). Six types of datasets depicting fruit crop environment were generated. These AI-generated images were then compared against ground truth images captured by sensors in real agricultural fields. The comparison was based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Feature Similarity Index (FSIM) metrics. The image-to-image generation exhibited a 5.78% increase in average PSNR over text-to-image methods, signifying superior image clarity and quality. However, this method also resulted in a 10.23% decrease in average FSIM, indicating a diminished structural and textural similarity to the original images. Similar to these measures, human evaluation also showed that images generated using image-to-image-based method were more realistic compared to those generated with text-to-image approach. The results highlighted DALL.E's potential in generating realistic agricultural image datasets and thus accelerating the development and adoption of imaging-based precision agricultural solutions. In future, DALL.E along with other alternative LLM based image generation models such as MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, Craiyon, Imagen, Parti, DreamStudio, Make-A-Scene, DeepDream, and VQ-GAN + CLIP could demonstrate further significant potential for enhancing image clarity, quality, and realism in depicting agricultural environments, which could revolutionize precision farming practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Fig...</summary><p>9 Figures, 1 table, 19 pages</p></details> | None |
| **[FAILS: A Framework for Automated Collection and Analysis of LLM Service Incidents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12185v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) services such as ChatGPT, DALLE, and Cursor have quickly become essential for society, businesses, and individuals, empowering applications such as chatbots, image generation, and code assistance. The complexity of LLM systems makes them prone to failures and affects their reliability and availability, yet their failure patterns are not fully understood, making it an emerging problem. However, there are limited datasets and studies in this area, particularly lacking an open-access tool for analyzing LLM service failures based on incident reports. Addressing these problems, in this work we propose FAILS, the first open-sourced framework for incident reports collection and analysis on different LLM services and providers. FAILS provides comprehensive data collection, analysis, and visualization capabilities, including:(1) It can automatically collect, clean, and update incident data through its data scraper and processing components;(2) It provides 17 types of failure analysis, allowing users to explore temporal trends of incidents, analyze service reliability metrics, such as Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF);(3) It leverages advanced LLM tools to assist in data analysis and interpretation, enabling users to gain observations and insights efficiently. All functions are integrated in the backend, allowing users to easily access them through a web-based frontend interface. FAILS supports researchers, engineers, and general users to understand failure patterns and further mitigate operational incidents and outages in LLM services. The framework is publicly available on https://github.com/atlarge-research/FAILS.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/atlarge-research/FAILS) |
| **[LAPIG: Language Guided Projector Image Generation with Surface Adaptation and Stylization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12173v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LAPIG, a language guided projector image generation method with surface adaptation and stylization. LAPIG consists of a projector-camera system and a target textured projection surface. LAPIG takes the user text prompt as input and aims to transform the surface style using the projector. LAPIG's key challenge is that due to the projector's physical brightness limitation and the surface texture, the viewer's perceived projection may suffer from color saturation and artifacts in both dark and bright regions, such that even with the state-of-the-art projector compensation techniques, the viewer may see clear surface texture-related artifacts. Therefore, how to generate a projector image that follows the user's instruction while also displaying minimum surface artifacts is an open problem. To address this issue, we propose projection surface adaptation (PSA) that can generate compensable surface stylization. We first train two networks to simulate the projector compensation and project-and-capture processes, this allows us to find a satisfactory projector image without real project-and-capture and utilize gradient descent for fast convergence. Then, we design content and saturation losses to guide the projector image generation, such that the generated image shows no clearly perceivable artifacts when projected. Finally, the generated image is projected for visually pleasing surface style morphing effects. The source code and video are available on the project page: https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG/.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | [Code Link](https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG) |
