| **[HadaNorm: Diffusion Transformer Quantization through Mean-Centered Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09932v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches by both normalizing channels activations and applying Hadamard transforms to effectively mitigate outliers and enable aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 6 Figures | None |

However, the underlying computational redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and has been publicly released.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR) |

Unlike existing methods that focus on isolated parts of 3D hair modeling and involve a heavy computation process or network training, Digital Salon offers a holistic and interactive system that lowers the technical barriers of 3D hair modeling through natural language-based interaction. The system guides users through four key stages: text-guided hair retrieval, real-time hair simulation, interactive hair refinement, and hair-conditioned image generation. This cohesive workflow makes advanced hair design accessible to users of varying skill levels and dramatically streamlines the creative process in digital media with an intuitive, versatile, and efficient solution for hair modeling. User studies show that our system can outperform traditional hair modeling workflows for rapid prototyping. Furthermore, we provide insights into the benefits of our system with future potential of deploying our system in real salon environments.

| **[Localized Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using Training-Free Gated Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12356v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Scale leads to compositional generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07207v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds across different task encodings as long as the training distribution sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/smonsays/scale-compositionality</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/smonsays/scale-compositionality) |
| **[Interpretable EEG-to-Image Generation with Semantic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07157v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes -- generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference, caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Actio...</summary><p>Actionable Interpretability Workshop (non-archival) at the 42 International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> | None |
| **[Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However, their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning (MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

| **[Evaluating Attribute Confusion in Fashion Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07079v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However, our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e., when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized (leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIAP25.

| **[Hallucinating 360°: Panoramic Street-View Generation via Local Scenes Diffusion and Probabilistic Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06971v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models.

| **[DynamicID: Zero-Shot Multi-ID Image Personalization with Flexible Facial Editability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06505v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have spurred interest in personalized human image generation, which aims to create novel images featuring specific human identities as reference images indicate. Although existing methods achieve high-fidelity identity preservation, they often struggle with limited multi-ID usability and inadequate facial editability. We present DynamicID, a tuning-free framework supported by a dual-stage training paradigm that inherently facilitates both single-ID and multi-ID personalized generation with high fidelity and flexible facial editability. Our key innovations include: 1) Semantic-Activated Attention (SAA), which employs query-level activation gating to minimize disruption to the original model when injecting ID features and achieve multi-ID personalization without requiring multi-ID samples during training. 2) Identity-Motion Reconfigurator (IMR), which leverages contrastive learning to effectively disentangle and re-entangle facial motion and identity features, thereby enabling flexible facial editing. Additionally, we have developed a curated VariFace-10k facial dataset, comprising 10k unique individuals, each represented by 35 distinct facial images. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, facial editability, and multi-ID personalization capability.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |
| **[Concept-TRAK: Understanding how diffusion models learn concepts through concept-level attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06547v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency. Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called \emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.</p></details> | Preprint | None |
| **[Concept Unlearning by Modeling Key Steps of Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06526v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion, which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU) method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally, KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's generative capabilities.Our code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

X-ray image segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems, yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image. To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.</p></details> | 4 pages | None |

FL is particularly beneficial for distributed training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of the total computation and communication resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables.

| **[StreamDiffusion: A Pipeline-level Solution for Real-time Interactive Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12491v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce StreamDiffusion, a real-time diffusion pipeline designed for interactive image generation. Existing diffusion models are adept at creating images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process. Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG), which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG) algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around 1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one RTX4090, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>tech ...</summary><p>tech report, the code is available at https://github.com/cumulo-autumn/StreamDiffusion</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/cumulo-autumn/StreamDiffusion) |

While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG. NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG. Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably, NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures | None |
| **[TDRI: Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation for Interactive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17669v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although text-to-image generation technologies have made significant advancements, they still face challenges when dealing with ambiguous prompts and aligning outputs with user intent.Our proposed framework, TDRI (Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation), addresses these issues by enhancing image generation through iterative user interaction. It consists of two phases: the Initial Generation Phase, which creates base images based on user prompts, and the Interactive Refinement Phase, which integrates user feedback through three key modules. The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user feedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the alignment between user intent and model input. By evaluating generated outputs against user expectations, the Feedback-Reflection (FR) module identifies discrepancies and facilitates improvements. In an effort to ensure consistently high-quality results, the Adaptive Optimization (AO) module fine-tunes the generation process by balancing user preferences and maintaining prompt fidelity. Experimental results show that TDRI outperforms existing methods by achieving 33.6% human preference, compared to 6.2% for GPT-4 augmentation, and the highest CLIP and BLIP alignment scores (0.338 and 0.336, respectively). In iterative feedback tasks, user satisfaction increased to 88% after 8 rounds, with diminishing returns beyond 6 rounds. Furthermore, TDRI has been found to reduce the number of iterations and improve personalization in the creation of fashion products. TDRI exhibits a strong potential for a wide range of applications in the creative and industrial domains, as it streamlines the creative process and improves alignment with user preferences</p></details> |  | None |

In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we introduce UniCombine, a DiT-based multi-conditional controllable generative framework capable of handling any combination of conditions, including but not limited to text prompts, spatial maps, and subject images. Specifically, we introduce a novel Conditional MMDiT Attention mechanism and incorporate a trainable LoRA module to build both the training-free and training-based versions. Additionally, we propose a new pipeline to construct SubjectSpatial200K, the first dataset designed for multi-conditional generative tasks covering both the subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditions.

Moreover, because most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, global information is limited. To address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Hita incorporates two key strategies to better align with the AR generation process: 1) {arranging} a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning, followed by patch-level tokens, and using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) adopting a lightweight fusion module before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder to control information flow and prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID} and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. Detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties, such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Although many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework.

Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios. In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction, instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval with high success rates.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AdaptaGen: Domain-Specific Image Generation through Hierarchical Semantic Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05621v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity. However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately, overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis, resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40 categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category, demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and semantic consistency.</p></details> |  | None |

A challenge, however, is the effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser, holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance. Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 7 Figures | None |
| **[SingLoRA: Low Rank Adaptation Using a Single Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05566v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization, and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+ (90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation, fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we propose BayesGenie, an off-the-shelf approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization to facilitate precise and user-friendly image editing. Our method enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions without manual area marking, while preserving the original image's semantic integrity. Unlike existing techniques that require extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, our approach demonstrates remarkable adaptability across various LLMs through its model-agnostic design. BayesGenie employs an adapted Bayesian optimization strategy to automatically refine the inference process parameters, achieving high-precision image editing with minimal user intervention. Through extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in both editing accuracy and semantic preservation, as validated using different LLMs including Claude3 and GPT-4.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 fig...</summary><p>8 figures, accept at ACL2025 Findings</p></details> | None |

Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes. For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just 15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.</p></details> |  | None |

The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare it to classic, white noise diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 21 figures.

The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details, while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning, with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated, supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Current image conditioning methods either introduce substantial parameter overhead or handle only specific control tasks effectively, limiting their practical versatility. OminiControl addresses these limitations through three key innovations: (1) a minimal architectural design that leverages the DiT's own VAE encoder and transformer blocks, requiring just 0.1% additional parameters; (2) a unified sequence processing strategy that combines condition tokens with image tokens for flexible token interactions; and (3) a dynamic position encoding mechanism that adapts to both spatially-aligned and non-aligned control tasks. Our extensive experiments show that this streamlined approach not only matches but surpasses the performance of specialized methods across multiple conditioning tasks. To overcome data limitations in subject-driven generation, we also introduce Subjects200K, a large-scale dataset of identity-consistent image pairs synthesized using DiT models themselves. This work demonstrates that effective image control can be achieved without architectural complexity, opening new possibilities for efficient and versatile image generation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis.

However, these developments also raise significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response, training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference, exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at https://github.com/Chrisqcwx/ImageAR-MIA.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/Chrisqcwx/ImageAR-MIA) |

One potential solution is to generate synthetic images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy. However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to 78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations, enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and facilitating medical diagnosis and research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks across all evaluated metrics. The data generation (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are available online.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) |

However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 12 figures | None |

Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Unlike the traditional approaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess the damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify post-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised learning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating images is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise. This work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify flooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two encoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual features learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study investigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial images. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2 model, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the distinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that DINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable, general-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial segmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we significantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes, enabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.</p></details> | 13 Pages, 4 Figures | None |

A common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments. Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are sufficiently dissimilar.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures | None |

Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation, cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that reflect transcriptomic perturbations.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite these advancements, existing methods have not explored the simulation of future scenarios based on given scenario images. This simulation capability has wide applications for urban planning, land managementChangeBridge: Spatiotemporal Image Generation with Multimodal Controls, and beyond. In this work, we propose ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts, instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion, directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven background variations.

However, this reliance introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than established user-turn jailbreaking methods.

These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems.

We present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema \textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\% enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text generation tasks.

| **[A Training-Free Style-Personalization via Scale-wise Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04482v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation that controls content and style information during inference using a scale-wise autoregressive model. Our method employs a three-path design--content, style, and generation--each guided by a corresponding text prompt, enabling flexible and efficient control over image semantics without any additional training. A central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both content and style, and that query features predominantly encode content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[DreamVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model Dreamed with Comprehensive World Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04447v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

The recent development of diffusion transformer (DiT) has witnessed overwhelming performance over the traditional UNet-based architecture in image generation, which also raises the question: Can we adopt the advanced DiT-based diffusion model for Real-ISR? To this end, we propose our DiT4SR, one of the pioneering works to tame the large-scale DiT model for Real-ISR. Instead of directly injecting embeddings extracted from low-resolution (LR) images like ControlNet, we integrate the LR embeddings into the original attention mechanism of DiT, allowing for the bidirectional flow of information between the LR latent and the generated latent. The sufficient interaction of these two streams allows the LR stream to evolve with the diffusion process, producing progressively refined guidance that better aligns with the generated latent at each diffusion step. Additionally, the LR guidance is injected into the generated latent via a cross-stream convolution layer, compensating for DiT's limited ability to capture local information. These simple but effective designs endow the DiT model with superior performance in Real-ISR, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments.

| **[SeqTex: Generate Mesh Textures in Video Sequence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04285v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors. However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper, we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain. To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, DreamPoster is built upon our T2I model, Seedream3.0 to uniformly process different poster generating types. For dataset construction, we propose a systematic data annotation pipeline that precisely annotates textual content and typographic hierarchy information within poster images, while employing comprehensive methodologies to construct paired datasets comprising source materials (e.g., raw graphics/text) and their corresponding final poster outputs. Additionally, we implement a progressive training strategy that enables the model to hierarchically acquire multi-task generation capabilities while maintaining high-quality generation. Evaluations on our testing benchmarks demonstrate DreamPoster's superiority over existing methods, achieving a high usability rate of 88.55\%, compared to GPT-4o (47.56\%) and SeedEdit3.0 (25.96\%).

| **[Quick Bypass Mechanism of Zero-Shot Diffusion-Based Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04207v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks. Building upon these achievements, diffusion models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning, these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM), a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these advancements also introduce an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence public opinion and spread propaganda. In this paper, we study an attack vector that allows an adversary to inject arbitrary bias into a target model. The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted set of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious data samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick common sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign users during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such attacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial process both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various aspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's utility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive experiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment, highlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that bias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier (\$10-\$15) to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to USENIX Security '25</p></details> | None |

However, this "share-and-play" ecosystem introduces critical risks: benign LoRAs can be weaponized by adversaries to generate harmful content (e.g., political, defamatory imagery), undermining creator rights and platform safety. Existing defenses like concept-erasure methods focus on full diffusion models (DMs), neglecting LoRA's unique role as a modular adapter and its vulnerability to adversarial prompt engineering. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRAShield, the first data-free editing framework for securing LoRA models against misuse. Our platform-driven approach dynamically edits and realigns LoRA's weight subspace via adversarial optimization and semantic augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that LoRAShield achieves remarkable effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness in blocking malicious generations without sacrificing the functionality of the benign task. By shifting the defense to platforms, LoRAShield enables secure, scalable sharing of personalized models, a critical step toward trustworthy generative ecosystems.</p></details> |  | None |

We demonstrate our approach with a Web application that organizes data into a structured format using interactive mind maps and image generation tools. The system is implemented using the TED-LIUM~3 dataset, which comprises over 2,000 speech transcripts and audio files of TED Talks. Initial user tests using a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire indicate the application's potential to simplify the exploration of large speech collections.</p></details> |  | None |

While current LVLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in text-to-image generation, they often falter when confronted with complex textual descriptions demanding precise compositional understanding and visual planning. This limitation particularly impacts the accurate rendering of multiple objects, their attributes, spatial relationships, and specific poses within intricate scenes, as evidenced by benchmarks like LongBench-T2I. To address these challenges, we introduce LVLM-Composer, a novel 10-billion parameter scale LVLM specifically engineered for enhanced compositional image synthesis. Our method incorporates a Hierarchical Semantic Planning Module for structured prompt decomposition and a Fine-Grained Feature Alignment Mechanism for precise visual guidance during generation. We propose a multi-stage training paradigm, featuring Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Grounding Pre-training and Compositional Planning Reinforcement Learning with Self-Correction, to instill robust compositional reasoning. Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I benchmark, utilizing automatic evaluation by Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate LVLM-Composer's superior performance across critical compositional dimensions including object accuracy, composition fidelity, and pose accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. An in-depth ablation study further validates the indispensable contribution of our proposed modules, while human evaluations confirm the perceptual superiority of our generated images. LVLM-Composer represents a significant step towards truly controllable and compositionally accurate open-ended text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired image-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual attributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these limitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The first stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align hierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal semantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The second stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this acquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where the LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image generation process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for precise output alignment. Comprehensive experiments against leading baselines, including Janus-Pro-1B, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, DeepFloyd IF v1.0, and ControlNet-XL, on multi-dimensional benchmarks such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate Hi-SSLVLM's superior performance across all fine-grained metrics. An in-depth ablation study confirms the critical role of each proposed component. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate our quantitative findings, highlighting Hi-SSLVLM's enhanced fidelity to prompt, compositional accuracy, and overall aesthetic quality, marking a significant step towards more controllable and semantically consistent open-ended text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, TTI models are trained to always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate what we call "default images": images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. We argue studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for TTI and prompt engineering. In this paper, we provide the first investigation into default images on Midjourney, a popular image generator. We describe our systematic approach to create input prompts triggering default images, and present the results of our initial experiments and several small-scale ablation studies. We also report on a survey study investigating how default images affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI and highlights challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, the small network capacity of previous methods and limited multi-species dataset leave this problem underexplored. To this end, this paper presents AniMer to estimate animal pose and shape using family aware Transformer, enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of diverse quadrupedal families. A key insight of AniMer is its integration of a high-capacity Transformer-based backbone and an animal family supervised contrastive learning scheme, unifying the discriminative understanding of various quadrupedal shapes within a single framework. For effective training, we aggregate most available open-sourced quadrupedal datasets, either with 3D or 2D labels. To improve the diversity of 3D labeled data, we introduce CtrlAni3D, a novel large-scale synthetic dataset created through a new diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. CtrlAni3D consists of about 10k images with pixel-aligned SMAL labels. In total, we obtain 41.3k annotated images for training and validation. Consequently, the combination of a family aware Transformer network and an expansive dataset enables AniMer to outperform existing methods not only on 3D datasets like Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, but also on out-of-distribution Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of our network design and CtrlAni3D in enhancing the performance of AniMer for in-the-wild applications.

This has limited their adoption and use to research laboratories and companies with large resources, while significantly raising the carbon footprint for training, fine-tuning, and inference. In this work, we present a novel GAN architecture which we call LadaGAN. This architecture is based on a linear attention Transformer block named Ladaformer. The main component of this block is a linear additive-attention mechanism that computes a single attention vector per head instead of the quadratic dot-product attention. We employ Ladaformer in both the generator and discriminator, which reduces the computational complexity and overcomes the training instabilities often associated with Transformer GANs. LadaGAN consistently outperforms existing convolutional and Transformer GANs on benchmark datasets at different resolutions while being significantly more efficient. Moreover, LadaGAN shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multi-step generative models (e.g. DMs) using orders of magnitude less computational resources.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures | None |

However, it remains unclear how this interpretability can be systematically leveraged to guide model design, improve generative quality, and reduce training time. Moreover, the reliance on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling presents challenges in efficiency and exploring multimodal latent distributions. In this work, we propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for generative modeling and introduce the Thermodynamic Kolmogorov-Arnold Model (T-KAM) as a new framework for incorporating structural and inductive biases. By constraining the prior to univariate relationships, T-KAM enables fast and exact inference via the inverse transform method. We also introduce a training strategy based on population-based LMC, which decomposes posterior sampling into a sequence of annealed distributions to improve multimodal exploration. We empirically demonstrate how inductive biases enable more efficient training strategies and compare our novel approaches to scaling and prior sampling. T-KAM provides an elegant balance among common trade-offs in generative modeling, offering fast inference, high sample quality, and stable training, while being naturally suited to upcoming Zettascale Computing Co. hardware and extendable to other high-impact research directions in generative intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we introduce a diffusion model architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability. Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the generated image by producing explanations that highlight the pixel regions influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into prompt-image alignment.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures | None |

A notable drawback of CLIP, however, is that the resulting embedding space seems to lack some of the structure of its purely text-based alternatives. For instance, while text embeddings have long been noted to satisfy analogies in embedding space using vector arithmetic, CLIP has no such property. In this paper, we propose an approach to natively train CLIP in a contrastive manner to reason about differences in embedding space. We finetune CLIP so that text descriptions of differences between images correspond to their difference in image embedding space, using synthetically generated data with large language models on image-caption paired datasets. We first demonstrate that our approach yields significantly improved capabilities in ranking images by a certain attribute (e.g., elephants are larger than cats), which is useful in retrieval or constructing attribute-based classifiers, and improved zeroshot classification performance on many downstream image classification tasks. In addition, our approach enables a new mechanism for inference that we refer to as comparative prompting, where we leverage prior knowledge of text descriptions of differences between classes of interest, achieving even larger performance gains in classification. Finally, we illustrate that the resulting embeddings obey a larger degree of geometric properties in embedding space, such as in text-to-image generation.</p></details> | 30 pages | None |

However, the robustness of current watermarking techniques is still largely unexplored, raising critical questions about their effectiveness against adversarial attacks. To address this gap, we examine the robustness of model-specific watermarking, where watermark embedding is integrated with text-to-image generation in models like latent diffusion models. We introduce three attack strategies: edge prediction-based, box blurring, and fine-tuning-based attacks in a no-box setting, where an attacker does not require access to the ground-truth watermark decoder. Our findings reveal that while model-specific watermarking is resilient against basic evasion attempts, such as edge prediction, it is notably vulnerable to blurring and fine-tuning-based attacks. Our best-performing attack achieves a reduction in watermark detection accuracy to approximately 47.92\%. Additionally, we perform an ablation study on factors like message length, kernel size and decoder depth, identifying critical parameters influencing the fine-tuning attack's success. Finally, we assess several advanced watermarking defenses, finding that even the most robust methods, such as multi-label smoothing, result in watermark extraction accuracy that falls below an acceptable level when subjected to our no-box attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02035</p></details> | None |

However, commercial design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more. In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality. Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input, MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) - structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

While VLFMs show a rich understanding of semantic content across modalities, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment tasks that require precise correspondence between image regions and textual descriptions, a limitation in medical imaging, where accurate localization and detection of clinical features are essential for diagnosis and analysis. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage architecture where a pre-trained VLFM (e.g. Stable Diffusion) provides a cursory semantic understanding, while a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm refines the alignment through an iterative process that optimizes for understanding semantic context. The reward signal is designed to align the semantic information of the text with synthesized images. Experiments on the public ISIC2019 skin lesion dataset demonstrate that the proposed method improves (a) the quality of the generated images, and (b) the alignment with the text prompt over the original fine-tuned Stable Diffusion baseline. We also show that the synthesized samples could be used to improve disease classifier performance for underrepresented subgroups through augmentation.

However, these tools often overlook the intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG) renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a minimum-time smoothing criterion.

| **[LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover, it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent embeddings for generated image detection.

Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training. To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly. Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image generation under different scenarios.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

Moreover, it is difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets. First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, optimizing these circuits remains challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints. While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner into practical applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 12 figures | None |

However, their generalization to real-world scenarios remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated real-world stereo data. In this paper, we propose ZeroStereo, a novel stereo image generation pipeline for zero-shot stereo matching. Our approach synthesizes high-quality right images from arbitrary single images by leveraging pseudo disparities generated by a monocular depth estimation model. Unlike previous methods that address occluded regions by filling missing areas with neighboring pixels or random backgrounds, we fine-tune a diffusion inpainting model to recover missing details while preserving semantic structure. Additionally, we propose Training-Free Confidence Generation, which mitigates the impact of unreliable pseudo labels without additional training, and Adaptive Disparity Selection, which ensures a diverse and realistic disparity distribution while preventing excessive occlusion and foreground distortion. Experiments demonstrate that models trained with our pipeline achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets with only a dataset volume comparable to Scene Flow.

Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID} and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Existing methods attempt to address this by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and consistent visual stories.

Although such models can generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our ODE$_t$(ODE$_l$) approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to 3$\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to 3.5 points for high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully reproducible experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Traditional autoregressive image generation relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2) Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256 to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized autoregressive models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> | None |

Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches typically fine-tune pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization, as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject fidelity and prompt consistency.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data. In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e., Infographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG. We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set. Additionally, we conduct thorough ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component. We hope our constructed Infographics-650K and BizEval can encourage the broader community to advance the progress of business content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://weizhi-zhong.github.io/Mod-Adapter</p></details> | [Code Link](https://weizhi-zhong.github.io/Mod-Adapter) |

However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than 1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial understanding needed for high-quality generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Representation Entanglement for Generation:Training Diffusion Transformers Is Much Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01467v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models, through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\% increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively, SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer).

While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF) module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention. To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.

Existing methods often rely on pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks -- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark, significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks: GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong generalization and deployment readiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, these advancements also introduce an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence public opinion and spread propaganda. In this paper, we study an attack vector that allows an adversary to inject arbitrary bias into a target model. The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted set of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious data samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick common sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign users during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such attacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial process both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various aspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's utility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive experiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment, highlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that bias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier ($10-$15) to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to USENIX Security '25</p></details> | None |

Among them, Stable Diffusion (StableDiff) stands out as a key model for text-to-image generation and a foundation for next-generation multi-modal algorithms. However, its high computational and memory demands hinder inference speed and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we identify three core issues: (1) intensive and often redundant computations, (2) heterogeneous operations involving convolutions and attention mechanisms, and (3) diverse weight and activation sizes. We present SD-Acc, a novel algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework. At the algorithm level, we observe that high-level features in certain denoising phases show significant similarity, enabling approximate computation. Leveraging this, we propose an adaptive, phase-aware sampling strategy that reduces compute and memory loads. This framework automatically balances image quality and complexity based on the StableDiff model and user requirements. At the hardware level, we design an address-centric dataflow to efficiently handle heterogeneous operations within a simple systolic array. We address the bottleneck of nonlinear functions via a two-stage streaming architecture and a reconfigurable vector processing unit. Additionally, we implement adaptive dataflow optimizations by combining dynamic reuse and operator fusion tailored to StableDiff workloads, significantly reducing memory access. Across multiple StableDiff models, our method achieves up to a 3x reduction in computational demand without compromising image quality. Combined with our optimized hardware accelerator, SD-Acc delivers higher speed and energy efficiency than traditional CPU and GPU implementations.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1$.$dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity, restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach. TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency.

| **[BEV-VAE: Multi-view Image Generation with Spatial Consistency for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00707v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view image generation in autonomous driving demands consistent 3D scene understanding across camera views. Most existing methods treat this problem as a 2D image set generation task, lacking explicit 3D modeling. However, we argue that a structured representation is crucial for scene generation, especially for autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes BEV-VAE for consistent and controllable view synthesis. BEV-VAE first trains a multi-view image variational autoencoder for a compact and unified BEV latent space and then generates the scene with a latent diffusion transformer. BEV-VAE supports arbitrary view generation given camera configurations, and optionally 3D layouts. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 (AV2) show strong performance in both 3D consistent reconstruction and generation.

| **[Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/qhfan/MALA) |

However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, 3rd Word Congress on Artificial Intelligence in Materials & Manufacturing 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[MedDiff-FT: Data-Efficient Diffusion Model Fine-tuning with Structural Guidance for Controllable Medical Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00377v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning for medical image segmentation are often limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data.While diffusion models provide a potential solution by generating synthetic images, their effectiveness in medical imaging remains constrained due to their reliance on large-scale medical datasets and the need for higher image quality. To address these challenges, we present MedDiff-FT, a controllable medical image generation method that fine-tunes a diffusion foundation model to produce medical images with structural dependency and domain specificity in a data-efficient manner. During inference, a dynamic adaptive guiding mask enforces spatial constraints to ensure anatomically coherent synthesis, while a lightweight stochastic mask generator enhances diversity through hierarchical randomness injection. Additionally, an automated quality assessment protocol filters suboptimal outputs using feature-space metrics, followed by mask corrosion to refine fidelity. Evaluated on five medical segmentation datasets,MedDiff-FT's synthetic image-mask pairs improve SOTA method's segmentation performance by an average of 1% in Dice score. The framework effectively balances generation quality, diversity, and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for medical data augmentation.

| **[Efficient Depth- and Spatially-Varying Image Simulation for Defocus Deblur](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00372v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cameras with large apertures often suffer from a shallow depth of field, resulting in blurry images of objects outside the focal plane. This limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Generalized and Training-Free Text-Guided Semantic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17269v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided semantic manipulation refers to semantically editing an image generated from a source prompt to match a target prompt, enabling the desired semantic changes (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) while preserving irrelevant contents. With the powerful generative capabilities of the diffusion model, the task has shown the potential to generate high-fidelity visual content. Nevertheless, existing methods either typically require time-consuming fine-tuning (inefficient), fail to accomplish multiple semantic manipulations (poorly extensible), and/or lack support for different modality tasks (limited generalizability). Upon further investigation, we find that the geometric properties of noises in the diffusion model are strongly correlated with the semantic changes. Motivated by this, we propose a novel $\textit{GTF}$ for text-guided semantic manipulation, which has the following attractive capabilities: 1) $\textbf{Generalized}$: our $\textit{GTF}$ supports multiple semantic manipulations (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) and can be seamlessly integrated into all diffusion-based methods (i.e., Plug-and-play) across different modalities (i.e., modality-agnostic); and 2) $\textbf{Training-free}$: $\textit{GTF}$ produces high-fidelity results via simply controlling the geometric relationship between noises without tuning or optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, highlighting its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in semantics manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ayanami-yu.github.io/GTF-Project-Page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ayanami-yu.github.io/GTF-Project-Page) |

However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1 incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves 4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively.

In the context of brain MRIs, existing CA approaches rely on supervised contrastive learning or variational autoencoders (VAEs) using both healthy and unhealthy data, but such reliance on target samples is challenging in clinical settings. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) offers an alternative by learning a reference representation of healthy anatomy without the need for target samples. Deviations from this reference distribution can indicate potential anomalies. In this context, diffusion models have been increasingly adopted in UAD due to their superior performance in image generation compared to VAEs. Nonetheless, precisely reconstructing the anatomy of the brain remains a challenge. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework to improve the reconstruction quality by training a self-supervised contrastive encoder on healthy images to extract meaningful anatomical features. These features are used to condition a diffusion model to reconstruct the healthy appearance of a given image, enabling interpretable anomaly localization via pixel-wise comparison. We validate our approach through a proof-of-concept on a facial image dataset and further demonstrate its effectiveness on four brain MRI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art anomaly localization performance on the NOVA benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> | None |

Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications. We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360 enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for 2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets, enabling customizable 3D content creation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Towards 3D Semantic Image Synthesis for Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00206v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets is challenging due to both accessibility issues and stringent privacy regulations. Consequently, data availability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine learning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM (Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and leverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of privacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that focus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D semantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full volumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D image generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space of a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model significantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical 3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic medical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional Duke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images (0.71496). These results demonstrate that the synthetic data from our model have a small domain gap with real data and are useful for data augmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

For instance, generating an image of skin lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis, such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic, colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover, to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts) into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving 100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios: each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome. These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> | None |

Instead of a single patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow (PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow, our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$) inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance. Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with small training time.

While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views. Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

Transformer combined with diffusion models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless, existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details. To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT) is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 11pages, 11 figures | None |

However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment, and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei segmentation and classification.

Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale, which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation. Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance, offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://annealing-guidance.github.io/annealing-guidance/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://annealing-guidance.github.io/annealing-guidance) |

However, in practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space. In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of image generative models to augment human creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is available at https://imagineforme.github.io/</p></details> | None |

We propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained multimodal image-generation model as a world model to guide policy learning. By exploiting its rich visual-semantic representations and strong generalization across diverse scenes, the model generates open-ended future state predictions that inform downstream manipulation. Coupled with zero-shot low-level control modules, our approach enables general-purpose robotic manipulation without task-specific training.

Existing methods focus on the integration of diverse generative information into controlling inputs, utilizing frameworks such as GLIGEN or ControlNet, to produce commendable outcomes in controllable generation. However, such approaches intrinsically restrict generation performance to the learning capacities of predefined network architectures. In this paper, we explore the innovative integration of controlling information and introduce PerLDiff (\textbf{Per}spective-\textbf{L}ayout \textbf{Diff}usion Models), a novel method for effective street view image generation that fully leverages perspective 3D geometric information. Our PerLDiff employs 3D geometric priors to guide the generation of street view images with precise object-level control within the network learning process, resulting in a more robust and controllable output. Moreover, it demonstrates superior controllability compared to alternative layout control methods. Empirical results justify that our PerLDiff markedly enhances the precision of controllable generation on the NuScenes and KITTI datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

To circumvent these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity. We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile, despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.</p></details> |  | None |

Intermediate representations from diffusion models can be leveraged for downstream visual tasks, while self-supervised vision models can enhance the convergence and generation quality of diffusion models. However, transferring pretrained weights from vision models to diffusion models is challenging due to input mismatches and the use of latent spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Unified Self-supervised Pretraining (USP), a framework that initializes diffusion models via masked latent modeling in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent space. USP achieves comparable performance in understanding tasks while significantly improving the convergence speed and generation quality of diffusion models.

Current approaches either build specialized video models from scratch with enormous computational costs or add separate motion modules to image generators, both requiring learning temporal dynamics anew. We observe that modern image generation models possess underutilized potential in handling structured layouts with implicit temporal understanding. Building on this insight, we introduce GRID, which reformulates temporal sequences as grid layouts, enabling holistic processing of visual sequences while leveraging existing model capabilities. Through a parallel flow-matching training strategy with coarse-to-fine scheduling, our approach achieves up to 67 faster inference speeds while using <1/1000 of the computational resources compared to specialized models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRID not only excels in temporal tasks from Text-to-Video to 3D Editing but also preserves strong performance in image generation, establishing itself as an efficient and versatile omni-solution for visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes: https://github.com/Should-AI-Lab/GRID</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Should-AI-Lab/GRID) |

However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the "1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MSF: Efficient Diffusion Model Via Multi-Scale Latent Factorize](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13349v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion-based generative models have made significant strides in visual content creation, conventional approaches face computational challenges, especially for high-resolution images, as they denoise the entire image from noisy inputs. This contrasts with signal processing techniques, such as Fourier and wavelet analyses, which often employ hierarchical decompositions. Inspired by such principles, particularly the idea of signal separation, we introduce a diffusion framework leveraging multi-scale latent factorization. Our framework uniquely decomposes the denoising target, typically latent features from a pretrained Variational Autoencoder, into a low-frequency base signal capturing core structural information and a high-frequency residual signal that contributes finer, high-frequency details like textures. This decomposition into base and residual components directly informs our two-stage image generation process, which first produces the low-resolution base, followed by the generation of the high-resolution residual. Our proposed architecture facilitates reduced sampling steps during the residual learning stage, owing to the inherent ease of modeling residual information, which confers advantages over conventional full-resolution generation techniques. This specific approach of decomposing the signal into a base and a residual, conceptually akin to how wavelet analysis can separate different frequency bands, yields a more streamlined and intuitive design distinct from generic hierarchical models. Our method, \name\ (Multi-Scale Factorization), demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving FID scores of 2.08 ($256\times256$) and 2.47 ($512\times512$) on class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, outperforming the DiT baseline (2.27 and 3.04 respectively) while also delivering a $4\times$ speed-up with the same number of sampling steps.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Diffusion Training through Parallelization with Truncated Karhunen-Loève Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17657v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion denoising models have become a popular approach for image generation, but they often suffer from slow convergence during training. In this paper, we identify that this slow convergence is partly due to the complexity of the Brownian motion driving the forward-time process. To address this, we represent the Brownian motion using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, truncating it to a limited number of eigenfunctions. We propose a novel ordinary differential equation with augmented random initials, termed KL diffusion, as a new forward-time process for training and sampling. By developing an appropriate denoising loss function, we facilitate the integration of our KL-diffusion into existing denoising-based models. Using the widely adopted DDIM framework as our baseline ensures a fair comparison, as our modifications focus solely on the forward process and loss function, leaving the network architecture and sampling methods unchanged. Our method significantly outperforms baseline diffusion models, achieving convergence speeds that are twice faster to reach the best FID score of the baseline and ultimately yielding much lower FID scores. Notably, our approach allows for highly parallelized computation, requires no additional learnable parameters, and can be flexibly integrated into existing diffusion methods. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, achieving identity personalization-ensuring that a model consistently generates subject-specific outputs from limited reference images-remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we introduce Meta-Low-Rank Adaptation (Meta-LoRA), a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to encode domain-specific priors into LoRA-based identity personalization. Our method introduces a structured three-layer LoRA architecture that separates identity-agnostic knowledge from identity-specific adaptation. In the first stage, the LoRA Meta-Down layers are meta-trained across multiple subjects, learning a shared manifold that captures general identity-related features. In the second stage, only the LoRA-Mid and LoRA-Up layers are optimized to specialize on a given subject, significantly reducing adaptation time while improving identity fidelity. To evaluate our approach, we introduce Meta-PHD, a new benchmark dataset for identity personalization, and compare Meta-LoRA against state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that Meta-LoRA achieves superior identity retention, computational efficiency, and adaptability across diverse identity conditions. Our code, model weights, and dataset are released on barisbatuhan.github.io/Meta-LoRA.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CycleVAR: Repurposing Autoregressive Model for Unsupervised One-Step Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23347v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation, we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Composing Parts for Expressive Object Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10197v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image composition and generation are processes where the artists need control over various parts of the generated images. However, the current state-of-the-art generation models, like Stable Diffusion, cannot handle fine-grained part-level attributes in the text prompts. Specifically, when additional attribute details are added to the base text prompt, these text-to-image models either generate an image vastly different from the image generated from the base prompt or ignore the attribute details. To mitigate these issues, we introduce PartComposer, a training-free method that enables image generation based on fine-grained part-level attributes specified for objects in the base text prompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartComposer first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right region. After obtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each part region based on fine-grained part attributes and combine them to produce the final image. All stages of PartComposer are based on repurposing a pre-trained diffusion model, which enables it to generalize across domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of part-level control provided by PartComposer through qualitative visual examples and quantitative comparisons with contemporary baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page Will Be Here: https://rangwani-harsh.github.io/PartCraft</p></details> | [Code Link](https://rangwani-harsh.github.io/PartCraft) |

This issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps, resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference speeds.</p></details> |  | None |

This study investigates methodologies to suppress unwanted model merging by free-riders. Existing methods such as model watermarking or fingerprinting can only detect merging in hindsight. In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model. Moreover, we analyze potential adaptive attacks and further propose a dropout-based pruning to improve our proposal's robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

The motivation stems from the observation that images exhibit local structures, and spatially distant regions tend to have minimal interdependence. Given a partially decoded set of visual tokens, in addition to the original next-token prediction scheme in the row dimension, the tokens corresponding to spatially adjacent regions in the column dimension can be decoded in parallel, enabling the ``next-set prediction'' paradigm. By decoding multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, the number of forward passes required to generate an image is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that ZipAR can reduce the number of model forward passes by up to 91% on the Emu3-Gen model without requiring any additional retraining.

Prompt-based methodologies have emerged as a pivotal strategy to guide deep learning models, providing flexible, domain-specific adaptations that significantly enhance model performance and adaptability without extensive retraining. This systematic review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of prompt engineering in medical imaging. We dissect diverse prompt modalities, including textual instructions, visual prompts, and learnable embeddings, and analyze their integration for core tasks such as image generation, segmentation, and classification. Our synthesis reveals how these mechanisms improve task-specific outcomes by enhancing accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency and reducing reliance on manual feature engineering while fostering greater model interpretability by making the model's guidance explicit. Despite substantial advancements, we identify persistent challenges, particularly in prompt design optimization, data heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability for clinical deployment. Finally, this review outlines promising future trajectories, including advanced multimodal prompting and robust clinical integration, underscoring the critical role of prompt-driven AI in accelerating the revolution of diagnostics and personalized treatment planning in medicine.</p></details> |  | None |

A fundamental element of the transformer architecture is self-attention, which allows the model to capture intricate dependencies within the data. However, the self-attention mechanism also incurs significant computational and memory costs, particularly for long sequences. In this paper, we introduce ATTENTION2D, a novel approach that exploits parallelism along two dimensions - query and key/value - of the self-attention operation. This method enables efficient distribution and parallelization of computations across multiple devices. Our approach facilitates asymptotically faster training and inference phases compared to previous methods, without relying on approximations or incurring additional computational or memory overheads. Furthermore, unlike existing techniques that struggle to scale with an increasing number of processing units, our approach effectively scales with additional processing units. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in improving communication efficiency and scalability. Compared to Ring Attention, our approach demonstrated up to a 5x performance boost on a GPT-3-like model using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs across 16 nodes, and up to a 9.4x performance boost on 64 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 64 nodes.</p></details> | Updated Table 1 | None |

We develop several technical improvements to address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to professional typography generation.

However, images generated by these methods are often plagued by spatial artifacts such as blurring and ghosting, undermining their reliability as training data for camera pose estimation. This limitation is particularly critical for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which aim at pixel-level 3D coordinate estimation, because rendering artifacts directly lead to estimation inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-criteria filtering mechanism that dynamically identifies and discards suboptimal pixels during training. The dual-criteria filter evaluates two concurrent metrics: (1) real-time SCR reprojection error, and (2) gradient threshold, across the coordinate regression domain. In addition, for visual localization problems in sparse-input scenarios, it becomes even more necessary to use NVS-generated data to assist localization. We design a coarse-to-fine Points of Interest (PoI) variant using sparse-input NVS to solve this problem. Experiments across indoor and outdoor benchmarks confirm our method's efficacy, achieving state-of-the-art localization accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However, generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods, supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images. TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through visual-language alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Note:...</summary><p>Note: This is a preprint version of a paper submitted to AIIDE 2025.

However, the equally important area of remote sensing image (RSI) editing has not received sufficient attention. Deep learning based editing methods generally involve two sequential stages: generation and editing.For natural images, these stages primarily rely on generative backbones pre-trained on large-scale benchmark datasets and text guidance facilitated by vision-language models (VLMs). However, it become less viable for RSIs: First, existing generative RSI benchmark datasets do not fully capture the diversity of RSIs, and is often inadequate for universal editing tasks. Second, the single text semantic corresponds to multiple image semantics, leading to the introduction of incorrect semantics.To solve above problems, this paper proposes a text-guided RSI editing method and can be trained using only a single image. A multi-scale training approach is adopted to preserve consistency without the need for training on extensive benchmarks, while leveraging RSI pre-trained VLMs and prompt ensembling (PE) to ensure accuracy and controllability. Experimental results on multiple RSI editing tasks show that the proposed method offers significant advantages in both CLIP scores and subjective evaluations compared to existing methods. Additionally, we explore the ability of the edited RSIs to support disaster assessment tasks in order to validate their practicality.

Current finetuning-free methods simply adopt a single training stage with a simple image reconstruction task, and they typically generate low-quality images inconsistent with the reference images during test-time. To mitigate this problem, inspired by the recent DPO (i.e., direct preference optimization) technique, this work proposes an additional training stage to improve the pre-trained personalized generation models. However, traditional DPO only determines the overall superiority or inferiority of two samples, which is not suitable for personalized image generation because the generated images are commonly inconsistent with the reference images only in some local image patches. To tackle this problem, this work proposes PatchDPO that estimates the quality of image patches within each generated image and accordingly trains the model. To this end, PatchDPO first leverages the pre-trained vision model with a proposed self-supervised training method to estimate the patch quality. Next, PatchDPO adopts a weighted training approach to train the model with the estimated patch quality, which rewards the image patches with high quality while penalizing the image patches with low quality. Experiment results demonstrate that PatchDPO significantly improves the performance of multiple pre-trained personalized generation models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-object and multi-object personalized image generation.

| **[Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models: Advances, Challenges, and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02567v4)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community.

However, video generation still faces considerable challenges in various aspects, such as controllability, video length, and richness of details, which hinder the application and popularization of this technology. In this work, we propose a controllable video generation framework, dubbed MimicMotion, which can generate high-quality videos of arbitrary length mimicking specific motion guidance. Compared with previous methods, our approach has several highlights. Firstly, we introduce confidence-aware pose guidance that ensures high frame quality and temporal smoothness. Secondly, we introduce regional loss amplification based on pose confidence, which significantly reduces image distortion. Lastly, for generating long and smooth videos, we propose a progressive latent fusion strategy. By this means, we can produce videos of arbitrary length with acceptable resource consumption. With extensive experiments and user studies, MimicMotion demonstrates significant improvements over previous approaches in various aspects.

However, their real-time feasibility is hindered by slow training and inference speeds. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a wavelet-based conditional Diffusion GAN scheme for Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR). Our approach utilizes the diffusion GAN paradigm to reduce the timesteps required by the reverse diffusion process and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to achieve dimensionality reduction, decreasing training and inference times significantly. The results of an experimental validation on the CelebA-HQ dataset confirm the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methodologies successfully ensuring high-fidelity output while overcoming inherent drawbacks associated with diffusion models in time-sensitive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted at Italian Workshop on Neural Networks (WIRN) 2024</p></details> | None |

| **[On the Feasibility of Poisoning Text-to-Image AI Models via Adversarial Mislabeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21874v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of injecting strong "dirty-label" poison samples into the training pipeline for text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective, they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success (over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex AI and Microsoft Azure).</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM C...</summary><p>ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2025</p></details> | None |

This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules: Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists. Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls, though they requested finer narrative editing tools.

Drawing on the classical concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.</p></details> |  | None |

However, rapid T2I model advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions, including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model comparisons within the T2I research community.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.</p></details> |  | None |

Although such models can generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our $\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully reproducible experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, these models still struggle with panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.</p></details> |  | None |

Researchers are now exploring controllable data generation using world models to diversify datasets. However, previous work has been limited to studying image generation quality on specific public datasets. There is still relatively little research on how to build data generation engines for real-world application scenes to achieve large-scale data generation for challenging scenes. In this paper, a simulator-conditioned scene generation engine based on world model is proposed. By constructing a simulation system consistent with real-world scenes, simulation data and labels, which serve as the conditions for data generation in the world model, for any scenes can be collected. It is a novel data generation pipeline by combining the powerful scene simulation capabilities of the simulation engine with the robust data generation capabilities of the world model. In addition, a benchmark with proportionally constructed virtual and real data, is provided for exploring the capabilities of world models in real-world scenes. Quantitative results show that these generated images significantly improve downstream perception models performance. Finally, we explored the generative performance of the world model in urban autonomous driving scenarios.

Although quantization paves a way for model compression and acceleration, existing methods face challenges in achieving low-bit quantization efficiently. In this paper, we identify imbalanced activation distributions as a primary source of quantization difficulty, and propose to adjust these distributions through weight finetuning to be more quantization-friendly. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while enhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across three high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple bit-width settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

These models operate in a bitwise autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore, it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable detection of generated outputs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the greater the generalization power, the more likely the unintended generalization, and the more dangerous the abuse. Research on moderated generalization in SGMs remains limited. To fill this gap, we first examine the current 'gold standard' in Machine Unlearning (MU), i.e., re-training the model after removing the undesirable training data, and find it does not work in SGMs. Further analysis of score functions reveals that the MU 'gold standard' does not alter the original score function, which explains its ineffectiveness. Based on this insight, we propose the first Moderated Score-based Generative Model (MSGM), which introduces a novel score adjustment strategy that redirects the score function away from undesirable data during the continuous-time stochastic differential equation process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGM significantly reduces the likelihood of generating undesirable content while preserving high visual quality for normal image generation. Albeit designed for SGMs, MSGM is a general and flexible MU framework that is compatible with diverse diffusion architectures (SGM and DDPM) and training strategies (re-training and fine-tuning), and enables zero-shot transfer of the pre-trained models to downstream tasks, e.g. image inpainting and reconstruction. The code will be shared upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e., adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional generation.

Recent advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents. By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128 discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10 times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware noise.</p></details> |  | None |

We demonstrate our method utilizing Neighborhood Attention (NA) and integrate it into a StyleGAN based architecture for image generation. With this work, dubbed StyleNAT, we are able to achieve a FID of 2.05 on FFHQ, a 6% improvement over StyleGAN-XL, while utilizing 28% fewer parameters and with 4$\times$ the throughput capacity.

However, dense representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods. Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species generation through sparse signals.

Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However, existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models, depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include: (1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2) the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at https://github.com/zgg2577/VS-KC.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

| **[Diffusion Tree Sampling: Scalable inference-time alignment of diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20701v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation, DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$ effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to $5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Video Perception Models for 3D Scene Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20601v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability, which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes. Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation, utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse scenarios. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

However, training diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free, zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring retraining or architectural modifications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their application in medical image generation still faces significant challenges, including small dataset sizes, and scarcity of medical textual data. To address these challenges, we propose Med-Art, a framework specifically designed for medical image generation with limited data. Med-Art leverages vision-language models to generate visual descriptions of medical images which overcomes the scarcity of applicable medical textual data. Med-Art adapts a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model, PixArt-$\alpha$, based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), achieving high performance under limited data. Furthermore, we propose an innovative Hybrid-Level Diffusion Fine-tuning (HLDF) method, which enables pixel-level losses, effectively addressing issues such as overly saturated colors. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on two medical image datasets, measured by FID, KID, and downstream classification performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is available at \url{https://medart-ai.github.io}</p></details> | None |

However, removing undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation (WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark, Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility preservation.

The model generates novel output views by incorporating semantic context from text and image inputs. Using a simple sequence concatenation approach, FLUX.1 Kontext handles both local editing and generative in-context tasks within a single unified architecture. Compared to current editing models that exhibit degradation in character consistency and stability across multiple turns, we observe that FLUX.1 Kontext improved preservation of objects and characters, leading to greater robustness in iterative workflows. The model achieves competitive performance with current state-of-the-art systems while delivering significantly faster generation times, enabling interactive applications and rapid prototyping workflows. To validate these improvements, we introduce KontextBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 1026 image-prompt pairs covering five task categories: local editing, global editing, character reference, style reference and text editing. Detailed evaluations show the superior performance of FLUX.1 Kontext in terms of both single-turn quality and multi-turn consistency, setting new standards for unified image processing models.</p></details> |  | None |

Current safety measures are typically limited to text-based filtering or concept removal strategies, able to remove just a few concepts from the model's generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce AlignGuard, a method for safety alignment of T2I models. We enable the application of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for safety purposes in T2I models by synthetically generating a dataset of harmful and safe image-text pairs, which we call CoProV2. Using a custom DPO strategy and this dataset, we train safety experts, in the form of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices, able to guide the generation process away from specific safety-related concepts. Then, we merge the experts into a single LoRA using a novel merging strategy for optimal scaling performance. This expert-based approach enables scalability, allowing us to remove 7x more harmful concepts from T2I models compared to baselines. AlignGuard consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmarks and establishes new practices for safety alignment in T2I networks.

However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks.

Hence, many text-to-image models have implemented diversification mechanisms. Yet, after a few iterations of generation, a lack of diversity becomes apparent, because each user has their own diversity goals (e.g., different colors, brands of cars), and there are diverse attributions to be specified. To support user-driven diversity control, we propose Varif.ai that employs text-to-image and Large Language Models to iteratively i) (re)generate a set of images, ii) verify if user-specified attributes have sufficient coverage, and iii) vary existing or new attributes. Through an elicitation study, we uncovered user needs for diversity in image generation. A pilot validation showed that Varif.ai made achieving diverse image sets easier. In a controlled evaluation with 20 participants, Varif.ai proved more effective than baseline methods across various scenarios. Thus, this supports user control of diversity in image generation for creative ideation and scalable image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>DIS20...</summary><p>DIS2025, code available at github.com/mario-michelessa/varifai</p></details> | [Code Link](http://github.com/mario-michelessa/varifai) |

However, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather limited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model) considers minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I model for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the machine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained model will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not generate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we consider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer recognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To achieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with gradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with theoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\epsilon, \delta)$-unlearning guarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is further fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We also propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively removed the influence of forget samples. Extensive empirical evaluation on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places365 highlights the superiority of our approach. To show comparable performance with retrained model, we also show the comparison of a simple AutoEncoder on various baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02514v4)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image AutoRegressive generation has emerged as a new powerful paradigm with image autoregressive models (IARs) matching state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) in image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) while allowing for a higher generation speed. However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns regarding their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to the ones of DMs as reference points. Concretely, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images (with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% of 86.38% vs. 6.38% for DMs with comparable attacks). We leverage our novel MIA to provide dataset inference (DI) for IARs, and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership (compared to 200 for DI in DMs), confirming a higher information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance. We release the code at https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars for reproducibility.</p></details> | Accepted at ICML2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars) |

Recent works suggest synthetic data as an alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data. Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets, enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11% reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a 10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real training sets are not available.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we argue that the static FR strategy, predominantly adopted in prior literature for evaluating AFR efficacy, cannot faithfully characterize the actual capabilities of determined trackers who aim to track a specific target identity. In particular, we introduce DynTracker, a dynamic FR strategy where the model's gallery database is iteratively updated with newly recognized target identity images. Surprisingly, such a simple approach renders all the existing AFR protections ineffective. To mitigate the privacy threats posed by DynTracker, we advocate for explicitly promoting diversity in the AFR-protected images. We hypothesize that the lack of diversity is the primary cause of the failure of existing AFR methods. Specifically, we develop DivTrackee, a novel method for crafting diverse AFR protections that builds upon a text-guided image generation framework and diversity-promoting adversarial losses. Through comprehensive experiments on various image benchmarks and feature extractors, we demonstrate DynTracker's strength in breaking existing AFR methods and the superiority of DivTrackee in preventing user facial images from being identified by dynamic FR strategies. We believe our work can act as an important initial step towards developing more effective AFR methods for protecting user facial privacy against determined trackers.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the field lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation methods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic images for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs) as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides actionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data generation methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security '25). 21 pages, plus a 6-page appendix</p></details> | None |

While remarkable progress has been made in image generation and style transfer, the underlying mechanisms and aesthetic implications of these technologies remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AIGC technologies in visual arts, tracing their evolution from early algorithmic frameworks to contemporary deep generative models. We identify three pivotal paradigms: Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion Models, and examine their roles in bridging the gap between human creativity and machine synthesis.

Furthermore, we propose a multidimensional evaluation framework that incorporates Technical Innovation, Artistic Merit, Visual Quality, Computational Efficiency, and Creative Potential. Our findings reveal both the transformative capacities and current limitations of AIGC systems, emphasizing their profound impact on the future of creative practices.

In this paper, we introduce RAP, a principled framework that treats rare concept generation as navigating a latent causal path: a progressive, model-aligned trajectory through the generative space from frequent concepts to rare targets. Rather than relying on heuristic prompt alternation, we theoretically justify that rare prompt guidance can be approximated by semantically related frequent prompts. We then formulate prompt switching as a dynamic process based on score similarity, enabling adaptive stage transitions. Furthermore, we reinterpret prompt alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism, promoting smooth semantic progression and coherent visual synthesis. Through this causal lens, we align input scheduling with the model's internal generative dynamics. Experiments across diverse diffusion backbones demonstrate that RAP consistently enhances rare concept generation, outperforming strong baselines in both automated evaluations and human studies.</p></details> |  | None |

Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts. We empirically demonstrate on COCO and DiffusionDB that by learning to route to nine already-trained text-to-image models, our approach is able to deliver an average quality that is higher than that achievable by any of these models alone.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we explore how generative models can further be used not only to synthesize visual content but also to understand the properties of a scene given a natural image. We formulate scene understanding as an inverse generative modeling problem, where we seek to find conditional parameters of a visual generative model to best fit a given natural image. To enable this procedure to infer scene structure from images substantially different than those seen during training, we further propose to build this visual generative model compositionally from smaller models over pieces of a scene. We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set of objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with an increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this enables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust generalization to new scenes. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be directly applied to existing pretrained text-to-image generative models for zero-shot multi-object perception.

While the linear-complexity Mamba model emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards 2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future exploration.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OmniGen2: Exploration to Advanced Multimodal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18871v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks, including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code, datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this field.

In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for spatio-temporal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia.

An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Image Captions are Natural Prompts for Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08526v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), it has become a common practice to train models on synthetic data due to data-scarcity and privacy leakage problems. Owing to massive and diverse information conveyed in real images, it is challenging for text-to-image generative models to synthesize informative training data with hand-crafted prompts. Considering the impressive ability of large generative models, could such models directly synthesize good training images for prediction tasks with proper prompts? We offer an affirmative response to this question by proposing a simple yet effective method, validated through ImageNet classification. Specifically, we caption each real image with the advanced captioning model to obtain informative and faithful prompts that extract class-relevant information and clarify the polysemy of class names. The image captions and class names are concatenated to prompt generative models for training image synthesis. We show that this simple caption incorporation significantly boosts the informativeness of synthetic data therefore enhancing downstream model generalization. More importantly, besides improvements in data augmentation and privacy preservation, our experiments demonstrate that synthesized images can exceed real data in terms of out-of-distribution robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 2 figure, 15 tables.

Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast, VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Auto-Regressively Generating Multi-View Consistent Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18527v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR) method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the "Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading diffusion-based multi-view image generation models.

However, the impact of technical factors on these images can pose challenges for reliable AI applications in ophthalmology. For example, large fundus cohorts are often confounded by factors like camera type, bearing the risk of learning shortcuts rather than the causal relationships behind the image generation process. Here, we introduce a population model for retinal fundus images that effectively disentangles patient attributes from camera effects, enabling controllable and highly realistic image generation. To achieve this, we propose a disentanglement loss based on distance correlation. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we show that our models encode desired information in disentangled subspaces and enable controllable image generation based on the learned subspaces, demonstrating the effectiveness of our disentanglement loss.

For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios, relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation, and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation. Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions, incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments and user studies validate ShowFlow's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in real-world applications like advertising and virtual dressing.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this, we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation from natural language.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18325v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, has enhanced their capability to synthesize images from textual prompts. However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse, including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence, discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications, this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants: PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics, effectively balancing safety and usability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LAPIG: Language Guided Projector Image Generation with Surface Adaptation and Stylization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12173v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LAPIG, a language guided projector image generation method with surface adaptation and stylization. LAPIG consists of a projector-camera system and a target textured projection surface. LAPIG takes the user text prompt as input and aims to transform the surface style using the projector. LAPIG's key challenge is that due to the projector's physical brightness limitation and the surface texture, the viewer's perceived projection may suffer from color saturation and artifacts in both dark and bright regions, such that even with the state-of-the-art projector compensation techniques, the viewer may see clear surface texture-related artifacts. Therefore, how to generate a projector image that follows the user's instruction while also displaying minimum surface artifacts is an open problem. To address this issue, we propose projection surface adaptation (PSA) that can generate compensable surface stylization. We first train two networks to simulate the projector compensation and project-and-capture processes, this allows us to find a satisfactory projector image without real project-and-capture and utilize gradient descent for fast convergence. Then, we design content and saturation losses to guide the projector image generation, such that the generated image shows no clearly perceivable artifacts when projected. Finally, the generated image is projected for visually pleasing surface style morphing effects. The source code and video are available on the project page: https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG/.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | [Code Link](https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG) |
| **[Morse: Dual-Sampling for Lossless Acceleration of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18251v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies. Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type, but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image synthesis.

These methods typically convert images into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism, which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics, spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

To democratize these capabilities, we present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and 46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities. Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor, Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably, it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8 A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the lengthy denoising process and complex neural networks hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Quantization can effectively reduce model complexity, and post-training quantization (PTQ), which does not require fine-tuning, is highly promising for compressing and accelerating diffusion models. Unfortunately, we find that due to the highly dynamic activations, existing PTQ methods suffer from distribution mismatch issues at both calibration sample level and reconstruction output level, which makes the performance far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose EDA-DM, a standardized PTQ method that efficiently addresses the above issues. Specifically, at the calibration sample level, we extract information from the density and diversity of latent space feature maps, which guides the selection of calibration samples to align with the overall sample distribution; and at the reconstruction output level, we theoretically analyze the reasons for previous reconstruction failures and, based on this insight, optimize block reconstruction using the Hessian loss of layers, aligning the outputs of quantized model and full-precision model at different network granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDA-DM significantly outperforms the existing PTQ methods across various models and datasets. Our method achieves a 1.83 times speedup and 4 times compression for the popular Stable-Diffusion on MS-COCO, with only a 0.05 loss in CLIP score.

However, fully synthetic datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations, such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy.

Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases.

Traditional approaches, however, are hindered by arduous manual annotation and data collection, struggling to adapt to ever-changing environments and novel target objects. To address these limitations, this paper presents DART, an innovative automated end-to-end pipeline that revolutionizes object detection workflows from data collection to model evaluation. It eliminates the need for laborious human labeling and extensive data collection while achieving outstanding accuracy across diverse scenarios. DART encompasses four key stages: (1) Data Diversification using subject-driven image generation (DreamBooth with SDXL), (2) Annotation via open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO) to generate bounding box and class labels, (3) Review of generated images and pseudo-labels by large multimodal models (InternVL-1.5 and GPT-4o) to guarantee credibility, and (4) Training of real-time object detectors (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10) using the verified data. We apply DART to a self-collected dataset of construction machines named Liebherr Product, which contains over 15K high-quality images across 23 categories. The current instantiation of DART significantly increases average precision (AP) from 0.064 to 0.832. Its modular design ensures easy exchangeability and extensibility, allowing for future algorithm upgrades, seamless integration of new object categories, and adaptability to customized environments without manual labeling and additional data collection.

For precise control of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules. Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously. Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained from bidirectional LSTM.

This work systematically investigates whether images generated on-the-fly by Text-to-Image (T2I) models can serve as a valuable complementary modality for text-centric tasks. Through a comprehensive evaluation framework on text classification, we analyze the impact of critical variables, including T2I model quality, prompt engineering strategies, and multimodal fusion architectures. Our findings demonstrate that this``synthetic perception" can yield significant performance gains, even when augmenting strong large language model baselines. However, we find the effectiveness of this approach is highly conditional, depending critically on the semantic alignment between text and the generated image, the inherent ``visual groundability" of the task, and the generative fidelity of the T2I model. Our work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for this paradigm, providing a clear analysis of its potential and current limitations, and demonstrating its viability as a pathway to enrich language understanding in traditionally unimodal scenarios.</p></details> | 4 figures,7 tables | None |
