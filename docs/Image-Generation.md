| **[One-step Latent-free Image Generation with Pixel Mean Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22158v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.</p></details> | Technical report | None |
| **[Creative Image Generation with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22125v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creative image generation has emerged as a compelling area of research, driven by the need to produce novel and high-quality images that expand the boundaries of imagination. In this work, we propose a novel framework for creative generation using diffusion models, where creativity is associated with the inverse probability of an image's existence in the CLIP embedding space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a manual blending of concepts or exclusion of subcategories, our method calculates the probability distribution of generated images and drives it towards low-probability regions to produce rare, imaginative, and visually captivating outputs. We also introduce pullback mechanisms, achieving high creativity without sacrificing visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our creative generation framework, showcasing its ability to produce unique, novel, and thought-provoking images. This work provides a new perspective on creativity in generative models, offering a principled method to foster innovation in visual content synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://creative-t2i.github.io</p></details> | None |
| **[RefAny3D: 3D Asset-Referenced Diffusion Models for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22094v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a 3D asset-referenced diffusion model for image generation, exploring how to integrate 3D assets into image diffusion models. Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026.

| **[Investigating Associational Biases in Inter-Model Communication of Large Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22093v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social bias in generative AI can manifest not only as performance disparities but also as associational bias, whereby models learn and reproduce stereotypical associations between concepts and demographic groups, even in the absence of explicit demographic information (e.g., associating doctors with men). These associations can persist, propagate, and potentially amplify across repeated exchanges in inter-model communication pipelines, where one generative model's output becomes another's input. This is especially salient for human-centred perception tasks, such as human activity recognition and affect prediction, where inferences about behaviour and internal states can lead to errors or stereotypical associations that propagate into unequal treatment. In this work, focusing on human activity and affective expression, we study how such associations evolve within an inter-model communication pipeline that alternates between image generation and image description. Using the RAF-DB and PHASE datasets, we quantify demographic distribution drift induced by model-to-model information exchange and assess whether these drifts are systematic using an explainability pipeline. Our results reveal demographic drifts toward younger representations for both actions and emotions, as well as toward more female-presenting representations, primarily for emotions. We further find evidence that some predictions are supported by spurious visual regions (e.g., background or hair) rather than concept-relevant cues (e.g., body or face). We also examine whether these demographic drifts translate into measurable differences in downstream behaviour, i.e., while predicting activity and emotion labels. Finally, we outline mitigation strategies spanning data-centric, training and deployment interventions, and emphasise the need for careful safeguards when deploying interconnected models in human-centred AI systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FreeFuse: Multi-Subject LoRA Fusion via Adaptive Token-Level Routing at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23515v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes FreeFuse, a training-free framework for multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple subject LoRAs. In contrast to prior studies that focus on retraining LoRA to alleviate feature conflicts, our analysis reveals that simply spatially confining the subject LoRA's output to its target region and preventing other LoRAs from directly intruding into this area is sufficient for effective mitigation. Accordingly, we implement Adaptive Token-Level Routing during the inference phase. We introduce FreeFuseAttn, a mechanism that exploits the flow matching model's intrinsic semantic alignment to dynamically match subject-specific tokens to their corresponding spatial regions at early denoising timesteps, thereby bypassing the need for external segmentors. FreeFuse distinguishes itself through high practicality: it necessitates no additional training, model modifications, or user-defined masks spatial conditions. Users need only provide subject activation words to achieve seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both identity preservation and compositional fidelity.

| **[OMP: One-step Meanflow Policy with Directional Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19347v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot manipulation has increasingly adopted data-driven generative policy frameworks, yet the field faces a persistent trade-off: diffusion models suffer from high inference latency, while flow-based methods often require complex architectural constraints. Although in image generation domain, the MeanFlow paradigm offers a path to single-step inference, its direct application to robotics is impeded by critical theoretical pathologies, specifically spectral bias and gradient starvation in low-velocity regimes. To overcome these limitations, we propose the One-step MeanFlow Policy (OMP), a novel framework designed for high-fidelity, real-time manipulation. We introduce a lightweight directional alignment mechanism to explicitly synchronize predicted velocities with true mean velocities. Furthermore, we implement a Differential Derivation Equation (DDE) to approximate the Jacobian-Vector Product (JVP) operator, which decouples forward and backward passes to significantly reduce memory complexity. Extensive experiments on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that OMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in success rate and trajectory accuracy, particularly in high-precision tasks, while retaining the efficiency of single-step generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Do We Need EMA for Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement? Toward a Magnitude-Preserving Network Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05216v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study diffusion-based speech enhancement using a Schrodinger bridge formulation and extend the EDM2 framework to this setting. We employ time-dependent preconditioning of network inputs and outputs to stabilize training and explore two skip-connection configurations that allow the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. To control activation and weight magnitudes, we adopt a magnitude-preserving architecture and learn the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for improved conditioning. We further analyze the impact of exponential moving average (EMA) parameter smoothing by approximating different EMA profiles post training, finding that, unlike in image generation, short or absent EMA consistently yields better speech enhancement performance. Experiments on VoiceBank-DEMAND and EARS-WHAM demonstrate competitive signal-to-distortion ratios and perceptual scores, with the two skip-connection variants exhibiting complementary strengths. These findings provide new insights into EMA behavior, magnitude preservation, and skip-connection design for diffusion-based speech enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient4D: Fast Dynamic 3D Object Generation from a Single-view Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08742v5)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating dynamic 3D object from a single-view video is challenging due to the lack of 4D labeled data. An intuitive approach is to extend previous image-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such as score distillation sampling.However, this approach would be slow and expensive to scale due to the need for back-propagating the information-limited supervision signals through a large pretrained model. To address this, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to directly reconstruct the 4D content through a 4D Gaussian splatting model. Importantly, our method can achieve real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories. To enable robust reconstruction under sparse views, we introduce inconsistency-aware confidence-weighted loss design, along with a lightly weighted score distillation loss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed when compared to prior art alternatives while preserving the quality of novel view synthesis. For example, Efficient4D takes only 10 minutes to model a dynamic object, vs 120 minutes by the previous art model Consistent4D.</p></details> | IJCV version | None |
| **[Noise as a Probe: Membership Inference Attacks on Diffusion Models Leveraging Initial Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21628v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in image generation, but their increasing deployment raises serious concerns about privacy. In particular, fine-tuned models are highly vulnerable, as they are often fine-tuned on small and private datasets. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are used to assess privacy risks by determining whether a specific sample was part of a model's training data. Existing MIAs against diffusion models either assume obtaining the intermediate results or require auxiliary datasets for training the shadow model. In this work, we utilized a critical yet overlooked vulnerability: the widely used noise schedules fail to fully eliminate semantic information in the images, resulting in residual semantic signals even at the maximum noise step. We empirically demonstrate that the fine-tuned diffusion model captures hidden correlations between the residual semantics in initial noise and the original images. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective membership inference attack, which injects semantic information into the initial noise and infers membership by analyzing the model's generation result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the semantic initial noise can strongly reveal membership information, highlighting the vulnerability of diffusion models to MIAs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Membership Inference Attacks on Diffusion Models from a Frequency-Domain Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20955v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in image generation, but they also raise significant concerns regarding privacy and copyright issues. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are designed to ascertain whether specific data were utilized during a model's training phase. As current MIAs for diffusion models typically exploit the model's image prediction ability, we formalize them into a unified general paradigm which computes the membership score for membership identification. Under this paradigm, we empirically find that existing attacks overlook the inherent deficiency in how diffusion models process high-frequency information. Consequently, this deficiency leads to member data with more high-frequency content being misclassified as hold-out data, and hold-out data with less high-frequency content tend to be misclassified as member data. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that this deficiency reduces the membership advantage of attacks, thereby interfering with the effective discrimination of member data and hold-out data. Based on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play high-frequency filter module to mitigate the adverse effects of the deficiency, which can be seamlessly integrated into any attacks within this general paradigm without additional time costs. Extensive experiments corroborate that this module significantly improves the performance of baseline attacks across different datasets and models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DyPE: Dynamic Position Extrapolation for Ultra High Resolution Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20766v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve. Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation, with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions.

| **[SimGraph: A Unified Framework for Scene Graph-Based Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21498v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of both image generation and editing. However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Revisiting Diffusion Model Predictions Through Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21419v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted a shift in the preferred prediction target -- moving from noise ($\varepsilon$) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction -- particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures | None |

Starting from simple user prompts, TIPO leverages a lightweight pre-trained model to expand these prompts into richer and more detailed versions. Conceptually, TIPO samples refined prompts from a targeted sub-distribution within the broader semantic space, preserving the original intent while significantly improving visual quality, coherence, and detail. Unlike resource-intensive methods based on large language models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO offers strong computational efficiency and scalability, opening new possibilities for effective automated prompt engineering in T2I tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that TIPO achieves stronger text alignment, reduced visual artifacts, and consistently higher human preference rates, while maintaining competitive aesthetic quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of distribution-aligned prompt engineering and point toward broader opportunities for scalable, automated refinement in text-to-image generation.</p></details> | 50 pages, 28 figures | None |
| **[Shape of Thought: Progressive Object Assembly via Visual Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21081v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models for text-to-image generation have achieved strong visual fidelity, yet they remain brittle under compositional structural constraints-notably generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations. To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/.

| **[Non-Markov Multi-Round Conversational Image Generation with History-Conditioned MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20911v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 19 figures, plan for TIP</p></details> | None |
| **[AEDR: Training-Free AI-Generated Image Attribution via Autoencoder Double-Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18988v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency. Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5% higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while requiring only 1% of the computational time.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

| **[Detecting and Mitigating Memorization in Diffusion Models through Anisotropy of the Log-Probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20642v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based image generative models produce high-fidelity images through iterative denoising but remain vulnerable to memorization, where they unintentionally reproduce exact copies or parts of training images. Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[CLIP-Guided Unsupervised Semantic-Aware Exposure Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19129v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improper exposure often leads to severe loss of details, color distortion, and reduced contrast. Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026</p></details> | None |

Currently, GAI shows limited capability in the specialized domains due to data scarcity. In this paper, we develop a continuum mechanics-based theoretical framework to generalize the optimal transport theory from pure mathematics, which can be used to describe the dynamics of data, realizing the generative tasks with a small amount of data. The developed theory is used to solve three typical problem involved in many mechanical designs and engineering applications: at material level, how to generate the stress-strain response outside the range of experimental conditions based on experimentally measured stress-strain data; at structure level, how to generate the temperature-dependent stress fields under the thermal loading; at system level, how to generate the plastic strain fields under transient dynamic loading. Our results show the proposed theory can complete the generation successfully, showing its potential to solve many difficult problems involved in engineering applications, not limited to mechanics problems, such as image generation. The present work shows that mechanics can provide new tools for computer science. The limitation of the proposed theory is also discussed.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing deepfake detectors often generalize poorly to images produced by unseen generators. Notably, despite being trained under vastly different paradigms, such as diffusion or autoregressive modeling, many modern image generators share common final architectural components that serve as the last stage for converting intermediate representations into images. Motivated by this insight, we propose to "contaminate" real images using the generator's final component and train a detector to distinguish them from the original real images. We further introduce a taxonomy based on generators' final components and categorize 21 widely used generators accordingly, enabling a comprehensive investigation of our method's generalization capability. Using only 100 samples from each of three representative categories, our detector-fine-tuned on the DINOv3 backbone-achieves an average accuracy of 98.83% across 22 testing sets from unseen generators.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike unified models that face expensive training costs and understanding-generation trade-offs, GenAgent decouples these capabilities through an agentic framework: understanding is handled by the multimodal model itself, while generation is achieved by treating image generation models as invokable tools. Crucially, unlike existing modular systems constrained by static pipelines, this design enables autonomous multi-turn interactions where the agent generates multimodal chains-of-thought encompassing reasoning, tool invocation, judgment, and reflection to iteratively refine outputs. We employ a two-stage training strategy: first, cold-start with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality tool invocation and reflection data to bootstrap agent behaviors; second, end-to-end agentic reinforcement learning combining pointwise rewards (final image quality) and pairwise rewards (reflection accuracy), with trajectory resampling for enhanced multi-turn exploration. GenAgent significantly boosts base generator(FLUX.1-dev) performance on GenEval++ (+23.6\%) and WISE (+14\%). Beyond performance gains, our framework demonstrates three key properties: 1) cross-tool generalization to generators with varying capabilities, 2) test-time scaling with consistent improvements across interaction rounds, and 3) task-adaptive reasoning that automatically adjusts to different tasks.

However, unlike diffusion models, AR models lack a mechanism to refine previous predictions, limiting their generation quality. In this paper, we introduce TensorAR, a new AR paradigm that reformulates image generation from next-token prediction to next-tensor prediction. By generating overlapping windows of image patches (tensors) in a sliding fashion, TensorAR enables iterative refinement of previously generated content. To prevent information leakage during training, we propose a discrete tensor noising scheme, which perturbs input tokens via codebook-indexed noise. TensorAR is implemented as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing AR models. Extensive experiments on LlamaGEN, Open-MAGVIT2, and RAR demonstrate that TensorAR significantly improves the generation performance of autoregressive models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Reversible Efficient Diffusion for Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20260v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal image fusion aims to consolidate complementary information from diverse source images into a unified representation. The fused image is expected to preserve fine details and maintain high visual fidelity. While diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities in image generation, they often suffer from detail loss when applied to image fusion tasks. This issue arises from the accumulation of noise errors inherent in the Markov process, leading to inconsistency and degradation in the fused results. However, incorporating explicit supervision into end-to-end training of diffusion-based image fusion introduces challenges related to computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Reversible Efficient Diffusion (RED) model - an explicitly supervised training framework that inherits the powerful generative capability of diffusion models while avoiding the distribution estimation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DenseGRPO: From Sparse to Dense Reward for Flow Matching Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20218v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent GRPO-based approaches built on flow matching models have shown remarkable improvements in human preference alignment for text-to-image generation. Nevertheless, they still suffer from the sparse reward problem: the terminal reward of the entire denoising trajectory is applied to all intermediate steps, resulting in a mismatch between the global feedback signals and the exact fine-grained contributions at intermediate denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space. Thus, we propose a reward-aware scheme to calibrate the exploration space by adaptively adjusting a timestep-specific stochasticity injection in the SDE sampler, ensuring a suitable exploration space at all timesteps. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DenseGRPO and highlight the critical role of the valid dense rewards in flow matching model alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |

This divide, rooted in the distinction between VQ-VAEs and VAEs, hinders unified modeling and fair benchmarking. Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers a theoretical bridge, yet vanilla FSQ suffers from a critical flaw: its equal-interval quantization can cause activation collapse. This mismatch forces a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and information efficiency. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by simply replacing the activation function in original FSQ with a distribution-matching mapping to enforce a uniform prior. Termed iFSQ, this simple strategy requires just one line of code yet mathematically guarantees both optimal bin utilization and reconstruction precision. Leveraging iFSQ as a controlled benchmark, we uncover two key insights: (1) The optimal equilibrium between discrete and continuous representations lies at approximately 4 bits per dimension. (2) Under identical reconstruction constraints, AR models exhibit rapid initial convergence, whereas diffusion models achieve a superior performance ceiling, suggesting that strict sequential ordering may limit the upper bounds of generation quality. Finally, we extend our analysis by adapting Representation Alignment (REPA) to AR models, yielding LlamaGen-REPA.

However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns about copyright infringement and the misuse of generated content. Watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution, enabling copyright identification and misuse tracing through imperceptible markers embedded in generated images. Among these, latent-based watermarking techniques are particularly promising, as they embed watermarks directly into the latent noise without altering the underlying LDM architecture. In this work, we demonstrate that such latent-based watermarks are practically vulnerable to detection and compromise through systematic analysis of output images' statistical patterns for the first time. To counter this, we propose SWA-LDM (Stealthy Watermark for LDM), a lightweight framework that enhances stealth by dynamically randomizing the embedded watermarks using the Gaussian-distributed latent noise inherent to diffusion models. By embedding unique, pattern-free signatures per image, SWA-LDM eliminates detectable artifacts while preserving image quality and extraction robustness. Experiments demonstrate an average of 20% improvement in stealth over state-of-the-art methods, enabling secure deployment of watermarked generative AI in real-world applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Cortex-Grounded Diffusion Models for Brain Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19498v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.</p></details> | preprint | None |
| **[Generation then Reconstruction: Accelerating Masked Autoregressive Models via Two-Stage Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17171v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding, followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens. Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover, observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1), substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in https://github.com/feihongyan1/GtR.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/feihongyan1/GtR) |

Our method adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |

Over the past three decades, advances in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli to brain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research has expanded to decode more complex processes, such as language and memory across the whole brain, using techniques to handle greater variability and improve signal accuracy. We argue that "seeing" involves more than just mapping visual stimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as various emotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. In this paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visual processes by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals are exposed to visual stimuli. We utilize transformer-based large-scale fMRI encoders and Image generative models (encoders & decoders) pre-trained on large public datasets, which are then fine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models can decode visual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditional confines of the visual cortex. Using a public dataset (BOLD5000), we first compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches for decoding visual processing and show improved predictive semantic accuracy by 43%. A network ablation analysis suggests that, beyond the visual cortex, the default mode network contributes significantly to stimulus decoding, in line with the proposed role of this network in sense-making and semantic processing.</p></details> |  | None |

In few-shot NVS, where only a few input views are available, existing methods often assume equal importance for all input views relative to the target, leading to suboptimal results. We address this limitation by introducing a camera-weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of source views based on their relevance to the target. We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality. This mechanism is adaptable and can be integrated into various NVS algorithms, improving their ability to synthesize high-quality novel views. Our results demonstrate that adaptive view weighting enhances accuracy and realism, offering a promising direction for improving NVS.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICIP ...</summary><p>ICIP 2025 Workshop on Generative AI for World Simulations and Communications</p></details> | None |

In particular, diffusion methods have enabled new approaches to data compression, where realistic reconstructions can be generated at extremely low bit-rates. This article provides a unifying review of recent diffusion-based methods for generative lossy compression, with a focus on image compression. These methods generally encode the source into an embedding and employ a diffusion model to iteratively refine it in the decoding procedure, such that the final reconstruction approximately follows the ground truth data distribution. The embedding can take various forms and is typically transmitted via an auxiliary entropy model, and recent methods also explore the use of diffusion models themselves for information transmission via channel simulation. We review representative approaches through the lens of rate-distortion-perception theory, highlighting the role of common randomness and connections to inverse problems, and identify open challenges.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

At its very core, CSR is about finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques, stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here, we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4 diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results, demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases, enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures; Accepted to IEEE ISBI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular, forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is more than halved on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks, while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25178v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GimmBO: Interactive Generative Image Model Merging via Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18585v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning-based adaptation is widely used to customize diffusion-based image generation, leading to large collections of community-created adapters that capture diverse subjects and styles. Adapters derived from the same base model can be merged with weights, enabling the synthesis of new visual results within a vast and continuous design space. To explore this space, current workflows rely on manual slider-based tuning, an approach that scales poorly and makes weight selection difficult, even when the candidate set is limited to 20-30 adapters. We propose GimmBO to support interactive exploration of adapter merging for image generation through Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO). Motivated by observations from real-world usage, including sparsity and constrained weight ranges, we introduce a two-stage BO backend that improves sampling efficiency and convergence in high-dimensional spaces. We evaluate our approach with simulated users and a user study, demonstrating improved convergence, high success rates, and consistent gains over BO and line-search baselines, and further show the flexibility of the framework through several extensions.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior head avatar reconstruction with rich and intricate textures compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Distillation-Enabled Knowledge Alignment for Generative Semantic Communications of AIGC Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19893v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the surging amount of AI-generated images, its provisioning to edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks. Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent representations, instead of high-dimensional image data. However, GSC relies on the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the image generation knowledge from the cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge distillation (MAKD) and condition-aware low-rank adaptation (CALA). For MAKD, an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge distillation, while CALA enables efficient adaptation to diverse rate requirements and channel conditions. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the consistency between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44% and enahnces the average transmission quality in terms of PSNR by 6.5 dB over the baselines without knowledge alignment.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community.

As an alternative, we explore pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. We evaluate VLM performance on three diverse benchmarks encompassing synthetic images of human faces, objects, and animals produced by 16 different state-of-the-art image generators. While off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these datasets, we find that prefilling responses effectively guides their reasoning -- a method we call Prefill-Guided Thinking (PGT). In particular, prefilling a VLM response with the phrase "Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts" improves the Macro F1 scores of three widely used open-source VLMs by up to 24%. We analyze this improvement in detection by tracking answer confidence during response generation. For some models, prefills counteract early overconfidence -- akin to mitigating the Dunning-Kruger effect -- leading to better detection performance.</p></details> |  | None |

The RemEdit diffusion-based framework addresses this trade-off with two synergistic innovations. First, for editing fidelity, we navigate the latent space as a Riemannian manifold. A mamba-based module efficiently learns the manifold's structure, enabling direct and accurate geodesic path computation for smooth semantic edits. This control is further refined by a dual-SLERP blending technique and a goal-aware prompt enrichment pass from a Vision-Language Model. Second, for additional acceleration, we introduce a novel task-specific attention pruning mechanism. A lightweight pruning head learns to retain tokens essential to the edit, enabling effective optimization without the semantic degradation common in content-agnostic approaches. RemEdit surpasses prior state-of-the-art editing frameworks while maintaining real-time performance under 50% pruning. Consequently, RemEdit establishes a new benchmark for practical and powerful image editing.

However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing-aware vision language model with a dynamic contrastive learning (PVLM) method for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZSDFA), which facilitates effective and fine-grained traceability to unseen advanced generators. Specifically, we conduct a novel and fine-grained ZS-DFA benchmark to evaluate the attribution performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion. Besides, we propose an innovative PVLM attributor based on the vision-language model to capture general and diverse attribution features. We are motivated by the observation that the preservation of source face attributes in facial images generated by GAN and diffusion models varies significantly. We propose to employ the inherent facial attributes preservation differences to capture face parsing-aware forgery representations. Therefore, we devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via dynamic vision-parsing matching. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center loss to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results show that our model exceeds the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA benchmark via various protocol evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |

While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Motivated by this observation, we propose Uni-RS, the first unified multimodal model tailored for remote sensing, to explicitly address the spatial asymmetry between understanding and generation. Specifically, we first introduce explicit Spatial-Layout Planning to transform textual instructions into spatial layout plans, decoupling geometric planning from visual synthesis. We then impose Spatial-Aware Query Supervision to bias learnable queries toward spatial relations explicitly specified in the instruction. Finally, we develop Image-Caption Spatial Layout Variation to expose the model to systematic geometry-consistent spatial transformations. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves spatial faithfulness in text-to-image generation, while maintaining strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks like image captioning, visual grounding, and VQA tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, modern text-to-image diffusion models struggle to generate accurate multi-food images due to object entanglement, where adjacent foods (e.g., rice and soup) fuse together because many foods do not have clear boundaries. To address this challenge, we introduce Prompt Grafting (PG), a training-free framework that combines explicit spatial cues in text with implicit layout guidance during sampling. PG runs a two-stage process where a layout prompt first establishes distinct regions and the target prompt is grafted once layout formation stabilizes. The framework enables food entanglement control: users can specify which food items should remain separated or be intentionally mixed by editing the arrangement of layouts. Across two food datasets, our method significantly improves the presence of target objects and provides qualitative evidence of controllable separation.</p></details> | Accepted by CAI2026 | None |

To address these limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following.

| **[Resolving the Identity Crisis in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-image models demonstrate impressive realism but suffer from a persistent identity crisis when generating scenes with multiple humans: producing duplicate faces, merging identities, and miscounting individuals. We present DisCo (Reinforcement with DiverSity Constraints), a novel reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes identity diversity both within images and across groups of generated samples. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by a compositional reward that: (i) penalizes facial similarity within images, (ii) discourages identity repetition across samples, (iii) enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity via human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as prompt complexity increases, requiring no additional annotations. On the DiverseHumans Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6% Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global Identity Spread, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our results establish cross-sample diversity as a critical axis for resolving identity collapse in generative models, and position DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution for multi-human image synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Ar2Can: An Architect and an Artist Leveraging a Canvas for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22690v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, existing models consistently fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals. We present Ar2Can, a novel two-stage framework that disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering for multi-human generation. The Architect module predicts structured layouts, specifying where each person should appear. The Artist module then synthesizes photorealistic images, guided by a spatially-grounded face matching reward that combines Hungarian spatial alignment with ArcFace identity similarity. This approach ensures faces are rendered at correct locations and faithfully preserve reference identities. We develop two Architect variants, seamlessly integrated with our diffusion-based Artist model and optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using compositional rewards for count accuracy, image quality, and identity matching. Evaluated on the MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves substantial improvements in both count accuracy and identity preservation, while maintaining high perceptual quality. Notably, our method achieves these results using primarily synthetic data, without requiring real multi-human images.</p></details> |  | None |

This study challenges these anthropomorphic frameworks by proposing \textbf{Machine Culture} as an emergent, distinct phenomenon. We employed a 2 (Model Origin: US vs. China) $\times$ 2 (Prompt Language: English vs. Chinese) factorial design across eight multimodal tasks, uniquely incorporating image generation and interpretation to extend analysis beyond textual boundaries. Results revealed inconsistencies with both dominant paradigms: Model origin did not predict cultural alignment, with US models frequently exhibiting ``holistic'' traits typically associated with East Asian data. Similarly, prompt language did not trigger stable cultural frame-switching; instead, we observed \textbf{Cultural Reversal}, where English prompts paradoxically elicited higher contextual attention than Chinese prompts. Crucially, we identified a novel phenomenon termed \textbf{Service Persona Camouflage}: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) collapsed cultural variance in affective tasks into a hyper-positive, zero-variance ``helpful assistant'' persona. We conclude that LLMs do not simulate human culture but exhibit an emergent Machine Culture -- a probabilistic phenomenon shaped by \textit{superposition} in high-dimensional space and \textit{mode collapse} from safety alignment.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, most existing VTON methods operate only on predefined eyewear templates and lack support for fine-grained, user-driven customization. While GlassesGAN enables personalized 2D eyewear design, its capability remains limited to 2D image generation. Motivated by the success of 3D Gaussian Blendshapes in head reconstruction, we integrate these two techniques and propose GlassesGB, a framework that supports customizable eyewear generation for 3D head avatars. GlassesGB effectively bridges 2D generative customization with 3D head avatar rendering, addressing the challenge in achieving personalized eyewear design for VR applications.

However, prior research has pointed to the high sensitivity of T2I towards particular input languages - when faced with languages other than English (i.e., different surface forms of the same prompt), T2I models often produce culturally stereotypical depictions, prioritizing the surface over the prompt's semantics. Yet a comprehensive analysis of this behavior, which we dub Surface-over-Semantics (SoS), is missing. We present the first analysis of T2I models' SoS tendencies. To this end, we create a set of prompts covering 171 cultural identities, translated into 14 languages, and use it to prompt seven T2I models. To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually. We show that all but one model exhibit strong surface-level tendency in at least two languages, with this effect intensifying across the layers of T2I text encoders. Moreover, these surface tendencies frequently correlate with stereotypical visual depictions.</p></details> |  | None |

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed to analyse spectrogram images generated from voice recordings. Three CNN architectures, VGG16, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, were evaluated across three experimental phases: training on non-augmented data, augmented data, and transfer learning. This proposed transfer learning approach involves pre-training models on the augmented dataset and fine-tuning them on the non-augmented dataset while ensuring strict data separation to prevent data leakage. The results demonstrate significant improvements in classification performance compared to the baseline approach. Among three CNN architectures, DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy of 94% and an AUC score of 99% using the proposed transfer learning approach. This finding highlights the effectiveness of combining data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance CNN-based classification of mental stability using voice spectrograms, offering a promising non-invasive tool for mental health diagnostics.</p></details> |  | None |

While this variability is central to their appeal, it challenges established HCI evaluation practices that typically assume consistent and predictable system behavior. Designing controlled lab studies under such conditions therefore remains a key methodological challenge. We present a reflective multi-case analysis of four lab-based user studies with GenAI-integrated prototypes, spanning conversational in-car assistant systems and image generation tools for design workflows. Through cross-case reflection and thematic analysis across all study phases, we identify five methodological challenges and propose eighteen practice-oriented recommendations, organized into five guidelines. These challenges represent methodological constructs that are either amplified, redefined, or newly introduced by GenAI's stochastic nature: (C1) reliance on familiar interaction patterns, (C2) fidelity-control trade-offs, (C3) feedback and trust, (C4) gaps in usability evaluation, and (C5) interpretive ambiguity between interface and system issues. Our guidelines address these challenges through strategies such as reframing onboarding to help participants manage unpredictability, extending evaluation with constructs such as trust and intent alignment, and logging system events, including hallucinations and latency, to support transparent analysis. This work contributes (1) a methodological reflection on how GenAI's stochastic nature unsettles lab-based HCI evaluation and (2) eighteen recommendations that help researchers design more transparent, robust, and comparable studies of GenAI systems in controlled settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, IUI '26 (the 31st International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces)</p></details> | None |

A central practical challenge is resolving the trade-off between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism. To address inference efficiency, many recent works have explored knowledge distillation strategies specifically tailored to SR, enabling one-step diffusion-based approaches. However, these teacher-student formulations are inherently constrained by information compression, which can degrade perceptual cues such as lifelike textures and depth of field, even with high overall perceptual quality. In parallel, self-distillation DMs, known as Flow Map models, have emerged as a promising alternative for image generation tasks, enabling fast inference while preserving the expressivity and training stability of standard DMs. Building on these developments, we propose FlowMapSR, a novel diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution explicitly designed for efficient inference. Beyond adapting Flow Map models to SR, we introduce two complementary enhancements: (i) positive-negative prompting guidance, based on a generalization of classifier free-guidance paradigm to Flow Map models, and (ii) adversarial fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Among the considered Flow Map formulations (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Shortcut), we find that the Shortcut variant consistently achieves the best performance when combined with these enhancements. Extensive experiments show that FlowMapSR achieves a better balance between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism than recent state-of-the-art methods for both x4 and x8 upscaling, while maintaining competitive inference time. Notably, a single model is used for both upscaling factors, without any scale-specific conditioning or degradation-guided mechanisms.</p></details> | Technical report | None |
| **[Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Cannot Count, and Prompt Refinement Cannot Help](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06884v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling is widely regarded as one of the most essential problems in today's AI community, with text-to-image generation having gained unprecedented real-world impacts. Among various approaches, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success and have become the de facto solution for text-to-image generation. However, despite their impressive performance, these models exhibit fundamental limitations in adhering to numerical constraints in user instructions, frequently generating images with an incorrect number of objects. While several prior works have mentioned this issue, a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of this limitation remains lacking. To address this gap, we introduce T2ICountBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the counting ability of state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse set of generative models, including both open-source and private systems. It explicitly isolates counting performance from other capabilities, provides structured difficulty levels, and incorporates human evaluations to ensure high reliability. Extensive evaluations with T2ICountBench reveal that all state-of-the-art diffusion models fail to generate the correct number of objects, with accuracy dropping significantly as the number of objects increases. Additionally, an exploratory study on prompt refinement demonstrates that such simple interventions generally do not improve counting accuracy. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges in numerical understanding within diffusion models and point to promising directions for future improvements.</p></details> |  | None |

However, intelligent attacks represented by semantic eavesdropping pose severe challenges to the security of SemCom. To address this challenge, Semantic Steganographic Communication (SemSteCom) achieves ``invisible'' encryption by implicitly embedding private semantic information into cover modality carriers. The state-of-the-art study has further introduced generative diffusion models to directly generate stega images without relying on original cover images, effectively enhancing steganographic capacity. Nevertheless, the recovery process of private images is highly dependent on the guidance of private semantic keys, which may be inferred by intelligent eavesdroppers, thereby introducing new security threats. To address this issue, we propose an Agentic AI-driven SemSteCom (AgentSemSteCom) scheme, which includes semantic extraction, digital token controlled reference image generation, coverless steganography, semantic codec, and optional task-oriented enhancement modules. The proposed AgentSemSteCom scheme obviates the need for both cover images and private semantic keys, thereby boosting steganographic capacity while reinforcing transmission security. The simulation results on open-source datasets verify that, AgentSemSteCom achieves better transmission quality and higher security levels than the baseline scheme.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures | None |

Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

However, since the DP image features are entirely determined by the camera hardware, DP-depth paired datasets are very scarce, especially when performing depth estimation on customized cameras. To overcome this, studies simulate DP images using ideal optical system models. However, these simulations often violate real optical propagation laws, leading to poor generalization to real DP data. To address this, we investigate the domain gap between simulated and real DP data, and propose solutions using the Simulating DP images from ray tracing (Sdirt) scheme. The Sdirt generates realistic DP images via ray tracing and integrates them into the depth estimation training pipeline. Experimental results show that models trained with Sdirt-simulated images generalize better to real DP data.

We introduce a novel generative image modeling framework that seamlessly bridges this gap by leveraging a diffusion model to jointly model low-level image latents (from a variational autoencoder) and high-level semantic features (from a pretrained self-supervised encoder like DINO). Our latent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature pairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and training efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard Diffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex distillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a powerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages learned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both conditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial improvements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a new direction for representation-aware generative modeling.

However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset. First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed method.

A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1,800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

While existing schemes have explored the security vulnerabilities of MLLMs, the investigation into their visual safety boundaries remains insufficient. In this paper, we propose Beyond Visual Safety (BVS), a novel image-text pair jailbreaking framework specifically designed to probe the visual safety boundaries of MLLMs. BVS employs a "reconstruction-then-generation" strategy, leveraging neutralized visual splicing and inductive recomposition to decouple malicious intent from raw inputs, thereby leading MLLMs to be induced into generating harmful images. Experimental results demonstrate that BVS achieves a remarkable jailbreak success rate of 98.21\% against GPT-5 (12 January 2026 release). Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the visual safety alignment of current MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many prominent open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as Skywork UniPic 2.0.</p></details> |  | None |

However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. We analyze these failure modes through confusion matrices and attribute them to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity. Our framework provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Controllable Layered Image Generation for Real-World Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15507v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image generation models have shown impressive progress, yet they often struggle to yield controllable and consistent results when users attempt to edit specific elements within an existing image. Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing. We demonstrate that LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects. LASAGNA-48K and LASAGNABENCH will be publicly released to foster open research in the community.

Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic interpretability techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages only minor textural details are subject to change.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 32 figures, published at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2025</p></details> | None |

Modern datasets contain samples of highly varying quality, and training directly on such heterogeneous data often yields suboptimal models. We propose a dataset-model co-evolution process; at each iteration of our method, the dataset becomes progressively higher quality, and the model improves accordingly. To avoid destructive self-consuming loops, at each generation, we treat the synthetically improved samples as noisy, but at a slightly lower noisy level than the previous iteration, and we use Ambient Diffusion techniques for learning under corruption. Empirically, Ambient Dataloops achieve state-of-the-art performance in unconditional and text-conditional image generation and de novo protein design. We further provide a theoretical justification for the proposed framework that captures the benefits of the data looping procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 9 figures, 11 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[OpenVision 3: A Family of Unified Visual Encoder for Both Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15369v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a family of advanced vision encoder, named OpenVision 3, that learns a single, unified visual representation that can serve both image understanding and image generation. Our core architecture is simple: we feed VAE-compressed image latents to a ViT encoder and train its output to support two complementary roles. First, the encoder output is passed to the ViT-VAE decoder to reconstruct the original image, encouraging the representation to capture generative structure. Second, the same representation is optimized with contrastive learning and image-captioning objectives, strengthening semantic features. By jointly optimizing reconstruction- and semantics-driven signals in a shared latent space, the encoder learns representations that synergize and generalize well across both regimes. We validate this unified design through extensive downstream evaluations with the encoder frozen. For multimodal understanding, we plug the encoder into the LLaVA-1.5 framework: it performs comparably with a standard CLIP vision encoder (e.g., 62.4 vs 62.2 on SeedBench, and 83.7 vs 82.9 on POPE). For generation, we test it under the RAE framework: ours substantially surpasses the standard CLIP-based encoder (e.g., gFID: 1.89 vs 2.54 on ImageNet). We hope this work can spur future research on unified modeling.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Iterative Refinement Improves Compositional Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15286v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

| **[Differential Privacy Image Generation with Reconstruction Loss and Noise Injection Using an Error Feedback SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15061v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional data masking techniques such as anonymization cannot achieve the expected privacy protection while ensuring data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Synthetic data plays an increasingly important role as it generates a large number of training samples and prevents information leakage in real data. The existing methods suffer from the repeating trade-off processes between privacy and utility. We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process. We generate images with higher quality and usability under the same privacy budget as the related work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both grayscale and RGB images. We achieve state-of-the-art results over almost all metrics on three benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.</p></details> |  | None |

Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic Image Synthesis via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00050v4)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in various image generation tasks compared with Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs). Recent work on semantic image synthesis mainly follows the de facto GAN-based approaches, which may lead to unsatisfactory quality or diversity of generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on DDPM for semantic image synthesis. Unlike previous conditional diffusion model directly feeds the semantic layout and noisy image as input to a U-Net structure, which may not fully leverage the information in the input semantic mask, our framework processes semantic layout and noisy image differently. It feeds noisy image to the encoder of the U-Net structure while the semantic layout to the decoder by multi-layer spatially-adaptive normalization operators. To further improve the generation quality and semantic interpretability in semantic image synthesis, we introduce the classifier-free guidance sampling strategy, which acknowledge the scores of an unconditional model for sampling process. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity (FID) and diversity (LPIPS).

This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures. Our work contributes practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of synthetic data when archaeological authenticity must be balanced with data diversity.</p></details> |  | None |

Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.</p></details> | Accpeted by ICC 2026 | None |

However, despite the inherent adversarial nature of these applications, existing evaluations rarely consider adversarial settings. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success varies significantly across targeted models. We also observe a utility-robustness trade-off: accurate attribution methods are often vulnerable to attacks and, although some techniques are robust in specific settings, none achieves robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques that balance robustness and accuracy, and we identify the most promising approaches toward this goal.

This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning "future" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark. Our study highlights that visual autoregressive models need foresight.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D Space as a Scratchpad for Editable Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14602v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown that reasoning improves when intermediate thoughts are externalized into explicit workspaces, such as chain-of-thought traces or tool-augmented reasoning. Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation. Our results highlight a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language, but also in space.

| **[AMVICC: A Novel Benchmark for Cross-Modal Failure Mode Profiling for VLMs and IGMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17037v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigated visual reasoning limitations of both multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models (IGMs) by creating a novel benchmark to systematically compare failure modes across image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, enabling cross-modal evaluation of visual understanding. Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks. This work lays the foundation for future cross-modal alignment studies, offering a framework to probe whether generation and interpretation failures stem from shared limitations to guide future improvements in unified vision-language modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures.

However, little is known about the characteristics of these GenAI-based chatbots and their user interactions. Drawing on the functional theory of NSFW on social media, this study analyzes 376 NSFW chatbots and 307 public conversation sessions on FlowGPT. Findings identify four chatbot types: roleplay characters, story generators, image generators, and do-anything-now bots. AI Characters portraying fantasy personas and enabling hangout-style interactions are most common, often using explicit avatar images to invite engagement. Sexual, violent, and insulting content appears in both user prompts and chatbot outputs, with some chatbots generating explicit material even when users do not create erotic prompts. In sum, the NSFW experience on FlowGPT can be understood as a combination of virtual intimacy, sexual delusion, violent thought expression, and unsafe content acquisition. We conclude with implications for chatbot design, creator support, user safety, and content moderation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Implicit Neural Representation Facilitates Unified Universal Vision Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14256v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models for image representation learning are typically designed for either recognition or generation. Various forms of contrastive learning help models learn to convert images to embeddings that are useful for classification, detection, and segmentation. On the other hand, models can be trained to reconstruct images with pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial losses in order to learn a latent space that is useful for image generation. We seek to unify these two directions with a first-of-its-kind model that learns representations which are simultaneously useful for recognition and generation. We train our model as a hyper-network for implicit neural representation, which learns to map images to model weights for fast, accurate reconstruction. We further integrate our INR hyper-network with knowledge distillation to improve its generalization and performance. Beyond the novel training design, the model also learns an unprecedented compressed embedding space with outstanding performance for various visual tasks. The complete model competes with state-of-the-art results for image representation learning, while also enabling generative capabilities with its high-quality tiny embeddings.

Yet their deployment is constrained by a dual bottleneck: semantic ambiguity in diverse prompts and the narrow specialization of individual models. A single diffusion architecture struggles to maintain optimal performance across heterogeneous prompts, while conventional "parse-then-call" pipelines artificially separate semantic understanding from generative execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiffusionAgent, a unified, language-model-driven agent that casts the entire "prompt comprehension-expert routing-image synthesis" loop into a agentic framework. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) a tree-of-thought-powered expert navigator that performs fine-grained semantic parsing and zero-shot matching to the most suitable diffusion model via an extensible prior-knowledge tree; (2) an advantage database updated with human-in-the-loop feedback, continually aligning model-selection policy with human aesthetic and semantic preferences; and (3) a fully decoupled agent architecture that activates the optimal generative path for open-domain prompts without retraining or fine-tuning any expert. Extensive experiments show that DiffusionAgent retains high generation quality while significantly broadening prompt coverage, establishing a new performance and generality benchmark for multi-domain image synthesis.

While text-to-image datasets are abundant, data available for instruction-based image-to-image tasks like object addition and removal is limited. This is because of the several challenges associated with the data generation process, such as, significant human effort, limited automation, suboptimal end-to-end models, data diversity constraints and high expenses. We propose an automated data generation pipeline aimed at alleviating such limitations, and introduce GalaxyEdit - a large-scale image editing dataset for add and remove operations. We fine-tune the SD v1.5 model on our dataset and find that our model can successfully handle a broader range of objects and complex editing instructions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in FID scores by 11.2\% and 26.1\% for add and remove tasks respectively. Furthermore, in light of on-device usage scenarios, we expand our research to include task-specific lightweight adapters leveraging the ControlNet-xs architecture. While ControlNet-xs excels in canny and depth guided generation, we propose to improve the communication between the control network and U-Net for more intricate add and remove tasks. We achieve this by enhancing ControlNet-xs with non-linear interaction layers based on Volterra filters. Our approach outperforms ControlNet-xs in both add/remove and canny-guided image generation tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Paired Image Generation with Diffusion-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14833v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions, which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges. First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second, existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method. The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions. Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

To address this, linear attention mechanisms have been adopted to reduce computational cost; unfortunately, the resulting linear diffusion transformers (LiTs) models often come at the expense of generative performance, frequently producing over-smoothed attention weights that limit expressiveness. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Differential Linear Attention (DyDiLA), a novel linear attention formulation that enhances the effectiveness of LiTs by mitigating the oversmoothing issue and improving generation quality. Specifically, the novelty of DyDiLA lies in three key designs: (i) dynamic projection module, which facilitates the decoupling of token representations by learning with dynamically assigned knowledge; (ii) dynamic measure kernel, which provides a better similarity measurement to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between tokens by dynamically assigning kernel functions for token processing; and (iii) token differential operator, which enables more robust query-to-key retrieval by calculating the differences between the tokens and their corresponding information redundancy produced by dynamic measure kernel. To capitalize on DyDiLA, we introduce a refined LiT, termed DyDi-LiT, that systematically incorporates our advancements. Extensive experiments show that DyDi-LiT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple metrics, underscoring its strong practical potential.</p></details> |  | None |

Object detectors may miss targets or return multiple plausible detections, and simple geometric tests can become ambiguous in borderline cases. Spatial evaluation is naturally a selective prediction problem, the checker may abstain when evidence is weak and report confidence so that results can be interpreted as a risk coverage tradeoff rather than a single score. We introduce SpatialBench-UC, a small, reproducible benchmark for pairwise spatial relations. The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models. We also include a lightweight human audit used to calibrate the checker's abstention margin and confidence threshold. We evaluate three baselines, Stable Diffusion 1.5, SD 1.5 BoxDiff, and SD 1.4 GLIGEN. The checker reports pass rate and coverage as well as conditional pass rates on decided samples. The results show that grounding methods substantially improve both pass rate and coverage, while abstention remains a dominant factor due mainly to missing detections.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, includes figures and tables</p></details> | None |

Existing safety defenses typically intervene internally within the generative model, but suffer from severe concept entanglement, leading to degradation of benign generation quality, a trade-off we term the Safety Tax. To overcome this limitation, we advocate a paradigm shift from destructive internal editing to external safety rectification. Following this principle, we propose SafePatch, a structurally isolated safety module that performs external, interpretable rectification without modifying the base model. The core backbone of SafePatch is architecturally instantiated as a trainable clone of the base model's encoder, allowing it to inherit rich semantic priors and maintain representation consistency. To enable interpretable safety rectification, we construct a strictly aligned counterfactual safety dataset (ACS) for differential supervision training. Across nudity and multi-category benchmarks and recent adversarial prompt attacks, SafePatch achieves robust unsafe suppression (7% unsafe on I2P) while preserving image quality and semantic alignment.</p></details> |  | None |

A fundamental limitation remains \textit{the curse of diversity collapse}, where the objective formulation and optimization landscape inherently collapse the policy to a Dirac delta distribution. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}ive\textbf{R}sity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Reinforcement \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning for Versatile Image Generation), an innovative framework that systematically incentivizes output diversity throughout the on-policy fine-tuning process, reconciling strong task alignment with high generation diversity to enhance versatility essential for applications that demand diverse candidate generations. We approach the problem across three representative perspectives: i) \textbf{sampling} a reward-concentrated subset that filters out reward outliers to prevent premature collapse; ii) \textbf{prompting} with stochastic variations to expand the conditioning space, and iii) \textbf{optimization} of the intra-group diversity with a potential-based reward shaping mechanism. Experimental results show that DRIFT achieves superior Pareto dominance regarding task alignment and generation diversity, yielding a $ 9.08\%\!\sim\! 43.46\%$ increase in diversity at equivalent alignment levels and a $ 59.65\% \!\sim\! 65.86\%$ increase in alignment at equivalent levels of diversity.</p></details> |  | None |

However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'26 (round 1)</p></details> | None |

However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to red-team the protective perturbation to break the protection but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic red-teaming framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic content in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a thorough evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its advantages over existing purification methods and its robustness against adaptive perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/DiffShortcut</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/DiffShortcut) |

Despite their success, these models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation, and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities -- such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Typically operating in a black-box manner, it employs an encoder-decoder framework for watermark embedding and extraction. While existing research has focused primarily on the encoders for the robustness to resist various attacks, the decoders have been largely overlooked, leading to attacks against the watermark. In this paper, we identify one such attack against the decoder, where query responses are utilized to obtain backpropagated gradients to train a watermark remover. To address this issue, we propose Decoder Gradient Shields (DGSs), a family of defense mechanisms, including DGS at the output (DGS-O), at the input (DGS-I), and in the layers (DGS-L) of the decoder, with a closed-form solution for DGS-O and provable performance for all DGS. Leveraging the joint design of reorienting and rescaling of the gradients from watermark channel gradient leaking queries, the proposed DGSs effectively prevent the watermark remover from achieving training convergence to the desired low-loss value, while preserving image quality of the decoder output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DGSs in diverse application scenarios. Our experimental results on deraining and image generation tasks with the state-of-the-art box-free watermarking show that our DGSs achieve a defense success rate of 100% under all settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, visual autoregressive models (VARs) have recently shown impressive image generation capability, but their adoption for pixel-level discriminative tasks remains limited due to weak controllability, suboptimal dense prediction performance and exposure bias. We introduce RemoteVAR, a new VAR-based change detection framework that addresses these limitations by conditioning autoregressive prediction on multi-resolution fused bi-temporal features via cross-attention, and by employing an autoregressive training strategy designed specifically for change map prediction. Extensive experiments on standard change detection benchmarks show that RemoteVAR delivers consistent and significant improvements over strong diffusion-based and transformer-based baselines, establishing a competitive autoregressive alternative for remote sensing change detection.

Unlike datacenter GPUs, consumer GPUs serve single-user, rapidly changing workloads, and each model's working set often nearly fills the GPU memory. As a result, existing sharing mechanisms (e.g., NVIDIA Unified Virtual Memory) perform poorly due to memory thrashing and excessive use of CPU pinned memory when multiple applications are active. We design and implement Nixie, a system that enables efficient and transparent temporal multiplexing on consumer GPUs without requiring any application or driver changes. Nixie is a system service that coordinates GPU memory allocation and kernel launch behavior to efficiently utilize the CPU-GPU bi-directional bandwidth and CPU pinned memory. A lightweight scheduler in Nixie further improves responsiveness by automatically prioritizing latency-sensitive interactive jobs using MLFQ-inspired techniques. Our evaluations show that Nixie improves latency of real interactive code-completion tasks by up to $3.8\times$ and saves up to 66.8% CPU pinned memory usage given the same latency requirement.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit (stated) as well as implicit (unstated, implied by the prompt's cultural context) cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we show that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, provide a concrete testbed, and outline actionable directions for developing culturally informed T2I models and metrics that improve global usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> | None |

In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of six frontier models--GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5--assessing each across language, vision-language, and image generation using a unified protocol that combines benchmark, adversarial, multilingual, and compliance evaluations. By aggregating results into safety leaderboards and model profiles, we reveal a highly uneven safety landscape: while GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced performance, other models exhibit clear trade-offs across benchmark safety, adversarial robustness, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Despite strong results under standard benchmarks, all models remain highly vulnerable under adversarial testing, with worst-case safety rates dropping below 6%. Text-to-image models show slightly stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain fragile when faced with adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these findings highlight that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation design--underscoring the need for standardized, holistic safety assessments to better reflect real-world risk and guide responsible deployment.</p></details> | 41 pages, 22 figures | None |
| **[Generation of Chest CT pulmonary Nodule Images by Latent Diffusion Models using the LIDC-IDRI Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11085v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed to support diagnosis, but their performance depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to collect the large amount of CT images for specific cases, such as small cell carcinoma with low epidemiological incidence or benign tumors that are difficult to distinguish from malignant ones. This leads to the challenge of data imbalance. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a method to automatically generate chest CT nodule images that capture target features using latent diffusion models (LDM) and verified its effectiveness. Using the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we created pairs of nodule images and finding-based text prompts based on physician evaluations. For the image generation models, we used Stable Diffusion version 1.5 (SDv1) and 2.0 (SDv2), which are types of LDM. Each model was fine-tuned using the created dataset. During the generation process, we adjusted the guidance scale (GS), which indicates the fidelity to the input text. Both quantitative and subjective evaluations showed that SDv2 (GS = 5) achieved the best performance in terms of image quality, diversity, and text consistency. In the subjective evaluation, no statistically significant differences were observed between the generated images and real images, confirming that the quality was equivalent to real clinical images. We proposed a method for generating chest CT nodule images based on input text using LDM. Evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method could generate high-quality images that successfully capture specific medical features.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Aesthetics as Structural Harm: Algorithmic Lookism Across Text-to-Image Generation and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11651v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines algorithmic lookism-the systematic preferential treatment based on physical appearance-in text-to-image (T2I) generative AI and a downstream gender classification task. Through the analysis of 26,400 synthetic faces created with Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium, we demonstrate how generative AI models systematically associate facial attractiveness with positive attributes and vice-versa, mirroring socially constructed biases rather than evidence-based correlations. Furthermore, we find significant gender bias in three gender classification algorithms depending on the attributes of the input faces. Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism. These convergent patterns reveal algorithmic lookism as systematic infrastructure operating across AI vision systems, compounding existing inequalities through both representation and recognition. Disclaimer: This work includes visual and textual content that reflects stereotypical associations between physical appearance and socially constructed attributes, including gender, race, and traits associated with social desirability. Any such associations found in this study emerge from the biases embedded in generative AI systems-not from empirical truths or the authors' views.</p></details> | 22 pages, 15 figures | None |

Existing serving systems use fixed degree sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO attainment. In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically adjust the degree of parallelism of individual requests according to their deadlines. We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2) adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and (3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.</p></details> | 42 pages, 24 figures | None |
| **[Think-Then-Generate: Reasoning-Aware Text-to-Image Diffusion with LLM Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10332v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models via Intermediate Distribution Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02692v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs KL regularized reward maximization with reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation.

With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures | None |

In this work, we propose to learn adaptive inclusive tokens to shift the attribute distribution of the final generative outputs. Unlike existing de-biasing approaches, our method requires neither explicit attribute specification nor prior knowledge of the bias distribution. Specifically, the core of our method is a lightweight adaptive mapping network, which can customize the inclusive tokens for the concepts to be de-biased, making the tokens generalizable to unseen concepts regardless of their original bias distributions. This is achieved by tuning the adaptive mapping network with a handful of balanced and inclusive samples using an anchor loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous bias mitigation methods without attribute specification while preserving the alignment between generative results and text descriptions. Moreover, our method achieves comparable performance to models that require specific attributes or editing directions for generation. Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of our adaptive inclusive tokens in mitigating stereotypical bias in text-to-image generation.

Algorithmic forgetting, or machine unlearning, seeks to remove the influence of specific data from trained models to prevent memorization of sensitive information and the generation of harmful content, yet existing exact and approximate unlearning schemes incur prohibitive programming overheads on RM hardware owing to device variability and iterative write-verify cycles. Analogue implementations of continual learning face similar barriers. Here we present a hardware-software co-design that enables an efficient training, deployment and inference pipeline for machine unlearning and continual learning on RM accelerators. At the software level, we introduce a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) framework that confines updates to compact parameter branches, substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters and therefore the training cost. At the hardware level, we develop a hybrid analogue-digital compute-in-memory system in which well-trained weights are stored in analogue RM arrays, whereas dynamic LoRA updates are implemented in a digital computing unit with SRAM buffer. This hybrid architecture avoids costly reprogramming of analogue weights and maintains high energy efficiency during inference. Fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS process, the prototype achieves up to a 147.76-fold reduction in training cost, a 387.95-fold reduction in deployment overhead and a 48.44-fold reduction in inference energy across privacy-sensitive tasks including face recognition, speaker authentication and stylized image generation, paving the way for secure and efficient neuromorphic intelligence at the edge.</p></details> |  | None |

Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,\textit{PhyRPR}:\textit{Phy\uline{R}eason}--\textit{Phy\uline{P}lan}--\textit{Phy\uline{R}efine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, \textit{PhyReason} uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; \textit{PhyPlan} deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and \textit{PhyRefine} injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data. First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics. Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation. Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability. Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data. The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare.</p></details> |  | None |

We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation. We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.</p></details> | Preprint | None |
| **[Annealed Relaxation of Speculative Decoding for Faster Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09212v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress in autoregressive image generation, inference remains slow due to the sequential nature of AR models and the ambiguity of image tokens, even when using speculative decoding. Recent works attempt to address this with relaxed speculative decoding but lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we establish the theoretical basis of relaxed SD and propose COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding built on two key insights. The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design. Together, these insights enable COOL-SD to generate images faster with comparable quality, or achieve better quality at similar latency. Experiments validate the effectiveness of COOL-SD, showing consistent improvements over prior methods in speed-quality trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[How Many Human Judgments Are Enough? Feasibility Limits of Human Preference Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09084v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human preference evaluations are widely used to compare generative models, yet it remains unclear how many judgments are required to reliably detect small improvements. We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance. Our results show that inconclusive or negative human evaluation outcomes frequently reflect underpowered evaluation rather than model equivalence, underscoring the need to account explicitly for effect size, budget, and protocol design.</p></details> |  | None |

Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often rely on model-specific features, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Cue Aggregation Network (MCAN), a novel framework that integrates different yet complementary cues in a unified network. MCAN employs a mixture-of-encoders adapter to dynamically process these cues, enabling more adaptive and robust feature representation. Our cues include the input image itself, which represents the overall content, and high-frequency components that emphasize edge details. Additionally, we introduce a Chromatic Inconsistency (CI) cue, which normalizes intensity values and captures noise information introduced during the image acquisition process in real images, making these noise patterns more distinguishable from those in AI-generated content. Unlike prior methods, MCAN's novelty lies in its unified multi-cue aggregation framework, which integrates spatial, frequency-domain, and chromaticity-based information for enhanced representation learning. These cues are intrinsically more indicative of real images, enhancing cross-model generalization. Extensive experiments on the GenImage, Chameleon, and UniversalFakeDetect benchmark validate the state-of-the-art performance of MCAN. In the GenImage dataset, MCAN outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by up to 7.4% in average ACC across eight different image generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability.

Recent techniques, such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, improve visual fidelity; however, such techniques usually struggle with mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depth. This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. This novel model is termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN). The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability, by reducing mode collapse as well as preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality. Finally, the two techniques of dropout and spectral normalization are utilized in both the generator and discriminator structures to further mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting. These findings confirm that the IGAN model potentially balances training stability with image generation quality, constituting a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[UM-Text: A Unified Multimodal Model for Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08321v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of image generation, visual text editing using natural language instructions has received increasing attention. The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, a large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MixGRPO: Unlocking Flow-based GRPO Efficiency with Mixed ODE-SDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21802v3)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO and DanceGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for faster sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use. Together, these contributions enable scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models for deployment on diverse hardware.</p></details> | Project page: | None |

However, current RL training for flow models still has two main problems: (i) GRPO-style fixed per-prompt group sizes ignore variation in sampling importance across prompts, which leads to inefficient sampling and slower training; and (ii) trajectory-level advantages are reused as per-step estimates, which biases credit assignment along the flow. We propose SuperFlow, an RL training framework for flow-based models that adjusts group sizes with variance-aware sampling and computes step-level advantages in a way that is consistent with continuous-time flow dynamics. Empirically, SuperFlow reaches promising performance while using only 5.4% to 56.3% of the original training steps and reduces training time by 5.2% to 16.7% without any architectural changes. On standard text-to-image (T2I) tasks, including text rendering, compositional image generation, and human preference alignment, SuperFlow improves over SD3.5-M by 4.6% to 47.2%, and over Flow-GRPO by 1.7% to 16.0%.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yuci-gpt.github.io/TAG-MoE/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yuci-gpt.github.io/TAG-MoE) |

Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU/MHLA/ Project website: https://dagroup-pku.github.io/MHLA/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU/MHLA) |

Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation. This study not only reveals the key weaknesses of VLMs, but also provides diagnostic tools and research directions for the development of robust models with real visual semantic reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions. Building on these designs, we present an extended version, DyDiT++, with improvements in three key aspects. First, it extends the generation mechanism of DyDiT beyond diffusion to flow matching, demonstrating that our method can also accelerate flow-matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT++. Remarkably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our approach reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, yielding 1.73x realistic speedup on hardware, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet.

FlexVAR facilitates autoregressive learning with ground-truth prediction, enabling each step to independently produce plausible images. This simple, intuitive approach swiftly learns visual distributions and makes the generation process more flexible and adaptable. Trained solely on low-resolution images ($\leq$ 256px), FlexVAR can: (1) Generate images of various resolutions and aspect ratios, even exceeding the resolution of the training images. (2) Support various image-to-image tasks, including image refinement, in/out-painting, and image expansion. (3) Adapt to various autoregressive steps, allowing for faster inference with fewer steps or enhancing image quality with more steps. Our 1.0B model outperforms its VAR counterpart on the ImageNet 256$\times$256 benchmark. Moreover, when zero-shot transfer the image generation process with 13 steps, the performance further improves to 2.08 FID, outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive models AiM/VAR by 0.25/0.28 FID and popular diffusion models LDM/DiT by 1.52/0.19 FID, respectively. When transferring our 1.0B model to the ImageNet 512$\times$512 benchmark in a zero-shot manner, FlexVAR achieves competitive results compared to the VAR 2.3B model, which is a fully supervised model trained at 512$\times$512 resolution.</p></details> |  | None |

GenDet establishes a conditional generation architecture built upon the large-scale pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, formulating the detection task as semantic constraints within the latent space. It enables precise control over bounding box positions and category attributes, while preserving the flexibility of the generative model. This novel methodology effectively bridges the gap between generative models and discriminative tasks, providing a fresh perspective for constructing unified visual understanding systems. Systematic experiments demonstrate that GenDet achieves competitive accuracy compared to discriminative detectors, while retaining the flexibility characteristic of generative methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior decentralized baseline.</p></details> |  | None |

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches often depend on task-specific retraining or expensive inversion procedures, which can compromise content integrity, reduce style fidelity, and lead to an unsatisfactory trade-off between semantic prompt adherence and style alignment. In this work, we introduce a training-free framework that reformulates style-guided synthesis as an in-context learning task. Guided by textual semantic prompts, our method concatenates a reference style image with a masked target image, leveraging a pretrained ReFlow-based inpainting model to seamlessly integrate semantic content with the desired style through multimodal attention fusion. We further analyze the imbalance and noise sensitivity inherent in multimodal attention fusion and propose a Dynamic Semantic-Style Integration (DSSI) mechanism that reweights attention between textual semantic and style visual tokens, effectively resolving guidance conflicts and enhancing output coherence. Experiments show that our approach achieves high-fidelity stylization with superior semantic-style balance and visual quality, offering a simple yet powerful alternative to complex, artifact-prone prior methods.</p></details> |  | None |

We identify two mechanistic causes: variance hijacking, where reward dispersion induces implicit reweighting that dominates the normalized training signal, and gradient conflicts, where competing objectives produce opposing update directions and trigger seesaw-like oscillations. We propose APEX (Adaptive Priority-based Efficient X-objective Alignment), which stabilizes heterogeneous rewards with Dual-Stage Adaptive Normalization and dynamically schedules objectives via P^3 Adaptive Priorities that combine learning potential, conflict penalty, and progress need. On Stable Diffusion 3.5, APEX achieves improved Pareto trade-offs across four heterogeneous objectives, with balanced gains of +1.31 PickScore, +0.35 DeQA, and +0.53 Aesthetics while maintaining competitive OCR accuracy, mitigating the instability of multi-objective alignment.</p></details> |  | None |

In PixelArena, we propose using semantic segmentation tasks to objectively examine their fine-grained generative intelligence with pixel precision. With our benchmark and experiments, we find the latest Gemini 3 Pro Image has emergent image generation capabilities that generate semantic masks with high fidelity under zero-shot settings, showcasing visual intelligence unseen before and true generalization in new image generation tasks. We further investigate its results, compare them qualitatively and quantitatively with those of other models, and present failure cases.

In this study, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to investigate how a DiT can generate correct spatial relations between objects. We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder. When using random text embeddings, we find that the spatial-relation information is passed to image tokens through a two-stage circuit, involving two cross-attention heads that separately read the spatial relation and single-object attributes in the text prompt. When using a pretrained text encoder (T5), we find that the DiT uses a different circuit that leverages information fusion in the text tokens, reading spatial-relation and single-object information together from a single text token. We further show that, although the in-domain performance is similar for the two settings, their robustness to out-of-domain perturbations differs, potentially suggesting the difficulty of generating correct relations in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 31 pages, 23 figures | None |

Unlike diffusion models, AR models enable more efficient and controllable generation with faster inference times, making them especially suitable for data-intensive domains. Traditional 3D generative models using AR approaches often rely on ``next-token" predictions at the voxel or point level. While effective for certain applications, these methods can be restrictive and computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale 3D data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce 3D-WAG, an AR model for 3D implicit distance fields that can perform unconditional shape generation, class-conditioned and also text-conditioned shape generation. Our key idea is to encode shapes as multi-scale wavelet token maps and use a Transformer to predict the ``next higher-resolution token map" in an autoregressive manner. By redefining 3D AR generation task as ``next-scale" prediction, we reduce the computational cost of generation compared to traditional ``next-token" prediction models, while preserving essential geometric details of 3D shapes in a more structured and hierarchical manner. We evaluate 3D-WAG to showcase its benefit by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on widely used benchmarks. Our results show 3D-WAG achieves superior performance in key metrics like Coverage and MMD, generating high-fidelity 3D shapes that closely match the real data distribution.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GenCtrl -- A Formal Controllability Toolkit for Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05637v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AttriCtrl: Fine-Grained Control of Aesthetic Attribute Intensity in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02151v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently become the dominant paradigm for image generation, yet existing systems struggle to interpret and follow numeric instructions for adjusting semantic attributes. In real-world creative scenarios, especially when precise control over aesthetic attributes is required, current methods fail to provide such controllability. This limitation partly arises from the subjective and context-dependent nature of aesthetic judgments, but more fundamentally stems from the fact that current text encoders are designed for discrete tokens rather than continuous values. Meanwhile, efforts on aesthetic alignment, often leveraging reinforcement learning, direct preference optimization, or architectural modifications, primarily align models with a global notion of human preference. While these approaches improve user experience, they overlook the multifaceted and compositional nature of aesthetics, underscoring the need for explicit disentanglement and independent control of aesthetic attributes. To address this gap, we introduce AttriCtrl, a lightweight framework for continuous aesthetic intensity control in diffusion models. It first defines relevant aesthetic attributes, then quantifies them through a hybrid strategy that maps both concrete and abstract dimensions onto a unified $[0,1]$ scale. A plug-and-play value encoder is then used to transform user-specified values into model-interpretable embeddings for controllable generation. Experiments show that AttriCtrl achieves accurate and continuous control over both single and multiple aesthetic attributes, significantly enhancing personalization and diversity. Crucially, it is implemented as a lightweight adapter while keeping the diffusion model frozen, ensuring seamless integration with existing frameworks such as ControlNet at negligible computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MoGen: A Unified Collaborative Framework for Controllable Multi-Object Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05546v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multi-object image generation methods face difficulties in achieving precise alignment between localized image generation regions and their corresponding semantics based on language descriptions, frequently resulting in inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Clinical Text and Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, nonmedical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM pipeline centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.070. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74% and outperforms classifiers trained on images generated by prior state-of-the-art. Classifier training solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to real image training. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric pipeline enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 2025.

Speculative Decoding offers a promising avenue for acceleration, but existing approaches are limited by token-level ambiguity and lack of spatial awareness. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale Local Speculative Decoding (MuLo-SD), a novel framework that combines multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification to accelerate AR image generation. Our method leverages a low-resolution drafter paired with learned up-samplers to propose candidate image tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Crucially, we incorporate a local rejection and resampling mechanism, enabling efficient correction of draft errors by focusing on spatial neighborhoods rather than raster-scan resampling after the first rejection. We demonstrate that MuLo-SD achieves substantial speedups - up to $\mathbf{1.7\times}$ - outperforming strong speculative decoding baselines such as EAGLE-2 and LANTERN in terms of acceleration, while maintaining comparable semantic alignment and perceptual quality. These results are validated using GenEval, DPG-Bench, and FID/HPSv2 on the MS-COCO 5k validation split. Extensive ablations highlight the impact of up-sampling design, probability pooling, and local rejection and resampling with neighborhood expansion. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in speculative decoding for image synthesis, bridging the gap between efficiency and fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/mulo-sd-webpage</p></details> | [Code Link](https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/mulo-sd-webpage) |

Although recent unified multimodal models exhibit promising understanding capabilities, these strengths often fail to transfer effectively to image generation. We introduce Re-Align, a unified framework that bridges the gap between understanding and generation through structured reasoning-guided alignment. At its core lies the In-Context Chain-of-Thought (IC-CoT), a structured reasoning paradigm that decouples semantic guidance and reference association, providing clear textual target and mitigating confusion among reference images. Furthermore, Re-Align introduces an effective RL training scheme that leverages a surrogate reward to measure the alignment between structured reasoning text and the generated image, thereby improving the model's overall performance on ICGE tasks. Extensive experiments verify that Re-Align outperforms competitive methods of comparable model scale and resources on both in-context image generation and editing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, project page: https://github.com/hrz2000/realign</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/hrz2000/realign) |

Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are leading candidates for quantum generative modeling and have been applied to diverse areas, from high-energy physics to image generation. The latent style-based QGAN, relying on a classical variational autoencoder to encode the input data into a latent space and then using a style-based QGAN for data generation has been proven to be efficient for image generation or drug design, hinting at the use of far less trainable parameters than their classical counterpart to achieve comparable performance, however this advantage has never been systematically studied. We present in this work the first comprehensive experimental analysis of this advantage of QGANS applied to SAT4 image generation, obtaining an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for a quantum generator in the hybrid latent style-based QGAN architecture. Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator. This hints toward a type of quantum advantage for quantum generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

We present OnomaCompass, a web-based exploration system that links sound-symbolic onomatopoeia and visual texture representations to support early-stage material discovery. Instead of requiring users to craft precise prompts for generative AI, OnomaCompass provides two coordinated latent-space maps--one for texture images and one for onomatopoeic term--built from an authored dataset of invented onomatopoeia and corresponding textures generated via Stable Diffusion. Users can navigate both spaces, trigger cross-modal highlighting, curate findings in a gallery, and preview textures applied to objects via an image-editing model. The system also supports video interpolation between selected textures and re-embedding of extracted frames to form an emergent exploration loop. We conducted a within-subjects study with 11 participants comparing OnomaCompass to a prompt-based image-generation workflow using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image ("Nano Banana"). OnomaCompass significantly reduced workload (NASA-TLX overall, mental demand, effort, and frustration; p < .05) and increased hedonic user experience (UEQ), while usability (SUS) favored the baseline. Qualitative findings indicate that OnomaCompass helps users externalize vague sensory expectations and promotes serendipitous discovery, but also reveals interaction challenges in spatial navigation. Overall, leveraging sound symbolism as a lightweight cue offers a complementary approach to Kansei-driven material ideation beyond prompt-centric generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Image translation has recently gained attention as a strategy to address these limitations. Although Pix2Pix has been widely applied in medical image translation, its potential has not been fully explored. In this study, we propose an enhanced Pix2Pix framework that integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual Networks (SEResNet) and U-Net++ to improve image generation quality and structural fidelity. SEResNet strengthens critical feature representation through channel attention, while U-Net++ enhances multi-scale feature fusion. A simplified PatchGAN discriminator further stabilizes training and refines local anatomical realism. Experimental results demonstrate that under few-shot conditions with fewer than 500 images, the proposed method achieves consistent structural fidelity and superior image quality across multiple intra-modality MRI translation tasks, showing strong generalization ability. These results suggest an effective extension of Pix2Pix for medical image translation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Forge-and-Quench: Enhancing Image Generation for Higher Fidelity in Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04706v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating image generation and understanding into a single framework has become a pivotal goal in the multimodal domain. However, how understanding can effectively assist generation has not been fully explored. Unlike previous works that focus on leveraging reasoning abilities and world knowledge from understanding models, this paper introduces a novel perspective: leveraging understanding to enhance the fidelity and detail richness of generated images. To this end, we propose Forge-and-Quench, a new unified framework that puts this principle into practice. In the generation process of our framework, an MLLM first reasons over the entire conversational context, including text instructions, to produce an enhanced text instruction. This refined instruction is then mapped to a virtual visual representation, termed the Bridge Feature, via a novel Bridge Adapter. This feature acts as a crucial link, forging insights from the understanding model to quench and refine the generation process. It is subsequently injected into the T2I backbone as a visual guidance signal, alongside the enhanced text instruction that replaces the original input. To validate this paradigm, we conduct comprehensive studies on the design of the Bridge Feature and Bridge Adapter. Our framework demonstrates exceptional extensibility and flexibility, enabling efficient migration across different MLLM and T2I models with significant savings in training overhead, all without compromising the MLLM's inherent multimodal understanding capabilities. Experiments show that Forge-and-Quench significantly improves image fidelity and detail across multiple models, while also maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application.

Existing methods rely on Euclidean space metrics, neglecting the structured nature of semantic alignment, while lacking adaptive capabilities for different samples. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, an adaptive text-to-image alignment assessment framework based on hyperbolic entailment geometry. First, we extract Euclidean features using CLIP and map them to hyperbolic space. Second, we design a dynamic-supervision entailment modeling mechanism that transforms discrete entailment logic into continuous geometric structure supervision. Finally, we propose an adaptive modulation regressor that utilizes hyperbolic geometric features to generate sample-level modulation parameters, adaptively calibrating Euclidean cosine similarity to predict the final score. HyperAlign achieves highly competitive performance on both single database evaluation and cross-database generalization tasks, fully validating the effectiveness of hyperbolic geometric modeling for image-text alignment assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the current mainstream approach remains focused on building task-specific models, which have limited efficiency when supporting a wide range of different needs. While universal models attempt to address this limitation, they face critical challenges, including generalizable task instruction, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design. To tackle these challenges, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, which supports a wide range of in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen ones, unseen unification of multiple tasks, and reverse generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task instruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual demonstrations. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks. To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge. Furthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a consistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

Recent work has explored using vision-language models (VLMs) for planning, yet existing approaches typically treat perception, prediction, and planning as separate modules. We propose UniDrive-WM, a unified VLM-based world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and trajectory-conditioned future image generation within a single architecture. UniDrive-WM's trajectory planner predicts a future trajectory, which conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames. These predictions provide additional supervisory signals that enhance scene understanding and iteratively refine trajectory generation. We further compare discrete and continuous output representations for future image prediction, analyzing their influence on downstream driving performance. Experiments on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark show that UniDrive-WM produces high-fidelity future images and improves planning performance by 5.9% in L2 trajectory error and 9.2% in collision rate over the previous best method. These results demonstrate the advantages of tightly integrating VLM-driven reasoning, planning, and generative world modeling for autonomous driving.

However, many existing systems rely on explicit modality switching, generating reasoning text before switching manually to image generation. This separate, sequential inference process limits cross-modal coupling and prohibits automatic multimodal generation. This work explores post-training to achieve fully unified text-image generation, where models autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis within a single inference process. We examine the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training. We additionally explore different post-training data strategies, showing that a targeted dataset addressing specific limitations achieves superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data. Using offline, reward-weighted post-training with fully self-generated synthetic data, our approach enables improvements in multimodal image generation across four diverse T2I benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reward-weighting both modalities and strategically designed post-training data.</p></details> |  | None |

While Masked Language Models (MLMs) offer efficient bidirectional context, they traditionally lack the generative fidelity of autoregressive models and the semantic continuity of diffusion models. Furthermore, extending masked generation to multimodal settings introduces severe alignment challenges and training instability. In this work, we propose \textbf{CoM-DAD} (\textbf{Co}upled \textbf{M}anifold \textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{A}bsorbing \textbf{D}iffusion), a novel probabilistic framework that reformulates multimodal generation as a hierarchical dual-process. CoM-DAD decouples high-level semantic planning from low-level token synthesis. First, we model the semantic manifold via a continuous latent diffusion process; second, we treat token generation as a discrete absorbing diffusion process, regulated by a \textbf{Variable-Rate Noise Schedule}, conditioned on these evolving semantic priors. Crucially, we introduce a \textbf{Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport} strategy that aligns disparate modalities without requiring heavy contrastive dual-encoders. Our method demonstrates superior stability over standard masked modeling, establishing a new paradigm for scalable, unified text-image generation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, a key obstacle for diffusion transformers in addressing this problem is the mismatch between positional encodings seen at inference and those used during training. Existing strategies such as positional encodings interpolation, extrapolation, or hybrids, do not fully resolve this mismatch. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional randomized positional encodings, namely RPE-2D, that prioritizes the order of image patches rather than their absolute distances, enabling seamless high- and low-resolution generation without training on multiple resolutions. Concretely, RPE-2D independently samples positions along the horizontal and vertical axes over an expanded range during training, ensuring that the encodings used at inference lie within the training distribution and thereby improving resolution generalization. We further introduce a simple random resize-and-crop augmentation to strengthen order modeling and add micro-conditioning to indicate the applied cropping pattern. On the ImageNet dataset, RPE-2D achieves state-of-the-art resolution generalization performance, outperforming competitive methods when trained at $256^2$ and evaluated at $384^2$ and $512^2$, and when trained at $512^2$ and evaluated at $768^2$ and $1024^2$.

However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring "vision" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

We present FairT2I, a training-free and interactive framework grounded in a mathematically principled latent variable guidance formulation. This formulation decomposes the generative score function into attribute-conditioned components and reweights them according to a defined distribution, providing a unified and flexible mechanism for bias-aware generation that also subsumes many existing ad hoc debiasing approaches as special cases. Building upon this foundation, FairT2I incorporates (1) latent variable guidance as the core mechanism, (2) LLM-based bias detection to automatically infer bias-prone categories and attributes from text prompts as part of the latent structure, and (3) attribute resampling, which allows users to adjust or redefine the attribute distribution based on uniform, real-world, or user-specified statistics. The accompanying user interface supports this pipeline by enabling users to inspect detected biases, modify attributes or weights, and generate debiased images in real time. Experimental results show that LLMs outperform average human annotators in the number and granularity of detected bias categories and attributes. Moreover, FairT2I achieves superior performance to baseline models in both societal bias mitigation and image diversity, while preserving image quality and prompt fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GeoDiff-SAR: A Geometric Prior Guided Diffusion Model for SAR Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03499v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging results are highly sensitive to observation geometries and the geometric parameters of targets. However, existing generative methods primarily operate within the image domain, neglecting explicit geometric information. This limitation often leads to unsatisfactory generation quality and the inability to precisely control critical parameters such as azimuth angles. To address these challenges, we propose GeoDiff-SAR, a geometric prior guided diffusion model for high-fidelity SAR image generation. Specifically, GeoDiff-SAR first efficiently simulates the geometric structures and scattering relationships inherent in real SAR imaging by calculating SAR point clouds at specific azimuths, which serves as a robust physical guidance. Secondly, to effectively fuse multi-modal information, we employ a feature fusion gating network based on Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to dynamically regulate the weight distribution of 3D physical information, image control parameters, and textual description parameters. Thirdly, we utilize the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) architecture to perform lightweight fine-tuning on the advanced Stable Diffusion 3.5 (SD3.5) model, enabling it to rapidly adapt to the distribution characteristics of the SAR domain. To validate the effectiveness of GeoDiff-SAR, extensive comparative experiments were conducted on real-world SAR datasets. The results demonstrate that data generated by GeoDiff-SAR exhibits high fidelity and effectively enhances the accuracy of downstream classification tasks. In particular, it significantly improves recognition performance across different azimuth angles, thereby underscoring the superiority of physics-guided generation.</p></details> | 22 pages, 17 figures | None |

However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these, we propose LAMS-Edit, leveraging intermediate states from the inversion process--an essential step in real-image editing--during edited image generation. Specifically, latent representations and attention maps from both processes are combined at each step using weighted interpolation, controlled by a scheduler. This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMS-Edit effectively balances content preservation and edit application.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing VTON models often suffer from artifacts such as garment distortion and body inconsistency, highlighting the need for reliable quality evaluation of VTON-generated images. To this end, we construct VTONQA, the first multi-dimensional quality assessment dataset specifically designed for VTON, which contains 8,132 images generated by 11 representative VTON models, along with 24,396 mean opinion scores (MOSs) across three evaluation dimensions (i.e., clothing fit, body compatibility, and overall quality). Based on VTONQA, we benchmark both VTON models and a diverse set of image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, revealing the limitations of existing methods and highlighting the value of the proposed dataset. We believe that the VTONQA dataset and corresponding benchmarks will provide a solid foundation for perceptually aligned evaluation, benefiting both the development of quality assessment methods and the advancement of VTON models.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing TTS approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i) Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3) successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in challenging scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/EnVision-Research/ScalingAR</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/EnVision-Research/ScalingAR) |

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper delves into a comparative analysis between CLIP and its recent counterpart, CLOOB. To unravel the intricate distinctions within the embedding spaces crafted by these models, we employ topological data analysis. Our approach encompasses a comprehensive examination of the modality gap drivers, the clustering structures existing across both high and low dimensions, and the pivotal role that dimension collapse plays in shaping their respective embedding spaces. Empirical experiments substantiate the implications of our analyses on downstream performance across various contextual scenarios. Through this investigation, we aim to shed light on the nuanced intricacies that underlie the comparative efficacy of CLIP and CLOOB, offering insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses, and providing a foundation for further refinement and advancement in multimodal model research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript contains substantive technical inaccuracies and an incomplete treatment of the stated topic.

This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS, 22 pages, 7 tables, 12 figures, code and models available</p></details> | None |

To address this, we advocate a hybrid architecture that achieves query awareness when serving diffusion models. Unlike existing query-aware serving systems that cascade lightweight and heavyweight models with a fixed configuration, our hybrid architecture first routes each query directly to a suitable model variant, then reroutes it to a cascaded heavyweight model only if necessary. We theoretically analyze conditions for the hybrid architecture to outperform non-hybrid alternatives in latency and response quality. Building on this architecture, we design HADIS, a hybrid serving system for latency-aware diffusion models that jointly optimizes cascade model selection, query routing, and resource allocation. To reduce the complexity of resource management, HADIS uses an offline profiling phase to produce a Pareto-optimal cascade configuration table. At runtime, HADIS selects the best cascade configuration and GPU allocation given latency and workload constraints. Empirical evaluations on real-world traces demonstrate that HADIS improves response quality by up to 35% while reducing latency violation rates by 2.7-45$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures | None |

Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.</p></details> |  | None |

To understand the internal mechanism of MMDiT-based models, existing methods tried to analyze the effect of specific components like positional encoding and attention layers. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms various baselines and remains flexible across text-to-image generation, image editing, and inference acceleration. Our method improves T2I-Combench++ from 56.92% to 63.00% and GenEval from 66.42% to 71.63% on SD3.5, without sacrificing synthesis quality. These results advance understanding of MMDiT models and provide valuable insights to unlock new possibilities for further improvements.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |

Existing refinement approaches either perform costly iterative re-generation or rely on vision-language models (VLMs) with weak spatial grounding, leading to semantic drift and unreliable local edits. To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. This design integrates perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified, self-corrective decision process. To enable fine-grained supervision and quantitative evaluation, we further construct GenBlemish-27K, a dataset of 6K T2I images with 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Agentic Retoucher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality, distortion localization and human preference alignment, establishing a new paradigm for self-corrective and perceptually reliable T2I generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often rely on lightweight modules for fast feature extraction, which struggles to preserve structured patterns and fine-grained details, leading to texture attenuation during generation.To address these issues, we propose AlignVTOFF, a novel parallel U-Net framework built upon a Reference U-Net and Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment (TSFA). The Reference U-Net performs multi-scale feature extraction and enhances geometric fidelity, enabling robust modeling of deformation while retaining complex structured patterns. TSFA then injects the reference garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net via a hybrid attention design, consisting of a trainable cross-attention module and a frozen self-attention module. This design explicitly aligns texture and spatial cues and alleviates the loss of high-frequency information during the denoising process.Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate that AlignVTOFF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing flat-lay garment results with improved structural realism and high-frequency detail fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts.

| **[Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09040v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks.

To ensure the security of communication systems, encryption techniques are employed to safeguard confidentiality and integrity. However, existing encryption schemes encounter obstacles when applied to SemCom. To address this issue, this paper explores the feasibility of applying homomorphic encryption (HE) to SemCom. Initially, we review the encryption algorithms utilized in mobile communication systems and analyze the challenges associated with their application to SemCom. Subsequently, we overview HE techniques and employ scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to demonstrate that the extractable semantic information can be preserved in homomorphic encrypted ciphertext. Based on this finding, we further propose the HE-joint source-channel coding (HE-JSCC) scheme, where the traditional JSCC model architecture is modified to support HE operations. Moreover, we present the simulation results for image classification and image generation tasks. Furthermore, we provide potential future research directions for homomorphic encrypted SemCom.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

This flexible tokenization is typically achieved through nested dropout, where a portion of trailing tokens is randomly truncated during training, and the image is reconstructed using the remaining preceding sequence. However, this tail-truncation strategy inherently concentrates the image information in the early tokens, limiting the effectiveness of downstream AutoRegressive (AR) image generation as the token length increases. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{ReToK}, a flexible tokenizer with \underline{Re}dundant \underline{Tok}en Padding and Hierarchical Semantic Regularization, designed to fully exploit all tokens for enhanced latent modeling. Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Redundant Token Padding} to activate tail tokens more frequently, thereby alleviating information over-concentration in the early tokens. In addition, we apply \textbf{Hierarchical Semantic Regularization} to align the decoding features of earlier tokens with those from a pre-trained vision foundation model, while progressively reducing the regularization strength toward the tail to allow finer low-level detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReTok: on ImageNet 256$\times$256, our method achieves superior generation performance compared with both flexible and fixed-length tokenizers.

However, a common challenge arises when working with medical images generated by different systems or even the same system with different parameter settings. Such images contain diverse textures and reverberation noise that violate the aforementioned assumption. Consequently, models trained on data from one device or setting often struggle to perform effectively with data from other devices or settings. In addition, retraining models for each specific device or setting is labor-intensive and costly. To address these issues in ultrasound images, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model. We formulated the domain adaptation tasks as an image-to-image translation task, in which we modified the texture patterns and removed reverberation noise in the test data images from the source domain to align with those in the target domain images while keeping the image content unchanged. We applied the proposed method to two datasets containing carotid ultrasound images from three different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully translated the texture pattern of images and removed reverberation noise from the ultrasound images. Furthermore, we evaluated the CycleGAN approaches for a comparative study with the proposed model. The experimental findings conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model achieved domain adaptation (histogram correlation (0.960 (0.019), & 0.920 (0.043) and bhattacharya distance (0.040 (0.020), & 0.085 (0.048)), compared to no adaptation (0.916 (0.062) & 0.890 (0.077), 0.090 (0.070) & 0.121 (0.095)) for both datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

This work presents a hybrid CMOS-spintronic deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) architecture for synthetic image generation. The proposed generative vision model approach follows the standard framework, leveraging generator and discriminators adversarial training with our designed spintronics hardware for deconvolution, convolution, and activation layers of the DCGAN architecture. To enable hardware aware spintronic implementation, the generator's deconvolution layers are restructured as zero padded convolution, allowing seamless integration with a 6-bit skyrmion based synapse in a crossbar, without compromising training performance. Nonlinear activation functions are implemented using a hybrid CMOS domain wall based Rectified linear unit (ReLU) and Leaky ReLU units. Our proposed tunable Leaky ReLU employs domain wall position coded, continuous resistance states and a piecewise uniaxial parabolic anisotropy profile with a parallel MTJ readout, exhibiting energy consumption of 0.192 pJ. Our spintronic DCGAN model demonstrates adaptability across both grayscale and colored datasets, achieving Fr'echet Inception Distances (FID) of 27.5 for the Fashion MNIST and 45.4 for Anime Face datasets, with testing energy (training energy) of 4.9 nJ (14.97~nJ/image) and 24.72 nJ (74.7 nJ/image).</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Improved Object-Centric Diffusion Learning with Registers and Contrastive Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01224v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slot Attention (SA) with pretrained diffusion models has recently shown promise for object-centric learning (OCL), but suffers from slot entanglement and weak alignment between object slots and image content. We propose Contrastive Object-centric Diffusion Alignment (CODA), a simple extension that (i) employs register slots to absorb residual attention and reduce interference between object slots, and (ii) applies a contrastive alignment loss to explicitly encourage slot-image correspondence. The resulting training objective serves as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information (MI) between slots and inputs, strengthening slot representation quality. On both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO), CODA improves object discovery (e.g., +6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation over strong baselines. Register slots add negligible overhead, keeping CODA efficient and scalable. These results indicate potential applications of CODA as an effective framework for robust OCL in complex, real-world scenes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neural Networks on Symmetric Spaces of Noncompact Type](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01097v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have demonstrated promising performances of neural networks on hyperbolic spaces and symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds. These spaces belong to a family of Riemannian manifolds referred to as symmetric spaces of noncompact type. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for developing neural networks on such spaces. Our approach relies on a unified formulation of the distance from a point to a hyperplane on the considered spaces. We show that some existing formulations of the point-to-hyperplane distance can be recovered by our approach under specific settings. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the point-to-hyperplane distance in higher-rank symmetric spaces of noncompact type equipped with G-invariant Riemannian metrics. The derived distance then serves as a tool to design fully-connected (FC) layers and an attention mechanism for neural networks on the considered spaces. Our approach is validated on challenging benchmarks for image classification, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification, image generation, and natural language inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contractive Diffusion Policies: Robust Action Diffusion via Contractive Score-Based Sampling with Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01003v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have emerged as powerful generative models for offline policy learning, whose sampling process can be rigorously characterized by a score function guiding a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). However, the same score-based SDE modeling that grants diffusion policies the flexibility to learn diverse behavior also incurs solver and score-matching errors, large data requirements, and inconsistencies in action generation. While less critical in image generation, these inaccuracies compound and lead to failure in continuous control settings. We introduce Contractive Diffusion Policies (CDPs) to induce contractive behavior in the diffusion sampling dynamics. Contraction pulls nearby flows closer to enhance robustness against solver and score-matching errors while reducing unwanted action variance. We develop an in-depth theoretical analysis along with a practical implementation recipe to incorporate CDPs into existing diffusion policy architectures with minimal modification and computational cost. We evaluate CDPs for offline learning by conducting extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings. Across benchmarks, CDPs often outperform baseline policies, with pronounced benefits under data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods struggle with a critical trade-off between fidelity and efficiency. Tuning-based approaches rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive, subject-specific optimization, while zero-shot methods often fail to maintain adequate subject consistency. In this work, we propose FreeGraftor, a training-free framework that addresses these limitations through cross-image feature grafting. Specifically, FreeGraftor leverages semantic matching and position-constrained attention fusion to transfer visual details from reference subjects to the generated images. Additionally, our framework introduces a novel noise initialization strategy to preserve the geometry priors of reference subjects, facilitating robust feature matching. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method enables precise subject identity transfer while maintaining text-aligned scene synthesis. Without requiring model fine-tuning or additional training, FreeGraftor significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and training-free approaches in both subject fidelity and text alignment. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly extend to multi-subject generation, making it practical for real-world deployment.

| **[Unknown Aware AI-Generated Content Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00218v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of photorealistic generative models has made it increasingly important to attribute the origin of synthetic content, moving beyond binary real or fake detection toward identifying the specific model that produced a given image. We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high. Experimental results show that incorporating wild data substantially improves attribution performance on challenging unseen generators, demonstrating that unlabeled data from the wild can be effectively exploited to enhance AI generated content attribution in open world settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GameTileNet: A Semantic Dataset for Low-Resolution Game Art in Procedural Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02941v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG) and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However, generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods, supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images. TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through visual-language alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of a paper accepted for oral presentation at AIIDE 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Are First-Order Diffusion Samplers Really Slower? A Fast Forward-Value Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24927v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime. We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.</p></details> |  | None |

With the growing prevalence of deepfake technology, which can manipulate facial features in images and videos, the potential for fraud in online transactions has escalated. Traditional security systems struggle to identify these sophisticated forms of fraud. This research proposes a novel GAN-based model that enhances online payment security by identifying subtle manipulations in payment images. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of real-world online payment images and deepfake images generated using advanced GAN architectures, such as StyleGAN and DeepFake. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately distinguish between legitimate transactions and deepfakes, achieving a high detection rate above 95%. This approach significantly improves the robustness of payment systems against AI-driven fraud. The paper contributes to the growing field of digital security, offering insights into the application of GANs for fraud detection in financial services.

| **[Geometric Disentanglement of Text Embeddings for Subject-Consistent Text-to-Image Generation using A Single Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16443v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions but often fail to preserve subject consistency across multiple outputs, limiting their use in visual storytelling. Existing approaches rely on model fine-tuning or image conditioning, which are computationally expensive and require per-subject optimization. 1Prompt1Story, a training-free approach, concatenates all scene descriptions into a single prompt and rescales token embeddings, but it suffers from semantic leakage, where embeddings across frames become entangled, causing text misalignment. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective training-free approach that addresses semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective by refining text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics. Extensive experiments prove that our approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Five scenarios were developed, and 2,060 images were generated using input prompts that specified nationalities across five activities. When aggregating across activities and models, results showed that 28.4% of the images depicted individuals wearing traditional attire, including attire that is impractical for the specified activities in several cases. This pattern was statistically significantly associated with regions, with the Middle East & North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa disproportionately affected, and was also associated with World Bank income groups. Similar region- and income-linked patterns were observed for images labeled as depicting impractical attire in two athletics-related activities. To assess image-text alignment, CLIP, ALIGN, and GPT-4.1 mini were used to score 9,270 image-prompt pairs. Images labeled as featuring traditional attire received statistically significantly higher alignment scores when prompts included country names, and this pattern weakened or reversed when country names were removed. Revised prompt analysis showed that one model frequently inserted the word "traditional" (50.3% for traditional-labeled images vs. 16.6% otherwise). These results indicate that these representational patterns can be shaped by several components of the pipeline, including image generator, evaluation models, and prompt revision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UniHetero: Could Generation Enhance Understanding for Vision-Language-Model at Large Data Scale?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23512v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language large models are moving toward the unification of visual understanding and visual generation tasks. However, whether generation can enhance understanding is still under-explored on large data scale. In this work, we analysis the unified structure with a concise model, UniHetero, under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples). Our key observations are: (1) Generation can improve understanding, but Only if you generate Semantics, Not Pixels. A common assumption in unified vision-language models is that adding generation will naturally strengthen understanding. However, this is not always true at scale. At 200M+ pretraining samples, generation helps understanding only when it operates at the semantic level, i.e. when the model learns to autoregress high-level visual representations inside the LLM. Once pixel-level objectives (e.g., diffusion losses) directly interfere with the LLM, understanding performance often degrades. (2) Generation reveals a superior Data Scaling trend and higher Data Utilization. Unified generation-understanding demonstrates a superior scaling trend compared to understanding alone, revealing a more effective way to learn vision-only knowledge directive from vision modality rather than captioning to text. (3) Autoregression on Input Embedding is effective to capture visual details. Compared to the commonly-used vision encoder, make visual autoregression on input embedding shows less cumulative error and is modality independent, which can be extend to all modalities. The learned semantic representations capture visual information such as objects, locations, shapes, and colors; further enable pixel-level image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RainFusion2.0: Temporal-Spatial Awareness and Hardware-Efficient Block-wise Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24086v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing defenses can detect many such attacks via visual inspection and neural network-based analysis, we identify a more lightweight and stealthy threat, termed BadBlocks. BadBlocks selectively contaminates specific blocks within the UNet architecture while preserving the normal behavior of the remaining components. Compared with prior methods, it requires only about 30% of the computation and 20% of the GPU time, yet achieves high attack success rates with minimal perceptual degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BadBlocks can effectively evade state-of-the-art defenses, particularly attention-based detection frameworks. Ablation studies further reveal that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the critical role of certain layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks substantially lowers the barrier for backdooring large-scale diffusion models, even on consumer-grade GPUs.</p></details> |  | None |

While research on visual emotion analysis is extensive, limited work has been done on helping users generate emotionally rich image content. Existing work on emotional image generation relies on discrete emotion categories, making it challenging to capture complex and subtle emotional nuances accurately. Additionally, these methods struggle to control the specific content of generated images based on text prompts. In this work, we introduce the new task of continuous emotional image content generation (C-EICG) and present EmotiCrafter, an emotional image generation model that generates images based on text prompts and Valence-Arousal values. Specifically, we propose a novel emotion-embedding mapping network that embeds Valence-Arousal values into textual features, enabling the capture of specific emotions in alignment with intended input prompts. Additionally, we introduce a loss function to enhance emotion expression. The experimental results show that our method effectively generates images representing specific emotions with the desired content and outperforms existing techniques.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures | None |

Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

In this work, we investigate its potential impact on the image restoration community. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic benchmark across diverse restoration scenarios. Our evaluation shows that, while the restoration results generated by GPT-Image models are often perceptually pleasant, they tend to lack pixel-level structural fidelity compared with ground-truth references. Typical deviations include changes in image geometry, object positions or counts, and even modifications in perspective. Beyond empirical observations, we further demonstrate that outputs from GPT-Image models can act as strong visual priors, offering notable performance improvements for existing restoration networks. Using dehazing, deraining, and low-light enhancement as representative case studies, we show that integrating GPT-generated priors significantly boosts restoration quality. This study not only provides practical insights and a baseline framework for incorporating GPT-based generative priors into restoration pipelines, but also highlights new opportunities for bridging image generation models and restoration tasks. To support future research, we will release GPT-restored results.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations.

We propose MESA MIG, a multi agent semantic and emotion aligned framework that first produces structured music captions and then refines them with cooperating agents specializing in scene, motion, style, color, and composition. In parallel, a Valence Arousal regression head predicts continuous affective states from music, while a CLIP based visual VA head estimates emotions from images. These components jointly enforce semantic and emotional alignment between music and synthesized images. Experiments on curated music image pairs show that MESA MIG outperforms caption only and single agent baselines in aesthetic quality, semantic consistency, and VA alignment, and achieves competitive emotion regression performance compared with state of the art music and image emotion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,3 figures.Under review for ICME 2026</p></details> | None |

We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.</p></details> |  | None |
