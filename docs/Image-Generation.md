| **[Data-Centric Visual Development for Self-Driving Labs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02018v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-driving laboratories offer a promising path toward reducing the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often irreproducible workflows in the biological sciences. Yet their stringent precision requirements demand highly robust models whose training relies on large amounts of annotated data. However, this kind of data is difficult to obtain in routine practice, especially negative samples. In this work, we focus on pipetting, the most critical and precision sensitive action in SDLs. To overcome the scarcity of training data, we build a hybrid pipeline that fuses real and virtual data generation. The real track adopts a human-in-the-loop scheme that couples automated acquisition with selective human verification to maximize accuracy with minimal effort. The virtual track augments the real data using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation, which is further screened and validated for reliability. Together, these two tracks yield a class-balanced dataset that enables robust bubble detection training. On a held-out real test set, a model trained entirely on automatically acquired real images reaches 99.6% accuracy, and mixing real and generated data during training sustains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load. Our approach offers a scalable and cost-effective strategy for supplying visual feedback data to SDL workflows and provides a practical solution to data scarcity in rare event detection and broader vision tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Generative Video Motion Editing with 3D Point Tracks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02015v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera and object motions are central to a video's narrative. However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://edit-by-track.github.io</p></details> | None |
| **[TUNA: Taming Unified Visual Representations for Native Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02014v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models (UMMs) aim to jointly perform multimodal understanding and generation within a single framework. We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. Our extensive experiments on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks show that TUNA achieves state-of-the-art results in image and video understanding, image and video generation, and image editing, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of its unified representation design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tuna-ai.org/</p></details> | None |
| **[ManualVLA: A Unified VLA Model for Chain-of-Thought Manual Generation and Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02013v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged, demonstrating strong generalization in robotic scene understanding and manipulation. However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the "how" process from the "what" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Visual Affordance from Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02005v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Audio-Visual Affordance Grounding (AV-AG), a new task that segments object interaction regions from action sounds. Unlike existing approaches that rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos, which often limited by ambiguity or occlusion, audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions. To support this task, we construct the first AV-AG dataset, comprising a large collection of action sounds, object images, and pixel-level affordance annotations. The dataset also includes an unseen subset to evaluate zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we propose AVAGFormer, a model equipped with a semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixer and a dual-head decoder that effectively fuses audio and visual signals for mask prediction. Experiments show that AVAGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on AV-AG, surpassing baselines from related tasks. Comprehensive analyses highlight the distinctions between AV-AG and AVS, the benefits of end-to-end modeling, and the contribution of each component. Code and dataset have been released on https://jscslld.github.io/AVAGFormer/.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures | [Code Link](https://jscslld.github.io/AVAGFormer) |
| **[VIVAT: Virtuous Improving VAE Training through Artifact Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07863v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SpriteHand: Real-Time Versatile Hand-Object Interaction with Autoregressive Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01960v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and synthesizing complex hand-object interactions remains a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art physics engines. Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output. Experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to both generative and engine-based baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Plane Reformatting for 4D Flow MRI using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00727v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Objective: Plane reformatting for four-dimensional phase contrast MRI (4D flow MRI) is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, which limits fast cardiovascular flow assessment. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) trains agents to iteratively adjust plane position and orientation, enabling accurate plane reformatting without the need for detailed landmarks, making it suitable for images with limited contrast and resolution such as 4D flow MRI. However, current DRL methods assume that test volumes share the same spatial alignment as the training data, limiting generalization across scanners and institutions. To address this limitation, we introduce AdaPR (Adaptive Plane Reformatting), a DRL framework that uses a local coordinate system to navigate volumes with arbitrary positions and orientations. Methods: We implemented AdaPR using the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm and validated it on 88 4D flow MRI datasets acquired from multiple vendors, including patients with congenital heart disease. Results: AdaPR achieved a mean angular error of 6.32 +/- 4.15 degrees and a distance error of 3.40 +/- 2.75 mm, outperforming global-coordinate DRL methods and alternative non-DRL methods. AdaPR maintained consistent accuracy under different volume orientations and positions. Flow measurements from AdaPR planes showed no significant differences compared to two manual observers, with excellent correlation (R^2 = 0.972 and R^2 = 0.968), comparable to inter-observer agreement (R^2 = 0.969). Conclusion: AdaPR provides robust, orientation-independent plane reformatting for 4D flow MRI, achieving flow quantification comparable to expert observers. Its adaptability across datasets and scanners makes it a promising candidate for medical imaging applications beyond 4D flow MRI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Script: Graph-Structured and Query-Conditioned Semantic Token Pruning for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01949v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of visual tokens in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) leads to excessive memory consumption and inference latency, especially when handling high-resolution images and videos. Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. Together, they enhance performance on multimodal tasks. Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, it achieves up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of the original performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research, Project in https://01yzzyu.github.io/script.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://01yzzyu.github.io/script.github.io) |
| **[Guardian: Detecting Robotic Planning and Execution Errors with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01946v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust robotic manipulation requires reliable failure detection and recovery. Although current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, their accuracy and generalization are limited by the scarcity of failure data. To address this data gap, we propose an automatic robot failure synthesis approach that procedurally perturbs successful trajectories to generate diverse planning and execution failures. This method produces not only binary classification labels but also fine-grained failure categories and step-by-step reasoning traces in both simulation and the real world. With it, we construct three new failure detection benchmarks: RLBench-Fail, BridgeDataV2-Fail, and UR5-Fail, substantially expanding the diversity and scale of existing failure datasets. We then train Guardian, a VLM with multi-view images for detailed failure reasoning and detection. Guardian achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing and newly introduced benchmarks. It also effectively improves task success rates when integrated into a state-of-the-art manipulation system in simulation and real robots, demonstrating the impact of our generated failure data.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Med-VCD: Mitigating Hallucination for Medical Large Vision Language Models through Visual Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01922v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are now central to healthcare applications such as medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. Yet, these models remain vulnerable to hallucination outputs that appear plausible but are in fact incorrect. In the natural image domain, several decoding strategies have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by reinforcing visual evidence, but most rely on secondary decoding or rollback procedures that substantially slow inference. Moreover, existing solutions are often domain-specific and may introduce misalignment between modalities or between generated and ground-truth content. We introduce Med-VCD, a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time overhead of secondary decoding. Med-VCD incorporates a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context and thus balancing efficiency with reliability. Evaluations on eight medical datasets, spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks in visual question answering, report generation, and dedicated hallucination benchmarks, show that Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by an average of 13\% and improves hallucination accuracy by 6\% relative to baseline medical LVLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Disentangling Progress in Medical Image Registration: Beyond Trend-Driven Architectures towards Domain-Specific Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01913v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image registration drives quantitative analysis across organs, modalities, and patient populations. Recent deep learning methods often combine low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks from computer vision, such as large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models, with high-level registration-specific designs like motion pyramids, correlation layers, and iterative refinement. Yet, their relative contributions remain unclear and entangled. This raises a central question: should future advances in registration focus on importing generic architectural trends or on refining domain-specific design principles? Through a modular framework spanning brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration, we systematically disentangle the influence of these two paradigms. Our evaluation reveals that low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks offer only marginal or inconsistent gains, while high-level registration-specific designs consistently deliver more accurate, smoother, and more robust deformations. These domain priors significantly elevate the performance of a standard U-Net baseline, far more than variants incorporating "trend-driven" blocks, achieving an average relative improvement of $\sim3\%$. All models and experiments are released within a transparent, modular benchmark that enables plug-and-play comparison for new architectures and registration tasks (https://github.com/BailiangJ/rethink-reg). This dynamic and extensible platform establishes a common ground for reproducible and fair evaluation, inviting the community to isolate genuine methodological contributions from domain priors. Our findings advocate a shift in research emphasis: from following architectural trends to embracing domain-specific design principles as the true drivers of progress in learning-based medical image registration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis.

| **[Global-to-local image quality assessment in optical microscopy via fast and robust deep learning predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04859v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal domain. To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrmμ$DeepIQA, is inspired by previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrmμ$DeepIQA provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers, the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures. μDeepIQA is publicly available at https://git.photonicdata.science/elena.corbetta/udeepiqa</p></details> | None |

However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address. Additionally, we provide a collection of essential open-access resources, tools, and tutorials, available on our GitHub: https://github.com/mkhateri/Awesome-MRI-Super-Resolution.

This technology can for example superimpose faces and voices onto videos, creating hyper-realistic but artificial representations. Deepfakes pose significant risks regarding misinformation and fake news, because they can spread false information by depicting public figures saying or doing things they never did, undermining public trust. In this paper, we propose a method that leverages BLS signatures (Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham 2004) to implement signatures that remain valid after image cropping, but are invalidated in all the other types of manipulation, including deepfake creation. Our approach does not require who crops the image to know the signature private key or to be trusted in general, and it is O(1) in terms of signature size, making it a practical solution for scenarios where images are disseminated through web servers and cropping is the primary transformation. Finally, we adapted the signature scheme for the JPEG standard, and we experimentally tested the size of a signed image.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adversarial Confusion Attack: Disrupting Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20494v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Adversarial Confusion Attack, a new class of threats against multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, the goal is to induce systematic disruption that makes the model generate incoherent or confidently incorrect outputs. Practical applications include embedding such adversarial images into websites to prevent MLLM-powered AI Agents from operating reliably. The proposed attack maximizes next-token entropy using a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs. In the white-box setting, we show that a single adversarial image can disrupt all models in the ensemble, both in the full-image and Adversarial CAPTCHA settings. Despite relying on a basic adversarial technique (PGD), the attack generates perturbations that transfer to both unseen open-source (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-5.1) models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Harnessing Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Images for Fair Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08711v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI AISI Track, 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Benchmarking pig detection and tracking under diverse and challenging conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16639v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space (object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models. However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use and further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures and 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Envision: Benchmarking Unified Understanding & Generation for Causal World Process Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01816v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal models aim to transcend the limitations of single-modality representations by unifying understanding and generation, often using text-to-image (T2I) tasks to calibrate semantic consistency. However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 12 figures, 10 tables</p></details> | None |

While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures and 7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[IGen: Scalable Data Generation for Robot Learning from Open-World Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01773v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of generalist robotic policies has created an exponential demand for large-scale training data. However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data. This highlights the potential of IGen to support scalable data generation from open-world images for generalist robotic policy training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures | None |

The study of generating high-quality SVG has continuously drawn attention from both designers and researchers in the AIGC community. However, existing methods either produces unstructured outputs with huge computational cost or is limited to generating monochrome icons of over-simplified structures. To produce high-quality and complex SVG, we propose OmniSVG, a unified framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for end-to-end multimodal SVG generation. By parameterizing SVG commands and coordinates into discrete tokens, OmniSVG decouples structural logic from low-level geometry for efficient training while maintaining the expressiveness of complex SVG structure. To further advance the development of SVG synthesis, we introduce MMSVG-2M, a multimodal dataset with two million richly annotated SVG assets, along with a standardized evaluation protocol for conditional SVG generation tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG outperforms existing methods and demonstrates its potential for integration into professional SVG design workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages; Project Page: https://omnisvg.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain. This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a report submitted as part of PhD proposal defense of Hafsa Billah</p></details> | None |

However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability. Our method is lightweight, scalable, and readily integrates with diffusion pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

In our method, users are able to put three inputs into the system, including a semantic concept, a word, and a letter. The semantic concept will be used to change the shape of the input letter and generate the texture based on the pre-defined prompt using stable diffusion models. Our pipeline maps the texture on a text image in a way that preserves the readability of the whole output while preserving legibility. The system also provides real-time adjustments for the user to change the scale of the texture and apply it to the text image. User evaluations demonstrate that our method effectively represents semantic meaning without compromising legibility, making it a robust and innovative tool for graphic design, logo creation, and artistic typography.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Do Vision-Language Models Leak What They Learn? Adaptive Token-Weighted Model Inversion Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04097v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing private training data from trained neural networks. While prior studies have primarily examined unimodal deep networks, the vulnerability of vision-language models (VLMs) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MI attacks on VLMs to understand their susceptibility to leaking private visual training data. Our work makes two main contributions. First, tailored to the token-generative nature of VLMs, we introduce a suite of token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies, providing a comprehensive analysis of VLMs' vulnerability under different attack formulations. Second, based on the observation that tokens vary in their visual grounding, and hence their gradients differ in informativeness for image reconstruction, we propose Sequence-based Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW) as a novel MI for VLMs. SMI-AW dynamically reweights each token's loss gradient according to its visual grounding, enabling the optimization to focus on visually informative tokens and more effectively guide the reconstruction of private images. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations on a range of state-of-the-art VLMs across multiple datasets, we show that VLMs are susceptible to training data leakage. Human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack accuracy of 61.21%, underscoring the severity of these privacy risks. Notably, we demonstrate that publicly released VLMs are vulnerable to such attacks. Our study highlights the urgent need for privacy safeguards as VLMs become increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance.

TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers. We hope this study and the ViT$^3$ baseline can facilitate future work on visual TTT models.

While supervised CIR methods achieve high accuracy, their reliance on costly triplet annotations motivates zero-shot solutions. The core challenge in zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) stems from a fundamental dilemma: existing text-centric or diffusion-based approaches struggle to effectively bridge the vision-language modality gap. To address this, we propose Fusion-Diff, a novel generative editing framework with high effectiveness and data efficiency designed for multimodal alignment. First, it introduces a multimodal fusion feature editing strategy within a joint vision-language (VL) space, substantially narrowing the modality gap. Second, to maximize data efficiency, the framework incorporates a lightweight Control-Adapter, enabling state-of-the-art performance through fine-tuning on only a limited-scale synthetic dataset of 200K samples. Extensive experiments on standard CIR benchmarks (CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO) demonstrate that Fusion-Diff significantly outperforms prior zero-shot approaches. We further enhance the interpretability of our model by visualizing the fused multimodal representations.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce SPARK, a framework for reconstructing physically consistent, kinematic part-level articulated objects from a single RGB image. Given an input image, we first leverage VLMs to extract coarse URDF parameters and generate part-level reference images. We then integrate the part-image guidance and the inferred structure graph into a generative diffusion transformer to synthesize consistent part and complete shapes of articulated objects. To further refine the URDF parameters, we incorporate differentiable forward kinematics and differentiable rendering to optimize joint types, axes, and origins under VLM-generated open-state supervision. Extensive experiments show that SPARK produces high-quality, simulation-ready articulated assets across diverse categories, enabling downstream applications such as robotic manipulation and interaction modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

While these models excel at temporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by the continuous nature of their training data. We hypothesize that by injecting the rich and unconstrained content diversity from image data into this coherent temporal framework, we can generate image sets that feature both natural transitions and a far more expansive dynamic range. To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

In this study, we propose a deep learning-based multimodal framework integrating CT imaging, radiomics, and clinical data to predict metastasis risk in HNSCC. A total of 1497 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Tumor and organ masks were generated from pretreatment CT scans, from which a 3D Swin Transformer extracted deep imaging features, while 1562 radiomics features were reduced to 36 via correlation filtering and random forest selection. Clinical data (age, sex, smoking, and alcohol status) were encoded and fused with imaging features, and the multimodal representation was fed into a fully connected network for prediction. Five-fold cross-validation was used to assess performance via AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The multimodal model outperformed all single-modality baselines. The deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of 0.715, whereas multimodal fusion significantly improved performance (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758). Stratified analyses confirmed good generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation experiments demonstrated complementary contributions from each modality, and the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representations than conventional architectures. This multimodal deep learning model enables accurate, non-invasive metastasis prediction in HNSCC and shows strong potential for individualized treatment planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables.

| **[Resource-Efficient Beam Prediction in mmWave Communications with Multimodal Realistic Simulation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05187v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beamforming is a key technology in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications that improves signal transmission by optimizing directionality and intensity. However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a novel resource-efficient learning framework is introduced for beam prediction, which leverages a custom-designed cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD) algorithm specifically tailored for beam prediction tasks, to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a radar-only student model, achieving high accuracy with reduced computational cost. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing on Dec. 01, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Robust Detection of Synthetic Tabular Data under Schema Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00092v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time. We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data ''in the wild'', i.e. when the detector is deployed on tables with variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7 points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in real-world conditions is feasible, and demonstrates substantial improvements over previous approaches. Following acceptance of the paper, we are finalizing the administrative and licensing procedures necessary for releasing the source code. This extended version will be updated as soon as the release is complete.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised One-Step Diffusion Refinement for Snapshot Compressive Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07417v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures multispectral images (MSIs) using a single coded two-dimensional (2-D) measurement, but reconstructing high-fidelity MSIs from these compressed inputs remains a fundamentally ill-posed challenge. While diffusion-based reconstruction methods have recently raised the bar for quality, they face critical limitations: a lack of large-scale MSI training data, adverse domain shifts from RGB-pretrained models, and inference inefficiencies due to multi-step sampling. These drawbacks restrict their practicality in real-world applications. In contrast to existing methods, which either follow costly iterative refinement or adapt subspace-based embeddings for diffusion models (e.g. DiffSCI, PSR-SCI), we introduce a fundamentally different paradigm: a self-supervised One-Step Diffusion (OSD) framework specifically designed for SCI. The key novelty lies in using a single-step diffusion refiner to correct an initial reconstruction, eliminating iterative denoising entirely while preserving generative quality. Moreover, we adopt a self-supervised equivariant learning strategy to train both the predictor and refiner directly from raw 2-D measurements, enabling generalization to unseen domains without the need for ground-truth MSI. To further address the challenge of limited MSI data, we design a band-selection-driven distillation strategy that transfers core generative priors from large-scale RGB datasets, effectively bridging the domain gap. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach sets a new benchmark, yielding PSNR gains of 3.44 dB, 1.61 dB, and 0.28 dB on the Harvard, NTIRE, and ICVL datasets, respectively, while reducing reconstruction time by 97.5%. This remarkable improvement in efficiency and adaptability makes our method a significant advancement in SCI reconstruction, combining both accuracy and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FlashVGGT: Efficient and Scalable Visual Geometry Transformers with Compressed Descriptor Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01540v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in computer vision. Recently, feed-forward methods have emerged as efficient and robust alternatives to traditional per-scene optimization techniques. Among them, state-of-the-art models like the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer (VGGT) leverage full self-attention over all image tokens to capture global relationships. However, this approach suffers from poor scalability due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the large number of tokens generated in long image sequences. In this work, we introduce FlashVGGT, an efficient alternative that addresses this bottleneck through a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Instead of applying dense global attention across all tokens, FlashVGGT compresses spatial information from each frame into a compact set of descriptor tokens. Global attention is then computed as cross-attention between the full set of image tokens and this smaller descriptor set, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, the compactness of the descriptors enables online inference over long sequences via a chunk-recursive mechanism that reuses cached descriptors from previous chunks. Experimental results show that FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scaling efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

Despite recent advances in multimodal techniques that leverage complementary RGB images to compensate for missing geometry, most methods still follow a Completion-by-Inpainting paradigm, synthesizing missing structures from fused latent features. We empirically show that this paradigm often results in structural inconsistencies and topological artifacts due to limited geometric and semantic constraints. To address this, we rethink the task and propose a more robust paradigm, termed Completion-by-Correction, which begins with a topologically complete shape prior generated by a pretrained image-to-3D model and performs feature-space correction to align it with the partial observation. This paradigm shifts completion from unconstrained synthesis to guided refinement, enabling structurally consistent and observation-aligned reconstruction. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce PGNet, a multi-stage framework that conducts dual-feature encoding to ground the generative prior, synthesizes a coarse yet structurally aligned scaffold, and progressively refines geometric details via hierarchical correction. Experiments on the ShapeNetViPC dataset demonstrate the superiority of PGNet over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of average Chamfer Distance (-23.5%) and F-score (+7.1%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Diffusion Fuzzy System: Fuzzy Rule Guided Latent Multi-Path Diffusion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01533v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a leading technique for generating images due to their ability to create high-resolution and realistic images. Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[QuantumCanvas: A Multimodal Benchmark for Visual Learning of Atomic Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01519v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

Traditional methods for determining the permeability tensor involving flow simulations or experiments can be time consuming and resource-intensive, while analytical methods, e.g., based on the Kozeny-Carman equation, may be too simplistic for accurate prediction based on pore-scale features. In this work, we explore deep learning as a more efficient alternative for predicting the permeability tensor based on two-dimensional binary images of porous media, segmented into solid ($1$) and void ($0$) regions. We generate a dataset of 24,000 synthetic random periodic porous media samples with specified porosity and characteristic length scale. Using Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we compute the permeability tensor for flow through these samples with values spanning three orders of magnitude. We evaluate three families of image-based deep learning models: ResNet (ResNet-$50$ and ResNet-$101$), Vision Transformers (ViT-T$16$ and ViT-S$16$) and ConvNeXt (Tiny and Small). To improve model generalisation, we employ techniques such as weight decay, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation. The effect of data augmentation and dataset size on model performance is studied, and we find that they generally increase the accuracy of permeability predictions. We also show that ConvNeXt and ResNet converge faster than ViT and degrade in performance if trained for too long. ConvNeXt-Small achieved the highest $R^2$ score of $0.99460$ on $4,000$ unseen test samples. These findings underscore the potential to use image-based neural networks to predict permeability tensors accurately.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting. Overall, our evaluation shows that SRCSM can be considered a new state-of-the-art in DG for medical image segmentation and, moreover, even achieves a segmentation performance that matches the performance of the in-domain baseline in several settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine (currently under revision)</p></details> | None |

Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume.

Beyond image signals, systematic data loss, noise pollution, and audio file corruption can occur due to the unpredictability of the MRI acquisition environment. In such cases, generating audio from images is critical for data recovery in both clinical and research applications. However, this remains challenging due to hardware constraints, acoustic interference, and data corruption. Existing solutions, such as denoising and multi-stage synthesis methods, face limitations in audio fidelity and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge Enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (KE-CVAE), a novel two-step "knowledge enhancement + variational inference" framework for generating speech audio signals from cine dynamic MRI sequences. This approach introduces two key innovations: (1) integration of unlabeled MRI data for knowledge enhancement, and (2) a variational inference architecture to improve generative modeling capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts at synthesizing speech audio directly from dynamic MRI video sequences. The proposed method was trained and evaluated on an open-source dynamic vocal tract MRI dataset recorded during speech. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating natural speech waveforms while addressing MRI-specific acoustic challenges, outperforming conventional deep learning-based synthesis approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent voxel-based approaches can generate both geometric structures and semantic labels, existing range-view methods are limited to producing unlabeled LiDAR scenes. Relying on pretrained segmentation models to predict the semantic maps often results in suboptimal cross-modal consistency. To address this limitation while preserving the advantages of range-view representations, such as computational efficiency and simplified network design, we propose Spiral, a novel range-view LiDAR diffusion model that simultaneously generates depth, reflectance images, and semantic maps. Furthermore, we introduce novel semantic-aware metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated labeled range-view data. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that Spiral achieves state-of-the-art performance with the smallest parameter size, outperforming two-step methods that combine the generative and segmentation models. Additionally, we validate that range images generated by Spiral can be effectively used for synthetic data augmentation in the downstream segmentation training, significantly reducing the labeling effort on LiDAR data.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 24 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables; Code at https://github.com/worldbench/SPIRAL</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/worldbench/SPIRAL) |
| **[Language-Guided Open-World Anomaly Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01427v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-world and anomaly segmentation methods seek to enable autonomous driving systems to detect and segment both known and unknown objects in real-world scenes. However, existing methods do not assign semantically meaningful labels to unknown regions, and distinguishing and learning representations for unknown classes remains difficult. While open-vocabulary segmentation methods show promise in generalizing to novel classes, they require a fixed inference vocabulary and thus cannot be directly applied to anomaly segmentation where unknown classes are unconstrained. We propose Clipomaly, the first CLIP-based open-world and anomaly segmentation method for autonomous driving. Our zero-shot approach requires no anomaly-specific training data and leverages CLIP's shared image-text embedding space to both segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names to them. Unlike open-vocabulary methods, our model dynamically extends its vocabulary at inference time without retraining, enabling robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions such as those in Cityscapes. Clipomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on established anomaly segmentation benchmarks while providing interpretability and flexibility essential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior work mitigates these issues with complex pipelines that first perform a base-resolution (i.e., training-resolution) denoising process to guide HR generation. We instead explore the intrinsic generative mechanisms of DiTs and propose ResDiT, a training-free method that scales resolution efficiently. We identify the core factor governing spatial layout, position embeddings (PEs), and show that the original PEs encode incorrect positional information when extrapolated to HR, which triggers layout collapse. To address this, we introduce a PE scaling technique that rectifies positional encoding under resolution changes. To further remedy low-fidelity details, we develop a local-enhancement mechanism grounded in base-resolution local attention. We design a patch-level fusion module that aggregates global and local cues, together with a Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy that eliminates grid artifacts. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks, including spatially controlled generation.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |
| **[Rethinking Efficient Mixture-of-Experts for Remote Sensing Modality-Missing Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11460v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Fine-grained Image Retrieval via Dual-Vision Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16273v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model. However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training. Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 | None |

Existing metrics, such as Chamfer Distance, often fail to align with how humans evaluate the fidelity of 3D shapes. Recent learning-based metrics attempt to improve this by relying on rendered images and 2D image quality metrics. However, these approaches face limitations due to incomplete structural coverage and sensitivity to viewpoint choices. Moreover, most methods are trained on synthetic distortions, which differ significantly from real-world distortions, resulting in a domain gap. To address these challenges, we propose a new fidelity evaluation method that is based directly on 3D meshes with texture, without relying on rendering. Our method, named Textured Geometry Evaluation TGE, jointly uses the geometry and color information to calculate the fidelity of the input textured mesh with comparison to a reference colored shape. To train and evaluate our metric, we design a human-annotated dataset with real-world distortions. Experiments show that TGE outperforms rendering-based and geometry-only methods on real-world distortion dataset.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI26 | None |

However, most existing approaches uniformly annotate 3D bounding boxes, ignore objects' physical states, and require multiple self-training iterations for annotation refinement, resulting in suboptimal quality and substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose OpenBox, a two-stage automatic annotation pipeline that leverages a 2D vision foundation model. In the first stage, OpenBox associates instance-level cues from 2D images processed by a vision foundation model with the corresponding 3D point clouds via cross-modal instance alignment. In the second stage, it categorizes instances by rigidity and motion state, then generates adaptive bounding boxes with class-specific size statistics. As a result, OpenBox produces high-quality 3D bounding box annotations without requiring self-training. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, the Lyft Level 5 Perception dataset, and the nuScenes dataset demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency over baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

These languages, often lacking comprehensive linguistic resources, require special attention to develop robust systems for accurate optical character recognition (OCR). This paper introduces BharatOCR, a novel segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten Hindi and Urdu text recognition. We propose a ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture for handwritten text recognition, where a Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts visual features, a Transformer decoder generates text sequences, and a pre-trained language model (LM) refines the output to improve accuracy, fluency, and coherence. Our model utilizes a Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model proposed for masked image modeling in this research work. In addition, we adopt a RoBERTa architecture optimized for masked language modeling (MLM) to enhance the linguistic comprehension and generative capabilities of the proposed model. The transformer decoder generates text sequences from visual embeddings. This model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line, called implicit line segmentation. The proposed model was evaluated using our custom dataset ('Parimal Urdu') and ('Parimal Hindi'), introduced in this research work, as well as two public datasets. The proposed model achieved benchmark results in the NUST-UHWR, PUCIT-OUHL, and Parimal-Urdu datasets, achieving character recognition rates of 96.24%, 92.05%, and 94.80%, respectively. The model also provided benchmark results using the Hindi dataset achieving a character recognition rate of 80.64%. The results obtained from our proposed model indicated that it outperformed several state-of-the-art Urdu text recognition methods.</p></details> | 21 Pages | None |
| **[InternVideo-Next: Towards General Video Foundation Models without Video-Text Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01342v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods still struggle to adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics, especially when prompts entail substantial transformations of the input image (e.g., object addition, deletion, or modification), a shortcoming we term semantic negligence. In a pilot study, we find that applying a Gaussian blur to the input image improves semantic adherence. Analyzing attention maps, we observe clearer foreground-background separation. From an energy perspective, this corresponds to a lower-entropy cross-attention distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce AlignVid, a training-free framework with two components: (i) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM), which directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and (ii) Guidance Scheduling (GS), which applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. This minimal intervention improves prompt adherence while limiting aesthetic degradation. In addition, we introduce OmitI2V to evaluate semantic negligence in TI2V generation, comprising 367 human-annotated samples that span addition, deletion, and modification scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignVid can enhance semantic fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the severity of these risks, there is a notable lack of dedicated datasets for the complex, enclosed environments found inside fuel tanks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel dataset, FOD-S2R, composed of real and synthetic images of the FOD within a simulated aircraft fuel tank. Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures. The real-world subset consists of 3,114 high-resolution HD images captured in a controlled fuel tank replica, while the synthetic subset includes 3,137 images generated using Unreal Engine. The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size. Prior research has demonstrated that synthetic data can reduce reliance on extensive real-world annotations and improve the generalizability of vision models. Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the model performance and narrowing the Sim2Real gap, providing a valuable foundation for developing automated FOD detection systems for aviation maintenance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures | None |

Designing robust watermarks capable of withstanding various attacks and processing operations is even more paramount. We introduce TokenPure, a novel Diffusion Transformer-based framework designed for effective and consistent watermark removal. TokenPure solves the trade-off between thorough watermark destruction and content consistency by leveraging token-based conditional reconstruction. It reframes the task as conditional generation, entirely bypassing the initial watermark-carrying noise. We achieve this by decomposing the watermarked image into two complementary token sets: visual tokens for texture and structural tokens for geometry. These tokens jointly condition the diffusion process, enabling the framework to synthesize watermark-free images with fine-grained consistency and structural integrity. Comprehensive experiments show that TokenPure achieves state-of-the-art watermark removal and reconstruction fidelity, substantially outperforming existing baselines in both perceptual quality and consistency.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose DCText, a training-free visual text generation method that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, leveraging the reliable short-text generation of Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers. Our method first decomposes a prompt by extracting and dividing the target text, then assigns each to a designated region. To accurately render each segment within their regions while preserving overall image coherence, we introduce two attention masks - Text-Focus and Context-Expansion - applied sequentially during denoising. Additionally, Localized Noise Initialization further improves text accuracy and region alignment without increasing computational cost. Extensive experiments on single- and multisentence benchmarks show that DCText achieves the best text accuracy without compromising image quality while also delivering the lowest generation latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the availability of real and synthetic datasets, existing AI models that achieve high accuracy often over-rely on seafloor features, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates two key modules: (i) a Targeted Contrastive Unlearning (TCU) module, which extends the traditional triplet loss to reduce seafloor-induced background bias and improve generalization, and (ii) the Unlearn to Explain Sonar Framework (UESF), which provides visual insights into what the model has deliberately forgotten while adapting the LIME explainer to generate more faithful and localized attributions for unlearning evaluation. Extensive experiments across both real and synthetic sonar datasets validate our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in unlearning effectiveness, model robustness, and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVIP 2025</p></details> | None |

Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has significant progress in automated retinal analysis, supporting tasks such as fundus image classification, lesion detection, and vessel segmentation. As a representative lightweight network, nnMobileNet has demonstrated strong performance across multiple retinal benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient. However, purely convolutional architectures inherently struggle to capture long-range dependencies and model the irregular lesions and elongated vascular patterns that characterize on retinal images, despite the critical importance of vascular features for reliable clinical diagnosis. To further advance this line of work and extend the original vision of nnMobileNet, we propose nnMobileNet++, a hybrid architecture that progressively bridges convolutional and transformer representations. The framework integrates three key components: (i) dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, (ii) stage-specific transformer blocks introduced after the second down-sampling stage for global context modeling, and (iii) retinal image pretraining to improve generalization. Experiments on multiple public retinal datasets for classification, together with ablation studies, demonstrate that nnMobileNet++ achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive accuracy while maintaining low computational cost, underscoring its potential as a lightweight yet effective framework for retinal image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

As a core component of document parsing, TR has long relied on supervised learning, with recent efforts dominated by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) using labeled data. While VLMs have brought TR to the next level, pushing performance further demands large-scale labeled data that is costly to obtain. Consequently, although proprietary models have continuously pushed the performance boundary, open-source models, often trained with limited resources and, in practice, the only viable option for many due to privacy regulations, still lag far behind. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRivia, a self-supervised fine-tuning method that enables pretrained VLMs to learn TR directly from unlabeled table images in the wild. Built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization, TRivia automatically identifies unlabeled samples that most effectively facilitate learning and eliminates the need for human annotations through a question-answering-based reward mechanism. An attention-guided module generates diverse questions for each table image, and the ability to interpret the recognition results and answer them correctly provides feedback to optimize the TR model. This closed-loop process allows the TR model to autonomously learn to recognize, structure, and reason over tables without labeled data. Leveraging this pipeline, we present TRivia-3B, an open-sourced, compact, and state-of-the-art TR model that surpasses existing systems (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks.

To extract information more efficiently for text recognition, document image enhancement and binarization are often employed as preliminary steps in document analysis. Training independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for each color channel can generate images where shadows and noise are effectively removed, which subsequently allows for efficient text information extraction. However, employing multiple GANs for different color channels requires long training and inference times. To reduce both the training and inference times of these preliminary steps, we propose an efficient method based on multi-scale feature extraction, which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation and normalization to process document images before submitting them to GANs for training. Experiment results show that our proposed method significantly reduces both the training and inference times while maintaining comparable performances when benchmarked against the state-of-the-art methods. In the best case scenario, a reduction of 10% and 26% are observed for training and inference times, respectively, while maintaining the model performance at 73.79 of Average-Score metric.

To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation.

However, when extended to multiple subjects, existing models often exhibit degraded performance, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and adhering to textual prompts. We attribute these limitations to the absence of high-quality multi-subject datasets and refined post-training strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable multi-subject data generation pipeline that leverages powerful single-subject generation models to construct diverse and high-quality multi-subject training data. Through this dataset, we first enable single-subject personalization models to acquire knowledge of synthesizing multi-image and multi-subject scenarios. Furthermore, to enhance both subject consistency and text controllability, we design a set of Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards, which are incorporated into a refined reinforcement learning stage. To comprehensively evaluate multi-subject personalization, we introduce a new benchmark that assesses model performance using seven subsets across three dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in advancing multi-subject personalized image generation.

However, current text- or image-driven 3D scene generation methods mainly focus on large-scale scenes, struggling to capture the high-density layouts and complex spatial relations that characterize tabletop scenes. To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene. A key component of our framework is a novel pose and scale alignment approach that decouples the complex spatial reasoning into two stages: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for precise rotation recovery and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for robust translation and scale estimation, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D reference. Extensive experiments and user studies show that TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, markedly surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, capable of generating realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity.

However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals.

While previous studies typically concentrated on brain-to-image and brain-to-language reconstruction, our work strives to reconstruct gestures associated with speech stimuli perceived by brain. Unfortunately, the lack of paired \{brain, speech, gesture\} data hinders the deployment of deep learning models for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, \textbf{fMRI2GES}, that allows training of fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction networks on unpaired data using \textbf{Dual Brain Decoding Alignment}. This method relies on two key components: (i) observed texts that elicit brain responses, and (ii) textual descriptions associated with the gestures. Then, instead of training models in a completely supervised manner to find a mapping relationship among the three modalities, we harness an fMRI-to-text model, a text-to-gesture model with paired data and an fMRI-to-gesture model with unpaired data, establishing dual fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction patterns. Afterward, we explicitly align two outputs and train our model in a self-supervision way. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct expressive gestures directly from fMRI recordings.

We propose a more convenient solution that enables full-body video capture using handheld mobile devices. Our approach takes as input two static photos (front and back) of you in a mirror, along with an IMU motion reference that you perform while holding your mobile phone, and synthesizes a realistic video of you performing a similar target motion. We enable rendering into a new scene, with consistent illumination and shadows. We propose a novel video diffusion-based model to achieve this. Specifically, we propose a parameter-free frame generation strategy and a multi-reference attention mechanism to effectively integrate appearance information from both the front and back selfies into the video diffusion model. Further, we introduce an image-based fine-tuning strategy to enhance frame sharpness and improve shadows and reflections generation for more realistic human-scene composition.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial editing in diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some errors in the critical data presented in Table 1 and Table 2</p></details> | None |

However, they routinely fail to capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is challenged by arduous pipelines to transform raw experimental data into atomic models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling trajectory of a pretrained biomolecular structure prediction model using both global and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods largely operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the parameters of the pre-trained model, which can lead to models that are overly specialized to the observed downstream data. Recent studies suggest that one mechanism underlying such forgetting is the introduction of intruder dimensions into the representation space during fine-tuning. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and to enhance robustness, we propose Vector-based Feature Adaptation (VeFA), a new fine-tuning method that operates directly in the feature space, which naturally avoids generating intruder dimensions. VeFA performs element-wise adaptation on individual features, thereby ensuring that the effective fine-tuned weights always remain within the column space of the pre-trained weight matrix. This feature-space adaptation perspective is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of downstream lurking variables that induce distribution shifts, which posits that the influence of unobserved factors can be represented as an equivalent aggregate effect on observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, VeFA preserves the pre-trained representations and improves model generalization under distribution shift. We evaluate VeFA against LoRA on image classification, NLU, and NLG benchmarks, considering both standard fine-tuning performance and robustness; across these tasks, VeFA achieves comparable fine-tuning performance while consistently exhibiting stronger robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

This is motivated by the "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis", which suggests the existence of smaller sub-networks within larger pre-trained networks that perform comparatively well (if not better). Whilst most literature in this area focuses on Deep Neural Networks more generally, we specifically consider Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification tasks. Building on the hypothesis, we compare simple magnitude-based pruning, a Frank-Wolfe style pruning scheme, and an FW method with momentum on a CNN trained on MNIST. Our experiments track test accuracy, loss, sparsity, and inference time as we vary the dense pre-training budget from 1 to 10 epochs. We find that FW with momentum yields pruned networks that are both sparser and more accurate than the original dense model and the simple pruning baselines, while incurring minimal inference-time overhead in our implementation. Moreover, FW with momentum reaches these accuracies after only a few epochs of pre-training, indicating that full pre-training of the dense model is not required in this setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary preprint; numerical experiments are still being validated and may be updated in future revisions</p></details> | None |

PET plays a vital role in oncology, but automating report generation is difficult due to the complexity of whole-body 3D volumes, the wide range of potential clinical findings, and the limited availability of annotated datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce PETARSeg-11K, the first large-scale, publicly available dataset that provides lesion-level correspondence between 3D PET/CT volumes and free-text radiological findings. It comprises 11,356 lesion descriptions paired with 3D segmentations. Second, we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D vision-language model designed for mask-aware, spatially grounded PET/CT reporting. PETAR-4B jointly encodes PET, CT, and 3D lesion segmentation masks, using a 3D focal prompt to capture fine-grained details of lesions that normally comprise less than 0.1% of the volume. Evaluations using automated metrics show PETAR-4B substantially outperforming all 2D and 3D baselines. A human study involving five physicians -- the first of its kind for automated PET reporting -- confirms the model's clinical utility and establishes correlations between automated metrics and expert judgment. This work provides a foundational dataset and a novel architecture, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding in PET.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OmniFD: A Unified Model for Versatile Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01128v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face forgery detection encompasses multiple critical tasks, including identifying forged images and videos and localizing manipulated regions and temporal segments. Current approaches typically employ task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. We introduce OmniFD, a unified framework that jointly addresses four core face forgery detection tasks within a single model, i.e., image and video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization. Our architecture consists of three principal components: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder that extracts unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from both images and video inputs, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that dynamically captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads that transform refined representations into corresponding predictions for all FFD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate OmniFD's advantage over task-specific models. Its unified design leverages multi-task learning to capture generalized representations across tasks, especially enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer that facilitates other tasks. For example, video classification accuracy improves by 4.63% when image data are incorporated. Furthermore, by unifying images, videos and the four tasks within one framework, OmniFD achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks with high efficiency and scalability, e.g., reducing 63% model parameters and 50% training time. It establishes a practical and generalizable solution for comprehensive face forgery detection in real-world applications.

However, they need many sampling steps to create high-quality generations, resulting in slow inference speed. In this work, we propose Speed-RL, a novel paradigm for accelerating a pretrained MGMs to generate high-quality images in fewer steps. Unlike conventional distillation methods which formulate the acceleration problem as a distribution matching problem, where a few-step student model is trained to match the distribution generated by a many-step teacher model, we consider this problem as a reinforcement learning problem. Since the goal of acceleration is to generate high quality images in fewer steps, we can combine a quality reward with a speed reward and finetune the base model using reinforcement learning with the combined reward as the optimization target. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method was able to accelerate the base model by a factor of 3x while maintaining comparable image quality.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Generalized Medical Phrase Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01085v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical phrase grounding (MPG) maps textual descriptions of radiological findings to corresponding image regions. These grounded reports are easier to interpret, especially for non-experts. Existing MPG systems mostly follow the referring expression comprehension (REC) paradigm and return exactly one bounding box per phrase. Real reports often violate this assumption. They contain multi-region findings, non-diagnostic text, and non-groundable phrases, such as negations or descriptions of normal anatomy. Motivated by this, we reformulate the task as generalised medical phrase grounding (GMPG), where each sentence is mapped to zero, one, or multiple scored regions. To realise this formulation, we introduce the first GMPG model: MedGrounder. We adopted a two-stage training regime: pre-training on report sentence--anatomy box alignment datasets and fine-tuning on report sentence--human annotated box datasets. Experiments on PadChest-GR and MS-CXR show that MedGrounder achieves strong zero-shot transfer and outperforms REC-style and grounded report generation baselines on multi-region and non-groundable phrases, while using far fewer human box annotations. Finally, we show that MedGrounder can be composed with existing report generators to produce grounded reports without retraining the generator.</p></details> |  | None |

Several attempts have been made to protect individuals from being identified by unauthorized FR systems utilizing adversarial attacks to generate encrypted face images. However, existing methods suffer from poor visual quality or low attack success rates, which limit their utility. Recently, diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in image generation. In this work, we ask: can diffusion models be used to generate adversarial examples to improve both visual quality and attack performance? We propose DiffProtect, which utilizes a diffusion autoencoder to generate semantically meaningful perturbations on FR systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffProtect produces more natural-looking encrypted images than state-of-the-art methods while achieving significantly higher attack success rates, e.g., 24.5% and 25.1% absolute improvements on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/joellliu/DiffProtect/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/joellliu/DiffProtect) |

To overcome this challenge, we propose precipitation nowcasting using satellite imagery with physics constraints for improved accuracy and physical consistency. We use a novel physics-informed dual neural operator (PIANO) structure to enforce the fundamental equation of advection-diffusion during training to predict satellite imagery using a PINN loss. Then, we use a generative model to convert satellite images to radar images, which are used for precipitation nowcasting. Compared to baseline models, our proposed model shows a notable improvement in moderate (4mm/h) precipitation event prediction alongside short-term heavy (8mm/h) precipitation event prediction. It also demonstrates low seasonal variability in predictions, indicating robustness for generalization. This study suggests the potential of the PIANO and serves as a good baseline for physics-informed precipitation nowcasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and Physical Sciences Workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[Lotus-2: Advancing Geometric Dense Prediction with Powerful Image Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01030v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering pixel-wise geometric properties from a single image is fundamentally ill-posed due to appearance ambiguity and non-injective mappings between 2D observations and 3D structures. While discriminative regression models achieve strong performance through large-scale supervision, their success is bounded by the scale, quality and diversity of available data and limited physical reasoning. Recent diffusion models exhibit powerful world priors that encode geometry and semantics learned from massive image-text data, yet directly reusing their stochastic generative formulation is suboptimal for deterministic geometric inference: the former is optimized for diverse and high-fidelity image generation, whereas the latter requires stable and accurate predictions. In this work, we propose Lotus-2, a two-stage deterministic framework for stable, accurate and fine-grained geometric dense prediction, aiming to provide an optimal adaption protocol to fully exploit the pre-trained generative priors. Specifically, in the first stage, the core predictor employs a single-step deterministic formulation with a clean-data objective and a lightweight local continuity module (LCM) to generate globally coherent structures without grid artifacts. In the second stage, the detail sharpener performs a constrained multi-step rectified-flow refinement within the manifold defined by the core predictor, enhancing fine-grained geometry through noise-free deterministic flow matching. Using only 59K training samples, less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, Lotus-2 establishes new state-of-the-art results in monocular depth estimation and highly competitive surface normal prediction. These results demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as deterministic world priors, enabling high-quality geometric reasoning beyond traditional discriminative and generative paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou).

We present LISA-3D, a two-stage framework that lifts language-image segmentation into 3D by retrofitting the instruction-following model LISA with geometry-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers and reusing a frozen SAM-3D reconstructor. During training we exploit off-the-shelf RGB-D sequences and their camera poses to build a differentiable reprojection loss that enforces cross-view agreement without requiring any additional 3D-text supervision. The resulting masks are concatenated with RGB images to form RGBA prompts for SAM-3D, which outputs Gaussian splats or textured meshes without retraining. Across ScanRefer and Nr3D, LISA-3D improves language-to-3D accuracy by up to +15.6 points over single-view baselines while adapting only 11.6M parameters. The system is modular, data-efficient, and supports zero-shot deployment on unseen categories, providing a practical recipe for language-guided 3D content creation.

Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $Δ< 0.07$), outperforming prior methods.

To provide composition guidance, we introduce PhotoFramer, a multi-modal composition instruction framework. Given a poorly composed image, PhotoFramer first describes how to improve the composition in natural language and then generates a well-composed example image. To train such a model, we curate a large-scale dataset. Inspired by how humans take photos, we organize composition guidance into a hierarchy of sub-tasks: shift, zoom-in, and view-change tasks. Shift and zoom-in data are sampled from existing cropping datasets, while view-change data are obtained via a two-stage pipeline. First, we sample pairs with varying viewpoints from multi-view datasets, and train a degradation model to transform well-composed photos into poorly composed ones. Second, we apply this degradation model to expert-taken photos to synthesize poor images to form training pairs. Using this dataset, we finetune a model that jointly processes and generates both text and images, enabling actionable textual guidance with illustrative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that textual instructions effectively steer image composition, and coupling them with exemplars yields consistent improvements over exemplar-only baselines. PhotoFramer offers a practical step toward composition assistants that make expert photographic priors accessible to everyday users.

To tackle this, we present MM-ACT, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates text, image, and action in shared token space and performs generation across all three modalities. MM-ACT adopts a re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs a one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency. We introduce Context-Shared Multimodal Learning, a unified training paradigm that supervises generation in all three modalities from a shared context, enhancing action generation through cross-modal learning. Experiments were conducted on the LIBERO simulation and Franka real-robot setups as well as RoboTwin2.0 to assess in-domain and out-of-domain performances respectively. Our approach achieves a success rate of 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% across three tasks of real Franka, and 52.38% across eight bimanual tasks of RoboTwin2.0 with an additional gain of 9.25% from cross-modal learning.

However, previous studies on 3D CT generation primarily focus on specific organs characterized by a local structure and fixed contrast and have yet to fully capitalize on the benefits of both semantic and textual conditions. In this paper, we present GuideGen, a controllable framework based on easily-acquired text prompts to generate anatomical masks and corresponding CT volumes for the entire torso-from chest to pelvis. Our approach includes three core components: a text-conditional semantic synthesizer for creating realistic full-torso anatomies; an anatomy-aware high-dynamic-range (HDR) autoencoder for high-fidelity feature extraction across varying intensity levels; and a latent feature generator that ensures alignment between CT images, anatomical semantics and input prompts. Combined, these components enable data synthesis for segmentation tasks from only textual instructions. To train and evaluate GuideGen, we compile a multi-modality cancer imaging dataset with paired CT and clinical descriptions from 12 public TCIA datasets and one private real-world dataset. Comprehensive evaluations across generation quality, cross-modality alignment, and data usability on multi-organ and tumor segmentation tasks demonstrate GuideGen's superiority over existing CT generation methods.

Success in this task demands effectively bridging the semantic gap between heterogeneous modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve superior cross-modal understanding by leveraging massive pretraining on image-text corpora, we observe that they often struggle with modality bias and fine-grained intra-modal feature extraction. This oversight leads to a lack of robustness in real-world scenarios where multimedia data is noisy, along with incomplete or misaligned modalities. To address this problem, we propose AimKP, a novel framework that explicitly reinforces intra-modal semantic learning in MLLMs while preserving cross-modal alignment. AimKP incorporates two core innovations: (i) Progressive Modality Masking, which forces fine-grained feature extraction from corrupted inputs by progressively masking modality information during training; (ii) Gradient-based Filtering, that identifies and discards noisy samples, preventing them from corrupting the model's core cross-modal learning. Extensive experiments validate AimKP's effectiveness in multimodal keyphrase generation and its robustness across different scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, non-upright panoramas due to unstable robot postures hinder downstream tasks. Traditional IMU-based correction methods suffer from drift and external disturbances, while vision-based approaches offer a promising alternative. This study presents a dual-stream angle-aware generation network that jointly estimates camera inclination angles and reconstructs upright panoramic images. The network comprises a CNN branch that extracts local geometric structures from equirectangular projections and a ViT branch that captures global contextual cues from cubemap projections. These are integrated through a dual-projection adaptive fusion module that aligns spatial features across both domains. To further enhance performance, we introduce a high-frequency enhancement block, circular padding, and channel attention mechanisms to preserve 360° continuity and improve geometric sensitivity. Experiments on the SUN360 and M3D datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both inclination estimation and upright panorama generation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each module and highlight the synergy between the two tasks.

Nevertheless, generating temporally coherent long-form content remains challenging. Existing approaches are constrained by computational and memory limitations, as they are typically trained on short video segments, thus performing effectively only over limited frame lengths and hindering their potential for extended coherent generation. To address these constraints, we propose TalkingPose, a novel diffusion-based framework specifically designed for producing long-form, temporally consistent human upper-body animations. TalkingPose leverages driving frames to precisely capture expressive facial and hand movements, transferring these seamlessly to a target actor through a stable diffusion backbone. To ensure continuous motion and enhance temporal coherence, we introduce a feedback-driven mechanism built upon image-based diffusion models. Notably, this mechanism does not incur additional computational costs or require secondary training stages, enabling the generation of animations with unlimited duration.

However, adapting these models to new datasets or domains is computationally costly, especially in low-resource or few-shot settings, and existing prompt-learning methods often lack interpretability. We introduce Efficient Prompt Learning with Knowledge Graph (EPLKG), which uses a knowledge graph to curate diverse, interpretable prompts and, where KG coverage is limited, augments this bank with LLM-generated human-readable visual descriptions. EPLKG operates entirely on cached CLIP image and text embeddings and employs a lightweight Gumbel-Softmax module to select a single prompt per image-class pair, enabling low-memory, fast training. Across 11 benchmarks, EPLKG reduces per-image training time by up to 45 percent and peak GPU memory by around 30 to 40 percent compared to strong prompt-learning baselines, while keeping the average base-new harmonic-mean accuracy within 2 percentage points, thereby improving the efficiency of model adaptation without sacrificing competitive performance or interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |

To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.</p></details> |  | None |

To cope with this problem, one mainstream approach is to treat the sampling process as an algorithm that solves an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Our study proposes a training-free inference plugin compatible with most few-step ODE solvers. To the best of my knowledge, our algorithm is the first training-free algorithm to sample a 1024 x 1024-resolution image in 6 steps and a 512 x 512-resolution image in 5 steps, with an FID result that outperforms the SOTA distillation models and the 20-step DPM++ 2m solver, respectively. Based on analyses of the latent diffusion model's structure, the diffusion ODE, and the Free-U mechanism, we explain why specific hyperparameter couplings improve stability and inference speed without retraining. Meanwhile, experimental results also reveal a new design space of the latent diffusion ODE solver. Additionally, we also analyze the difference between the original diffusion model and the diffusion distillation model via an information-theoretic study, which shows the reason why the few-step ODE solver designed for the diffusion model can outperform the training-based diffusion distillation algorithm in few-step inference. The tentative results of the experiment prove the mathematical analysis. code base is below: https://github.com/TheLovesOfLadyPurple/Hyperparameter-is-all-you-need</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/TheLovesOfLadyPurple/Hyperparameter-is-all-you-need) |

Existing methods often yield suboptimal performance in generating high-quality 3D medical images, and there is currently no universal generative framework for medical imaging. In this paper, we introduce a 3D Medical Latent Diffusion (3D MedDiffusion) model for controllable, high-quality 3D medical image generation. 3D MedDiffusion incorporates a novel, highly efficient Patch-Volume Autoencoder that compresses medical images into latent space through patch-wise encoding and recovers back into image space through volume-wise decoding. Additionally, we design a new noise estimator to capture both local details and global structural information during diffusion denoising process. 3D MedDiffusion can generate fine-detailed, high-resolution images (up to 512x512x512) and effectively adapt to various downstream tasks as it is trained on large-scale datasets covering CT and MRI modalities and different anatomical regions (from head to leg). Experimental results demonstrate that 3D MedDiffusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generative quality and exhibits strong generalizability across tasks such as sparse-view CT reconstruction, fast MRI reconstruction, and data augmentation for segmentation and classification.

Current foundation models either lack volumetric awareness or suffer from limited interactive capabilities. We propose a training strategy that combines dynamic volumetric prompt generation with content-aware adaptive cropping to optimize the use of the image encoder. Our method simulates realistic user interaction patterns during training while addressing the computational challenges of learning from sequential refinement feedback on a single GPU. For efficient training, we initialize our network using the publicly available weights from the nnInteractive segmentation model. Evaluation on the \textbf{Foundation Models for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation} competition demonstrates strong performance with an average final Dice score of 0.6385, normalized surface distance of 0.6614, and area-under-the-curve metrics of 2.4799 (Dice) and 2.5671 (NSD).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multilingual Training-Free Remote Sensing Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00887v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image captioning has advanced rapidly through encoder--decoder models, although the reliance on large annotated datasets and the focus on English restricts global applicability. To address these limitations, we propose the first training-free multilingual approach, based on retrieval-augmented prompting. For a given aerial image, we employ a domain-adapted SigLIP2 encoder to retrieve related captions and few-shot examples from a datastore, which are then provided to a language model. We explore two variants: an image-blind setup, where a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) generates the caption from textual prompts alone, and an image-aware setup, where a Vision--Language Model (VLM) jointly processes the prompt and the input image. To improve the coherence of the retrieved content, we introduce a graph-based re-ranking strategy using PageRank on a graph of images and captions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets across ten languages demonstrate that our approach is competitive with fully supervised English-only systems and generalizes to other languages. Results also highlight the importance of re-ranking with PageRank, yielding up to 35% improvements in performance metrics. Additionally, it was observed that while VLMs tend to generate visually grounded but lexically diverse captions, LLMs can achieve stronger BLEU and CIDEr scores. Lastly, directly generating captions in the target language consistently outperforms other translation-based strategies. Overall, our work delivers one of the first systematic evaluations of multilingual, training-free captioning for remote sensing imagery, advancing toward more inclusive and scalable multimodal Earth observation systems.</p></details> |  | None |

While re- cent works decouple LoRA update matrices to exploit matrix-wise asymmetry, training costs remain high. We revisit LoRA from the perspective of inter-matrix and intra-layer parameter redundancy and propose Resource-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation, EffiLoRA, a lightweight and generalizable approach for language, multimodal, and diffusion models. EffiLoRA employs a unified A matrix across all transformer layers and introduces a runtime selective B matrices up- date to dynamically trade-off the system resource budget and model performance. EffiLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA across diverse modalities, including commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image generation, demon- strating improved efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Learning to Generate Rigid Body Interactions with Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02284v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models have achieved remarkable progress and are now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack object-level control mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce KineMask, an approach for video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predicted scene descriptions, leading to support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Our experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.

Although multiple low-dose CBCT strategies have been introduced, none have undergone validation using large-scale multicenter retrospective datasets, and prospective clinical evaluation remains lacking. Here, we propose DeepPriorCBCT - a three-stage deep learning framework that achieves diagnostic-grade reconstruction using only one-sixth of the conventional radiation dose. 4102 patients with 8675 CBCT scans from 12 centers were included to develop and validate DeepPriorCBCT. Additionally, a prospective cross-over trial (Registry number: NCT07035977) which recruited 138 patients scheduled for percutaneous thoracic puncture was conducted to assess the model's clinical applicability. Assessment by 11 physicians confirmed that reconstructed images were indistinguishable from original scans. Moreover, diagnostic performance and overall image quality were comparable to those generated by standard reconstruction algorithms. In the prospective trial, five radiologists reported no significant differences in image quality or lesion assessment between DeepPriorCBCT and the clinical standard (all P>0.05). Likewise, 25 interventionalists expressed no preference between model-based and full-sampling images for surgical guidance (Kappa<0.2). Radiation exposure with DeepPriorCBCT was reduced to approximately one-sixth of that with the conventional approach, and collectively, the findings confirm that it enables high-quality CBCT reconstruction under sparse sampling conditions while markedly decreasing intraoperative radiation risk.</p></details> |  | None |

This illustrates a need for a strong, task-agnostic foundation model that requires minimal fine-tuning beyond feature extraction. In this work, we introduce a suite of task-agnostic pretraining of CT foundation models (TAP-CT): a simple yet effective adaptation of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and DINOv2 for volumetric data, enabling scalable self-supervised pretraining directly on 3D CT volumes. Our approach incorporates targeted modifications to patch embeddings, positional encodings, and volumetric augmentations, making the architecture depth-aware while preserving the simplicity of the underlying architectures. We show that large-scale 3D pretraining on an extensive in-house CT dataset (105K volumes) yields stable, robust frozen representations that generalize strongly across downstream tasks. To promote transparency and reproducibility, and to establish a powerful, low-resource baseline for future research in medical imaging, we will release all pretrained models, experimental configurations, and downstream benchmark code at https://huggingface.co/fomofo/tap-ct-b-3d.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

With the advent of visual language models (VLMs), GUI automation has progressed from generating text-based instructions for humans to autonomously executing tasks, thus optimizing automation workflows. Recent approaches leverage VLMs for this problem due to their ability to 1) process on-screen content directly, 2) remain independent of device-specific APIs by utilizing human actions (e.g., clicks, typing), and 3) apply real-world contextual knowledge for task understanding. However, these models often have trouble accurately identifying widgets and determining actions due to limited spatial information in vision encoder features. Additionally, top-performing models are often large, requiring extensive training and resulting in inference delays. In this work, we introduce AFRAgent, an instruct-BLIP-based multimodal architecture that achieves superior performance in GUI automation while being less than one-fourth the size of its nearest competitor. To enhance image embeddings in the large language model (LLM) pipeline, we propose an adaptive feature renormalization-based (a token-level affine transformation) technique that effectively enriches low-resolution image embeddings and fuses high-resolution details. We evaluate AFRAgent on Meta-GUI and AITW benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art baseline for smartphone automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026 Conference</p></details> | None |
| **[VoQA: Visual-only Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14227v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual understanding requires interpreting both natural scenes and the textual information that appears within them, motivating tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, current VQA benchmarks overlook scenarios with visually embedded questions, whereas advanced agents should be able to see the question without separate text input as humans. We introduce Visual-only Question Answering (VoQA), where both the scene and the question appear within a single image, requiring models to perceive and reason purely through vision. This setting supports more realistic visual understanding and interaction in scenarios where questions or instructions are embedded directly in the visual scene. Evaluations under pure visual-only zero-shot, prompt-guided and OCR-assisted settings show that current models exhibit a clear performance drop compared to traditional VQA. To address this, we investigate question-alignment fine-tuning strategies designed to guide models toward interpreting the visual question prior to reasoning. Leveraging VoQA dataset together with these strategies yields robust vision-only reasoning while preserving cross-task generalization to traditional VQA, reflecting the complementary visual and textual reasoning capabilities fostered through VoQA training. The code and data are publicly available.</p></details> | 21 pages | None |

We present Med-CMR, a fine-grained Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning benchmark. Med-CMR distinguishes from existing counterparts by three core features: 1) Systematic capability decomposition, splitting medical multimodal reasoning into fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning to enable targeted evaluation; 2) Challenging task design, with visual understanding across three key dimensions (small-object detection, fine-detail discrimination, spatial understanding) and reasoning covering four clinically relevant scenarios (temporal prediction, causal reasoning, long-tail generalization, multi-source integration); 3) Broad, high-quality data coverage, comprising 20,653 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs spanning 11 organ systems and 12 imaging modalities, validated via a rigorous two-stage (human expert + model-assisted) review to ensure clinical authenticity. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs with Med-CMR, revealing GPT-5 as the top-performing commercial model: 57.81 accuracy on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a 48.70 open-ended score, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro (49.87 MCQ accuracy, 45.98 open-ended score) and leading open-source model Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (49.34 MCQ accuracy, 42.62 open-ended score). However, specialized medical MLLMs do not reliably outperform strong general models, and long-tail generalization emerges as the dominant failure mode. Med-CMR thus provides a stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, and a rigorous yardstick for future clinical systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing image restoration (IR) methods rely on pixel-level hard-fitting to ground-truth images, struggling with over-smoothing and poor generalization. To address these limitations, we propose IRPO, a low-level GRPO-based post-training paradigm that systematically explores both data formulation and reward modeling. We first explore a data formulation principle for low-level post-training paradigm, in which selecting underperforming samples from the pre-training stage yields optimal performance and improved efficiency. Furthermore, we model a reward-level criteria system that balances objective accuracy and human perceptual preference through three complementary components: a General Reward for structural fidelity, an Expert Reward leveraging Qwen-VL for perceptual alignment, and a Restoration Reward for task-specific low-level quality. Comprehensive experiments on six in-domain and five out-of-domain (OOD) low-level benchmarks demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse degradation types, surpassing the AdaIR baseline by 0.83 dB on in-domain tasks and 3.43 dB on OOD settings.

Unlike previous LLM-jailbreak methods that directly orient to LLMs, our approach begins by constructing a multimodal large language model (MLLM) built upon the target LLM. Subsequently, we perform an efficient MLLM jailbreak and obtain a jailbreaking embedding. Finally, we convert the embedding into a textual jailbreaking suffix to carry out the jailbreak of target LLM. Compared to the direct LLM-jailbreak methods, our indirect jailbreaking approach is more efficient, as MLLMs are more vulnerable to jailbreak than pure LLM. Additionally, to improve the attack success rate of jailbreak, we propose an image-text semantic matching scheme to identify a suitable initial input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art jailbreak methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior cross-class generalization abilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Current fairness interventions often adopt a difference-unaware perspective that enforces uniform treatment across demographic groups. These approaches, however, fail to distinguish between contexts where neutrality is required and those where group-specific attributes are legitimate and must be preserved. Building upon recent advances in difference-aware fairness for text-only models, we extend this concept to the multimodal domain and formalize the problem of difference-aware gender fairness for image captioning and text-to-image generation. We advocate for selective debiasing, which aims to mitigate unwanted bias in neutral contexts while preserving valid distinctions in explicit ones. To achieve this, we propose BioPro (Bias Orthogonal Projection), an entirely training-free framework. BioPro identifies a low-dimensional gender-variation subspace through counterfactual embeddings and applies projection to selectively neutralize gender-related information. Experiments show that BioPro effectively reduces gender bias in neutral cases while maintaining gender faithfulness in explicit ones, thus providing a promising direction toward achieving selective fairness in VLMs. Beyond gender bias, we further demonstrate that BioPro can effectively generalize to continuous bias variables, such as scene brightness, highlighting its broader applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, applying these tools to scientific charts rests on a flawed assumption: a chart is not merely an arrangement of pixels but a visual representation of structured data governed by a graphical grammar. Consequently, chart editing is not a pixel-manipulation task but a structured transformation problem. To address this fundamental mismatch, we introduce \textit{FigEdit}, a large-scale benchmark for scientific figure editing comprising over 30,000 samples. Grounded in real-world data, our benchmark is distinguished by its diversity, covering 10 distinct chart types and a rich vocabulary of complex editing instructions. The benchmark is organized into five distinct and progressively challenging tasks: single edits, multi edits, conversational edits, visual-guidance-based edits, and style transfer. Our evaluation of a range of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their poor performance on scientific figures, as they consistently fail to handle the underlying structured transformations required for valid edits. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that traditional evaluation metrics (e.g., SSIM, PSNR) have limitations in capturing the semantic correctness of chart edits. Our benchmark demonstrates the profound limitations of pixel-level manipulation and provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating future structure-aware models. By releasing \textit{FigEdit} (https://github.com/adobe-research/figure-editing), we aim to enable systematic progress in structure-aware figure editing, provide a common ground for fair comparison, and encourage future research on models that understand both the visual and semantic layers of scientific charts.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/adobe-research/figure-editing) |

A promising direction is learning high-level, symbolic abstractions of the low-level skills of the agents, enabling reasoning and planning independent of the low-level state space. Among possible high-level representations, object-centric skill abstraction with symbolic predicates has been proven to be efficient because of its compatibility with domain-independent planners. Recent advances in foundation models have made it possible to generate symbolic predicates that operate on raw sensory inputs, a process we call generative predicate invention, to facilitate downstream abstraction learning. However, it remains unclear which formal properties the learned representations must satisfy, and how they can be learned to guarantee these properties. In this paper, we address both questions by presenting a formal theory of generative predicate invention for skill abstraction, resulting in symbolic operators that can be used for provably sound and complete planning. Within this framework, we propose SkillWrapper, a method that leverages foundation models to actively collect robot data and learn human-interpretable, plannable representations of black-box skills, using only RGB image observations. Our extensive empirical evaluation in simulation and on real robots shows that SkillWrapper learns abstract representations that enable solving unseen, long-horizon tasks in the real world with black-box skills.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, previous works formulated the multi-rater medical image segmentation task, where multiple experts provide separate annotations for each image. However, existing models are typically constrained to either generate diverse segmentation that lacks expert specificity or to produce personalized outputs that merely replicate individual annotators. We propose Probabilistic modeling of multi-rater medical image Segmentation (ProSeg) that simultaneously enables both diversification and personalization. Specifically, we introduce two latent variables to model expert annotation preferences and image boundary ambiguity. Their conditional probabilistic distributions are then obtained through variational inference, allowing segmentation outputs to be generated by sampling from these distributions. Extensive experiments on both the nasopharyngeal carcinoma dataset (NPC) and the lung nodule dataset (LIDC-IDRI) demonstrate that our ProSeg achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, providing segmentation results that are both diverse and expert-personalized.

(1) \textit{Shared credit assignment}: trajectory-level advantages derived from group-normalized sparse terminal rewards are uniformly applied across timesteps, failing to accurately estimate the potential of early denoising steps with vast exploration spaces. (2) \textit{Reward-mixing}: predefined weights for combining multi-objective rewards (e.g., text accuracy, visual quality, text color)--which have mismatched scales and variances--lead to unstable gradients and conflicting updates. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Multi-GRPO}, a multi-group advantage estimation framework with two orthogonal grouping mechanisms. For better credit assignment, we introduce tree-based trajectories inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search: branching trajectories at selected early denoising steps naturally forms \emph{temporal groups}, enabling accurate advantage estimation for early steps via descendant leaves while amortizing computation through shared prefixes. For multi-objective optimization, we introduce \emph{reward-based grouping} to compute advantages for each reward function \textit{independently} before aggregation, disentangling conflicting signals. To facilitate evaluation of multiple objective alignment, we curate \textit{OCR-Color-10}, a visual text rendering dataset with explicit color constraints. Across the single-reward \textit{PickScore-25k} and multi-objective \textit{OCR-Color-10} benchmarks, Multi-GRPO achieves superior stability and alignment performance, effectively balancing conflicting objectives.

However, due to the inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba architecture that maintains information consistency during feature transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods while maintaining model efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |

This limitation arises from their assumption of a fixed underlying data distribution, which may fail to meet user needs and provide unsatisfactory clustering outcomes. Our work investigates how multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can be leveraged to achieve user-driven clustering, emphasizing their adaptability to user-specified semantic requirements. However, directly using MLLM output for clustering has risks for producing unstructured and generic image descriptions instead of feature-specific and concrete ones. To address these issues, our method first discovers that MLLMs' hidden states of text tokens are strongly related to the corresponding features, and leverages these embeddings to perform clusterings from any user-defined criteria. We also employ a lightweight clustering head augmented with pseudo-label learning, significantly enhancing clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate its competitive performance on diverse datasets and metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent object-centric paradigms significantly improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both latency and memory cost by more than 9.3%.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing IIS methods, primarily designed for natural images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing domains due to limited annotated data and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we proposed RS-ISRefiner, a novel click-based IIS framework tailored for remote sensing images. The framework employs an adapter-based tuning strategy that preserves the general representations of Vision Foundation Models while enabling efficient learning of remote sensing-specific spatial and boundary characteristics. A hybrid attention mechanism integrating convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning enhances robustness against scale diversity and scene complexity. Furthermore, an improved probability map modulation scheme effectively incorporates historical user interactions, yielding more stable iterative refinement and higher boundary fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets, including iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban and WHUBuilding, demonstrate that RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and interaction cost. These results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework, making it highly suitable for high-quality instance segmentation in practical remote sensing scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Concept-Guided Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00713v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal text generation, yet their rapid adoption raises increasing concerns about security vulnerabilities. Existing backdoor attacks against VLMs primarily rely on explicit pixel-level triggers or imperceptible perturbations injected into images. While effective, these approaches reduce stealthiness and remain vulnerable to image-based defenses. We introduce concept-guided backdoor attacks, a new paradigm that operates at the semantic concept level rather than on raw pixels. We propose two different attacks. The first, Concept-Thresholding Poisoning (CTP), uses explicit concepts in natural images as triggers: only samples containing the target concept are poisoned, causing the model to behave normally in all other cases but consistently inject malicious outputs whenever the concept appears. The second, CBL-Guided Unseen Backdoor (CGUB), leverages a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) during training to intervene on internal concept activations, while discarding the CBM branch at inference time to keep the VLM unchanged. This design enables systematic replacement of a targeted label in generated text (for example, replacing "cat" with "dog"), even when the replacement behavior never appears in the training data. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures and datasets show that both CTP and CGUB achieve high attack success rates while maintaining moderate impact on clean-task performance. These findings highlight concept-level vulnerabilities as a critical new attack surface for VLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Small Drafts, Big Verdict: Information-Intensive Visual Reasoning via Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20812v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K. By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled high-quality SVG generation by framing the problem as a code generation task and leveraging large-scale pretraining. VLMs are particularly suitable for this task as they capture both global semantics and fine-grained visual patterns, while transferring knowledge across vision, natural language, and code domains. However, existing VLM approaches often struggle to produce faithful and efficient SVGs because they never observe the rendered images during training. Although differentiable rendering for autoregressive SVG code generation remains unavailable, rendered outputs can still be compared to original inputs, enabling evaluative feedback suitable for reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce RLRF (Reinforcement Learning from Rendering Feedback), an RL method that enhances SVG generation in autoregressive VLMs by leveraging feedback from rendered SVG outputs. Given an input image, the model generates SVG roll-outs that are rendered and compared to the original image to compute a reward. This visual fidelity feedback guides the model toward producing more accurate, efficient, and semantically coherent SVGs. RLRF significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning, addressing common failure modes and enabling precise, high-quality SVG generation with strong structural understanding and generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Countering adversarial evasion in regression analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22113v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.</p></details> |  | None |

This study evaluates deep learning models -- YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, and Mask R-CNN -- to automate the process efficiently. A dataset of 582 labeled images was dynamically augmented to improve generalization. Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94), excelling in fine segmentation. YOLOv9 performed well for bounding box detection but struggled with boundary precision. U-Net was effective for structured patterns, while DeepLabV3 captured multi-scale features with slight boundary imprecision. Mask R-CNN initially underperformed due to overlapping detections, but applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) improved its IoU from 0.45 to 0.80. Generalizability was next tested using an oak dataset of 11 images from Oregon State University's Tree Ring Lab. Additionally, for exploratory analysis purposes, an additional dataset of 64 labeled tree cross-sections was used to train the worst-performing model to see if this would improve its performance generalizing to the unseen oak dataset. Key challenges included tensor mismatches and boundary inconsistencies, addressed through hyperparameter tuning and augmentation. Our results highlight deep learning's potential for tree cross-section pith detection, with model choice depending on dataset characteristics and application needs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Adversarial Exploitation of Data Diversity Improves Visual Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00138v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual localization, which estimates a camera's pose within a known scene, is a fundamental capability for autonomous systems. While absolute pose regression (APR) methods have shown promise for efficient inference, they often struggle with generalization. Recent approaches attempt to address this through data augmentation with varied viewpoints, yet they overlook a critical factor: appearance diversity. In this work, we identify appearance variation as the key to robust localization. Specifically, we first lift real 2D images into 3D Gaussian Splats with varying appearance and deblurring ability, enabling the synthesis of diverse training data that varies not just in poses but also in environmental conditions such as lighting and weather. To fully unleash the potential of the appearance-diverse data, we build a two-branch joint training pipeline with an adversarial discriminator to bridge the syn-to-real gap. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing translation and rotation errors by 50\% and 41\% on indoor datasets, and 38\% and 44\% on outdoor datasets. Most notably, our method shows remarkable robustness in dynamic driving scenarios under varying weather conditions and in day-to-night scenarios, where previous APR methods fail.

| **[Uni-X: Mitigating Modality Conflict with a Two-End-Separated Architecture for Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24365v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR) transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs, modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture. Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing, while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for future unified multimodal modeling.

Prior work has used generative models to replicate known category selectivity in isolated regions (e.g., faces in FFA), but these approaches offer limited insight into how regions interact during complex, naturalistic vision. We introduce NeuroVolve, a generative framework that provides brain-guided image synthesis via optimization of a neural objective function in the embedding space of a pretrained vision-language model. Images are generated under the guidance of a programmable neural objective, i.e., activating or deactivating single regions or multiple regions together. NeuroVolve is validated by recovering known selectivity for individual brain regions, while expanding to synthesize coherent scenes that satisfy complex, multi-region constraints. By tracking optimization steps, it reveals semantic trajectories through embedding space, unifying brain-guided image editing and preferred stimulus generation in a single process. We show that NeuroVolve can generate both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli for single ROIs, as well as stimuli aligned to curated neural objectives. These include co-activation and decorrelation between regions, exposing cooperative and antagonistic tuning relationships. Notably, the framework captures subject-specific preferences, supporting personalized brain-driven synthesis and offering interpretable constraints for mapping, analyzing, and probing neural representations of visual information.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MOON: Generative MLLM-based Multimodal Representation Learning for E-commerce Product Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11999v4)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2026. 11 pages, 9 figures</p></details> | None |

However, generalization has become a key challenge and open problem: existing approaches struggle to adapt to emerging generative methods and content types in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Scene-Aware and Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization detection framework with continual learning (SAIDO). Specifically, we design Scene-Awareness-Based Expert Module (SAEM) that dynamically identifies and incorporates new scenes using VLLMs. For each scene, independent expert modules are dynamically allocated, enabling the framework to capture scene-specific forgery features better and enhance cross-scene generalization. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting when learning from multiple image generative methods, we introduce Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization Mechanism (IDOM), which optimizes each neuron through an importance-guided gradient projection strategy, thereby achieving an effective balance between model plasticity and stability. Extensive experiments on continual learning tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms the current SOTA method in both stability and plasticity, achieving 44.22\% and 40.57\% relative reductions in average detection error rate and forgetting rate, respectively. On open-world datasets, it improves the average detection accuracy by 9.47\% compared to the current SOTA method.</p></details> | 17 pages, 19 figures | None |

While existing video diffusion models require large domain-specific datasets and struggle to generalize, recent image generation models trained on language-image corpora exhibit strong compositionality, including the ability to synthesize temporally coherent grid images. This suggests a latent capacity for video-like generation even without explicit temporal modeling. We explore whether such models can serve as visual planners for robots when lightly adapted using LoRA finetuning. We propose a two-part framework that includes: (1) text-conditioned generation, which uses a language instruction and the first frame, and (2) trajectory-conditioned generation, which uses a 2D trajectory overlay and the same initial frame. Experiments on the Jaco Play dataset, Bridge V2, and the RT1 dataset show that both modes produce smooth, coherent robot videos aligned with their respective conditions. Our findings indicate that pretrained image generators encode transferable temporal priors and can function as video-like robotic planners under minimal supervision.

To address this problem, we explore a smartphone-based structured-light system that projects a grid pattern onto the ground and reconstructs local terrain unevenness from a single handheld device. The system is inspired by face-recognition projectors, but adapted for ground sensing. A key technical challenge is robustly matching the projected grid with its deformed observation under perspective distortion and partial occlusion. Conventional one-dimensional dynamic time warping (1D-DTW) is not directly applicable to such two-dimensional grid patterns. We therefore propose a topology-constrained two-dimensional dynamic time warping (2D-DTW) algorithm that performs column-wise alignment under a global grid consistency constraint. The proposed method is designed to be simple enough to run on resource limited platforms while preserving the grid structure required for accurate triangulation. We demonstrate that our 2D-DTW formulation can be used not only for terrain sensing but also as a general tool for matching structured grid patterns in image processing scenarios. This paper describes the overall system design as well as the 2D-DTW extension that emerged from this application.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these developments also raise significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response, training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference, exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other autoregressive paradigms.

Early approaches struggle to generalize due to reliance on specialized models trained on curated small datasets. While recent advancements in large-scale 3D foundation models have significantly enhanced instance-level generation, coherent scene generation remains a challenge, where performance is limited by inaccurate per-object pose estimations and spatial inconsistency. To this end, this paper introduces CC-FMO, a zero-shot, camera-conditioned pipeline for single-image to 3D scene generation that jointly conforms to the object layout in input image and preserves instance fidelity. CC-FMO employs a hybrid instance generator that combines semantics-aware vector-set representation with detail-rich structured latent representation, yielding object geometries that are both semantically plausible and high-quality. Furthermore, CC-FMO enables the application of foundational pose estimation models in the scene generation task via a simple yet effective camera-conditioned scale-solving algorithm, to enforce scene-level coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-FMO consistently generates high-fidelity camera-aligned compositional scenes, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Even on simple T2I tasks, they tend to produce " fake" images with distinct AI artifacts, often characterized by "overly smooth skin" and "oily facial sheens". To recapture the original goal of "indistinguishable-from-reality" generation, we propose RealGen, a photorealistic text-to-image framework. RealGen integrates an LLM component for prompt optimization and a diffusion model for realistic image generation. Inspired by adversarial generation, RealGen introduces a "Detector Reward" mechanism, which quantifies artifacts and assesses realism using both semantic-level and feature-level synthetic image detectors. We leverage this reward signal with the GRPO algorithm to optimize the entire generation pipeline, significantly enhancing image realism and detail. Furthermore, we propose RealBench, an automated evaluation benchmark employing Detector-Scoring and Arena-Scoring. It enables human-free photorealism assessment, yielding results that are more accurate and aligned with real user experience. Experiments demonstrate that RealGen significantly outperforms general models like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image, as well as specialized photorealistic models like FLUX-Krea, in terms of realism, detail, and aesthetics.

However, ensuring robustness against adversarial perturbations remains a critical challenge. Recent efforts have explored both supervised and unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning strategies. We identify two key limitations in these approaches: (i) they often suffer from instability, especially during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal convergence and degraded performance on clean data, and (ii) they exhibit a suboptimal trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy, hindering the simultaneous optimization of both objectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization, which offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as improving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing embedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data performance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that LORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal degradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in out-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image embeddings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, applying this powerful methodology to the next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm remains challenging. The primary obstacle is the low correlation between the reward of an image decoded from an intermediate token sequence and the reward of the fully generated image. Consequently, these incomplete intermediate representations prove to be poor indicators for guiding the pruning direction, a limitation that stems from their inherent incompleteness in scale or semantic content. To effectively address this critical issue, we introduce the Filling-Based Reward (FR). This novel design estimates the approximate future trajectory of an intermediate sample by finding and applying a reasonable filling scheme to complete the sequence. Both the correlation coefficient between rewards of intermediate samples and final samples, as well as multiple intrinsic signals like token confidence, indicate that the FR provides an excellent and reliable metric for accurately evaluating the quality of intermediate samples. Building upon this foundation, we propose FR-TTS, a sophisticated scaling strategy. FR-TTS efficiently searches for good filling schemes and incorporates a diversity reward with a dynamic weighting schedule to achieve a balanced and comprehensive evaluation of intermediate samples. We experimentally validate the superiority of FR-TTS over multiple established benchmarks and various reward models.

When directly applied to real-world CXRs having only been trained with synthetic data, the classifier achieved an AUROC of 0.923 (95% CI: 0.919 - 0.927), and an AUPR of 0.900 (95% CI: 0.894 - 0.907) in recognizing pneumonia in the 2018 RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset (14,863 CXRs), and an AUROC of 0.824 (95% CI: 0.810 - 0.836), and an AUPR of 0.913 (95% CI: 0.904 - 0.922) in the Chest X-Ray dataset (5,856 CXRs). These external validation results on real-world data demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and suggest potential for synthetic data in medical AI development. Nonetheless, several limitations remain at present, including challenges in prompt design for controlling the diversity of synthetic CXR data and the requirement for post-processing to ensure alignment with real-world data.

However, these frameworks are often confined to narrow application domains, offer limited real-time interaction with researchers, and lack principled mechanisms for determining when to halt exploration, resulting in inefficiencies, reproducibility challenges, and under-utilized human expertise. To address these gaps, we propose \textit{SelfAI}, a general multi-agent platform that combines a User Agent for translating high-level research objectives into standardized experimental configurations, a Cognitive Agent powered by LLMs with optimal stopping criteria to iteratively refine hyperparameter searches, and an Experiment Manager responsible for orchestrating parallel, fault-tolerant training workflows across heterogeneous hardware while maintaining a structured knowledge base for continuous feedback. We further introduce two novel evaluation metrics, Score and $\text{AUP}_D$, to quantify discovery efficiency and search diversity. Across regression, NLP, computer vision, scientific computing, medical imaging, and drug discovery benchmarks, SelfAI consistently achieves strong performance and reduces redundant trials compared to classical Bayesian optimization and LLM-based baselines, while enabling seamless interaction with human researchers.</p></details> |  | None |

Prevailing paradigms are forced into a compromise. Embedding prediction methods introduce a conflicting pixel-level objective that degrades the MLLM's general dialogue abilities. The alternative, next-token prediction, reframes segmentation as an autoregressive task, which preserves dialogue but forces a trade-off between poor segmentation performance with sparse outputs or prohibitive inference speeds with rich ones. We resolve this trilemma with all-mask prediction, a novel paradigm that decouples autoregressive dialogue generation from non-autoregressive mask prediction. We present STAMP: Simultaneous Textual All-Mask Prediction, an MLLM that embodies this paradigm. After generating a textual response, STAMP predicts an entire segmentation mask in a single forward pass by treating it as a parallel "fill-in-the-blank" task over image patches. This design maintains the MLLM's dialogue ability by avoiding conflicting objectives, enables high segmentation performance by leveraging rich, bidirectional spatial context for all mask tokens, and achieves exceptional speed. Extensive experiments show that STAMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple segmentation benchmarks, providing a solution that excels in dialogue, segmentation, and speed without compromise.</p></details> |  | None |

Drawing an analogy to human cognitive creation, WiseEdit decomposes image editing into three cascaded steps, i.e., Awareness, Interpretation, and Imagination, each corresponding to a task that poses a challenge for models to complete at the specific step. It also encompasses complex tasks, where none of the three steps can be finished easily. Furthermore, WiseEdit incorporates three fundamental types of knowledge: Declarative, Procedural, and Metacognitive knowledge. Ultimately, WiseEdit comprises 1,220 test cases, objectively revealing the limitations of SoTA image editing models in knowledge-based cognitive reasoning and creative composition capabilities. The benchmark, evaluation code, and the generated images of each model will be made publicly available soon.

| **[Pore-scale Image Patch Dataset and A Comparative Evaluation of Pore-scale Facial Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00381v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The weak-texture nature of facial skin regions presents significant challenges for local descriptor matching in applications such as facial motion analysis and 3D face reconstruction. Although deep learning-based descriptors have demonstrated superior performance to traditional hand-crafted descriptors in many applications, the scarcity of pore-scale image patch datasets has hindered their further development in the facial domain. In this paper, we propose the PorePatch dataset, a high-quality pore-scale image patch dataset, and establish a rational evaluation benchmark. We introduce a Data-Model Co-Evolution (DMCE) framework to generate a progressively refined, high-quality dataset from high-resolution facial images. We then train existing SOTA models on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments. Our results show that the SOTA model achieves a FPR95 value of 1.91% on the matching task, outperforming PSIFT (22.41%) by a margin of 20.5%. However, its advantage is diminished in the 3D reconstruction task, where its overall performance is not significantly better than that of traditional descriptors. This indicates that deep learning descriptors still have limitations in addressing the challenges of facial weak-texture regions, and much work remains to be done in this field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross-Cancer Knowledge Transfer in WSI-based Prognosis Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13482v3)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for estimating cancer prognosis. Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm in which each cancer corresponds to a single model. However, this paradigm naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot leverage knowledge from other cancers. While multi-task learning frameworks have been explored recently, they often place high demands on computational resources and require extensive training on ultra-large, multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper shifts the paradigm to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It comprises three major parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors). (2) Beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmarking, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism behind transferability. (3) We further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. CROPKT could serve as an inception that lays the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

| **[AnomalyCLIP: Object-agnostic Prompt Learning for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18961v11)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) requires detection models trained using auxiliary data to detect anomalies without any training sample in a target dataset. It is a crucial task when training data is not accessible due to various concerns, eg, data privacy, yet it is challenging since the models need to generalize to anomalies across different domains where the appearance of foreground objects, abnormal regions, and background features, such as defects/tumors on different products/organs, can vary significantly. Recently large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong zero-shot recognition ability in various vision tasks, including anomaly detection. However, their ZSAD performance is weak since the VLMs focus more on modeling the class semantics of the foreground objects rather than the abnormality/normality in the images. In this paper we introduce a novel approach, namely AnomalyCLIP, to adapt CLIP for accurate ZSAD across different domains. The key insight of AnomalyCLIP is to learn object-agnostic text prompts that capture generic normality and abnormality in an image regardless of its foreground objects. This allows our model to focus on the abnormal image regions rather than the object semantics, enabling generalized normality and abnormality recognition on diverse types of objects. Large-scale experiments on 17 real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AnomalyCLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance of detecting and segmenting anomalies in datasets of highly diverse class semantics from various defect inspection and medical imaging domains.

| **[Remote Sensing-Oriented World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17808v3)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have shown potential in artificial intelligence by predicting and reasoning about world states beyond direct observations. However, existing approaches are predominantly evaluated in synthetic environments or constrained scene settings, limiting their validation in real-world contexts with broad spatial coverage and complex semantics. Meanwhile, remote sensing applications urgently require spatial reasoning capabilities for disaster response and urban planning. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing the first framework for world modeling in remote sensing. We formulate remote sensing world modeling as direction-conditioned spatial extrapolation, where models generate semantically consistent adjacent image tiles given a central observation and directional instruction. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop RSWISE (Remote Sensing World-Image Spatial Evaluation), a benchmark containing 1,600 evaluation tasks across four scenarios: general, flood, urban, and rural. RSWISE combines visual fidelity assessment with instruction compliance evaluation using GPT-4o as a semantic judge, ensuring models genuinely perform spatial reasoning rather than simple replication. Afterwards, we present RemoteBAGEL, a unified multimodal model fine-tuned on remote sensing data for spatial extrapolation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RemoteBAGEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RSWISE.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5. Meanwhile, LAT not only outperforms the supervised fine-tuning baseline, which is trained to directly produce answers with attribution, but also exhibits stronger generalization across domains.</p></details> | Poster of AAAI'2026 | None |

While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow, liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input.

Despite their strong performance in general T2I tasks, our research reveals that these models initially struggle with subject-driven image generation compared to dominant diffusion models. To address this limitation, we introduce Proxy-Tuning, leveraging diffusion models to enhance AR models' capabilities in subject-specific image generation. Our method reveals a striking weak-to-strong phenomenon: fine-tuned AR models consistently outperform their diffusion model supervisors in both subject fidelity and prompt adherence. We analyze this performance shift and identify scenarios where AR models excel, particularly in multi-subject compositions and contextual understanding. This work not only demonstrates impressive results in subject-driven AR image generation, but also unveils the potential of weak-to-strong generalization in the image generation domain, contributing to a deeper understanding of different architectures' strengths and limitations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Optimizing Distributional Geometry Alignment with Optimal Transport for Generative Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00308v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a compact distilled dataset, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance comparable to models trained on the full dataset. Recent methods for large-scale datasets focus on matching global distributional statistics (e.g., mean and variance), but overlook critical instance-level characteristics and intraclass variations, leading to suboptimal generalization. We address this limitation by reformulating dataset distillation as an Optimal Transport (OT) distance minimization problem, enabling fine-grained alignment at both global and instance levels throughout the pipeline. OT offers a geometrically faithful framework for distribution matching. It effectively preserves local modes, intra-class patterns, and fine-grained variations that characterize the geometry of complex, high-dimensional distributions. Our method comprises three components tailored for preserving distributional geometry: (1) OT-guided diffusion sampling, which aligns latent distributions of real and distilled images; (2) label-image-aligned soft relabeling, which adapts label distributions based on the complexity of distilled image distributions; and (3) OT-based logit matching, which aligns the output of student models with soft-label distributions. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in an efficient manner, achieving at least 4% accuracy improvement under IPC=10 settings for each architecture on ImageNet-1K.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |
| **[Cross Modal Fine-Grained Alignment via Granularity-Aware and Region-Uncertain Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07710v3)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained image-text alignment is a pivotal challenge in multimodal learning, underpinning key applications such as visual question answering, image captioning, and vision-language navigation. Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Comparative Evaluation of Generative AI Models for Chest Radiograph Report Generation in the Emergency Department](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00271v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To benchmark open-source or commercial medical image-specific VLMs against real-world radiologist-written reports. Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients who presented to the emergency department between January 2022 and April 2025 and underwent same-day CXR and CT for febrile or respiratory symptoms. Reports from five VLMs (AIRead, Lingshu, MAIRA-2, MedGemma, and MedVersa) and radiologist-written reports were randomly presented and blindly evaluated by three thoracic radiologists using four criteria: RADPEER, clinical acceptability, hallucination, and language clarity. Comparative performance was assessed using generalized linear mixed models, with radiologist-written reports treated as the reference. Finding-level analyses were also performed with CT as the reference. Results: A total of 478 patients (median age, 67 years [interquartile range, 50-78]; 282 men [59.0%]) were included. AIRead demonstrated the lowest RADPEER 3b rate (5.3% [76/1434] vs. radiologists 13.9% [200/1434]; P<.001), whereas other VLMs showed higher disagreement rates (16.8-43.0%; P<.05). Clinical acceptability was the highest with AIRead (84.5% [1212/1434] vs. radiologists 74.3% [1065/1434]; P<.001), while other VLMs performed worse (41.1-71.4%; P<.05). Hallucinations were rare with AIRead, comparable to radiologists (0.3% [4/1425]) vs. 0.1% [1/1425]; P=.21), but frequent with other models (5.4-17.4%; P<.05). Language clarity was higher with AIRead (82.9% [1189/1434]), Lingshu (88.0% [1262/1434]), and MedVersa (88.4% [1268/1434]) compared with radiologists (78.1% [1120/1434]; P<.05). Sensitivity varied substantially across VLMs for the common findings: AIRead, 15.5-86.7%; Lingshu, 2.4-86.7%; MAIRA-2, 6.0-72.0%; MedGemma, 4.8-76.7%; and MedVersa, 20.2-69.3%. Conclusion: Medical VLMs for CXR report generation exhibited variable performance in report quality and diagnostic measures.</p></details> |  | None |

However, paired pathological-healthy data are extremely difficult to obtain, as they rely on pre- and post-treatment imaging, constrained by clinical outcomes and longitudinal data availability. Consequently, most existing brain image generation and editing methods focus on visual quality yet remain domain-specific, treating pathological and healthy image modeling independently. We introduce USB (Unified Synthetic Brain), the first end-to-end framework that unifies bidirectional generation and editing of pathological and healthy brain images. USB models the joint distribution of lesions and brain anatomy through a paired diffusion mechanism and achieves both pathological and healthy image generation. A consistency guidance algorithm further preserves anatomical consistency and lesion correspondence during bidirectional pathology-healthy editing. Extensive experiments on six public brain MRI datasets including healthy controls, stroke, and Alzheimer's patients, demonstrate USB's ability to produce diverse and realistic results. By establishing the first unified benchmark for brain image generation and editing, USB opens opportunities for scalable dataset creation and robust neuroimaging analysis.

This work addresses a long-standing limitation in conventional cine MRI, which typically provides only 2D slice images of the heart, thereby restricting a comprehensive understanding of cardiac morphology and physiological mechanisms in both healthy and pathological conditions. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{HeartFormer}, a novel point cloud completion network that extends traditional single-class point cloud completion to the multi-class. HeartFormer consists of two key components: a Semantic-Aware Dual-Structure Transformer Network (SA-DSTNet) and a Semantic-Aware Geometry Feature Refinement Transformer Network (SA-GFRTNet). SA-DSTNet generates an initial coarse point cloud with both global geometry features and substructure geometry features. Guided by these semantic-geometry representations, SA-GFRTNet progressively refines the coarse output, effectively leveraging both global and substructure geometric priors to produce high-fidelity and geometrically consistent reconstructions. We further construct \textbf{HeartCompv1}, the first publicly available large-scale dataset with 17,000 high-resolution 3D multi-class cardiac meshes and point-clouds, to establish a general benchmark for this emerging research direction. Extensive cross-domain experiments on HeartCompv1 and UK Biobank demonstrate that HeartFormer achieves robust, accurate, and generalizable performance, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation.

High-quality data plays an important role in driving the development of the 3D understanding community. Current 3D scene understanding datasets often provide geometric and instance-level information, yet they lack the rich semantic annotations necessary for nuanced visual-language tasks.In this work, we introduce DenseScan, a novel dataset with detailed multi-level descriptions generated by an automated pipeline leveraging multi-view 2D images and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach enables dense captioning of scene elements, ensuring comprehensive object-level descriptions that capture context-sensitive details. Furthermore, we extend these annotations through scenario-based question generation, producing high-level queries that integrate object properties, spatial relationships, and scene context. By coupling geometric detail with semantic richness, DenseScan broadens the range of downstream tasks, from detailed visual-language navigation to interactive question answering. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances object-level understanding and question-answering performance in 3D environments compared to traditional annotation pipelines. We release both the annotated dataset and our annotation pipeline to facilitate future research and applications in robotics, augmented reality, and beyond. Through DenseScan, we aim to catalyze new avenues in 3D scene understanding, allowing researchers and practitioners to tackle the complexities of real-world environments with richer, more contextually aware annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce EXP-CAM: an explanation generation and circuit discovery approach using Classifier Activation Matching. EXP-CAM can generate minimal and faithful explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers that not only preserve the model's decision but are also concise and human-readable. We aim to identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight auto-encoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers, consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation. Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal computations driving model decisions.</p></details> |  | None |

This setting is particularly relevant in practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as medical imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the Zero-Shot Neural Compression Denoiser (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression. ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments, we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers. These results further establish the theoretical foundations of compression-based denoising.

We introduce Mammo-FM, the first foundation model specifically for mammography, pretrained on the largest and most diverse dataset to date - 140,677 patients (821,326 mammograms) across four U.S. institutions. Mammo-FM provides a unified foundation for core clinical tasks in breast imaging, including cancer diagnosis, pathology localization, structured report generation, and cancer risk prognosis within a single framework. Its alignment between images and text enables both visual and textual interpretability, improving transparency and clinical auditability, which are essential for real-world adoption. We rigorously evaluate Mammo-FM across diagnosis, prognosis, and report-generation tasks in in- and out-of-distribution datasets. Despite operating on native-resolution mammograms and using only one-third of the parameters of state-of-the-art generalist FMs, Mammo-FM consistently outperforms them across multiple public and private benchmarks. These results highlight the efficiency and value of domain-specific foundation models designed around the full spectrum of tasks within a clinical domain and emphasize the importance of rigorous, domain-aligned evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |

This survey paves the way for innovations in robust chunking pipelines that scale with modality complexity, enhance processing accuracy, and improve generative coherence in real-world applications. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy and technical analysis of chunking strategies tailored for each modality: text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data. We examine classical and modern approaches such as fixed-size token windowing, recursive text splitting, object-centric visual chunking, silence-based audio segmentation, and scene detection in videos. Each approach is analyzed in terms of its underlying methodology, supporting tools (e.g., LangChain, Detectron2, PySceneDetect), benefits, and challenges, particularly those related to granularity-context trade-offs and multimodal alignment. Furthermore, we explore emerging cross-modal chunking strategies that aim to preserve alignment and semantic consistency across disparate data types [4].

In this regard, most existing probability-based UE approaches rely on predefined functions, aggregating token probabilities into a single UE score using heuristics such as length-normalization. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between generated tokens and struggle to identify biased probabilities often influenced by \textbf{language priors}. Another line of research uses hidden representations of the model and trains simple MLP architectures to predict uncertainty. However, such functions often lose the intricate \textbf{ inter-token dependencies}. While prior works show that hidden representations encode multimodal alignment signals, our work demonstrates that how these signals are processed has a significant impact on the UE performance. To effectively leverage these signals to identify inter-token dependencies, and vision-text alignment, we propose \textbf{HARMONY} (Hidden Activation Representations and Model Output-Aware Uncertainty Estimation for Vision-Language Models), a novel UE framework that integrates generated tokens ('text'), model's uncertainty score at the output ('MaxProb'), and its internal belief on the visual understanding of the image and the generated token (captured by 'hidden representations') at token level via appropriate input mapping design and suitable architecture choice. Our experimental experiments across two open-ended VQA benchmarks (A-OKVQA, and VizWiz) and four state-of-the-art VLMs (LLaVA-7B, LLaVA-13B, InstructBLIP, and Qwen-VL) show that HARMONY consistently matches or surpasses existing approaches, achieving up to 5\% improvement in AUROC and 9\% in PRR.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SynPlay: Large-Scale Synthetic Human Data with Real-World Diversity for Aerial-View Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11814v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SynPlay, a large-scale synthetic human dataset purpose-built for advancing multi-perspective human localization, with a predominant focus on aerial-view perception. SynPlay departs from traditional synthetic datasets by addressing a critical but underexplored challenge: localizing humans in aerial scenes where subjects often occupy only tens of pixels in the image. In such scenarios, fine-grained details like facial features or textures become irrelevant, shifting the burden of recognition to human motion, behavior, and interactions. To meet this need, SynPlay implements a novel rule-guided motion generation framework that combines real-world motion capture with motion evolution graphs. This design enables human actions to evolve dynamically through high-level game rules rather than predefined scripts, resulting in effectively uncountable motion variations. Unlike existing synthetic datasets-which either focus on static visual traits or reuse a limited set of mocap-driven actions-SynPlay captures a wide spectrum of spontaneous behaviors, including complex interactions that naturally emerge from unscripted gameplay scenarios. SynPlay also introduces an extensive multi-camera setup that spans UAVs at random altitudes, CCTVs, and a freely roaming UGV, achieving true near-to-far perspective coverage in a single dataset. The majority of instances are captured from aerial viewpoints at varying scales, directly supporting the development of models for long-range human analysis-a setting where existing datasets fall short. Our data contains over 73k images and 6.5M human instances, with detailed annotations for detection, segmentation, and keypoint tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with SynPlay significantly improves human localization performance, especially in few-shot and data-scarce scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://synplaydataset.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Recent progress in machine learning and generative AI has driven growing interest in transforming non-invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) signals into images, text, and audio. This survey consolidates and analyzes developments across EEG-to-image synthesis, EEG-to-text generation, and EEG-to-audio reconstruction. We conducted a structured literature search across major databases (2017-2025), extracting key information on datasets, generative architectures (GANs, VAEs, transformers, diffusion models), EEG feature-encoding techniques, evaluation metrics, and the major challenges shaping current work in this area. Our review finds that EEG-to-image models predominantly employ encoder-decoder architectures built on GANs, VAEs, or diffusion models; EEG-to-text approaches increasingly leverage transformer-based language models for open-vocabulary decoding; and EEG-to-audio methods commonly map EEG signals to mel-spectrograms that are subsequently rendered into audio using neural vocoders. Despite promising advances, the field remains constrained by small and heterogeneous datasets, limited cross-subject generalization, and the absence of standardized benchmarks. By consolidating methodological trends and available datasets, this survey provides a foundational reference for advancing EEG-based generative AI and supporting reproducible research. We further highlight open-source datasets and baseline implementations to facilitate systematic benchmarking and accelerate progress in EEG-driven neural decoding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Visual Generation Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23469v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) effectively bridge the modality gap through extensive pretraining, acquiring sophisticated visual representations aligned with language. However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Project page:https://hunyuan-gamecraft-2.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[DisMo: Disentangled Motion Representations for Open-World Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23428v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

CzechLynx contains 39,760 camera trap images annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and covers 319 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two geographically distinct regions: southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians. In addition to the real camera trap data, we provide a large complementary set of photorealistic synthetic images and a Unity-based generation pipeline with diffusion-based text-to-texture modeling, capable of producing arbitrarily large amounts of synthetic data spanning diverse environments, poses, and coat-pattern variations. To enable systematic testing across realistic ecological scenarios, we define three complementary evaluation protocols: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware closed-set, covering cross-regional and long-term monitoring settings. With the provided resources, CzechLynx offers a unique, flexible benchmark for robust evaluation of computer vision and machine learning models across realistic ecological scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VQRAE: Representation Quantization Autoencoders for Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23386v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying multimodal understanding, generation and reconstruction representation in a single tokenizer remains a key challenge in building unified models. Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures | None |

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations. On top of this dataset, we propose a localization framework that uses a frozen Visual Foundation Model (VFM) together with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning (MFPT) to capture both semantic and frequency-domain cues of edited regions. Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.</p></details> | 13pages,12 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K) |

However, existing methods suffer from fragmented task formulations and limited instruction data, hindering effective understanding and generalization. To address these issues, we introduce GeoSeg-1M, the first million-scale dataset for remote sensing instruction-driven segmentation, constructed via an automatic mask filtering and instruction generation pipeline that synthesizes referring, interactive, and reasoning segmentation instructions from multiple public datasets. GeoSeg-1M contains 590K images, 117 categories, and 1.1M image-mask-instruction triplets. Building upon this foundation, we further curate GeoSeg-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities across diverse instruction-driven tasks and complex geospatial scenes. Furthermore, we present UniGeoSeg, a unified framework that serves as a strong baseline, incorporating task-aware text enhancement, latent knowledge memory, and a progressive training strategy to facilitate multi-task learning.

The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from ${\cal O}(N^2)$ to ${\cal O}(N\log N)$, being $N$ the number of input pixels.</p></details> |  | None |

Since it returns an affine-invariant disparity map, the favored technique to recover the metric depth consists in fine-tuning the model. However, this stage is not straightforward, it can be costly and time-consuming because of the training and the creation of the dataset. The latter must contain images captured by the camera that will be used at test time and the corresponding ground truth. Moreover, the fine-tuning may also degrade the generalizing capacity of the original model. Instead, we propose in this paper a new method to rescale Depth Anything predictions using 3D points provided by sensors or techniques such as low-resolution LiDAR or structure-from-motion with poses given by an IMU. This approach avoids fine-tuning and preserves the generalizing power of the original depth estimation model while being robust to the noise of the sparse depth, of the camera-LiDAR calibration or of the depth model. Our experiments highlight enhancements relative to zero-shot monocular metric depth estimation methods, competitive results compared to fine-tuned approaches and a better robustness than depth completion approaches.

| **[Entropy Rectifying Guidance for Diffusion and Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13987v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance techniques are commonly used in diffusion and flow models to improve image quality and input consistency for conditional generative tasks such as class-conditional and text-to-image generation. In particular, classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the most widely adopted guidance technique. It results, however, in trade-offs across quality, diversity and consistency: improving some at the expense of others. While recent work has shown that it is possible to disentangle these factors to some extent, such methods come with an overhead of requiring an additional (weaker) model, or require more forward passes per sampling step. In this paper, we propose Entropy Rectifying Guidance (ERG), a simple and effective guidance method based on inference-time changes in the attention mechanism of state-of-the-art diffusion transformer architectures, which allows for simultaneous improvements over image quality, diversity and prompt consistency. ERG is more general than CFG and similar guidance techniques, as it extends to unconditional sampling. We show that ERG results in significant improvements in various tasks, including text-to-image, class-conditional and unconditional image generation. We also show that ERG can be seamlessly combined with other recent guidance methods such as CADS and APG, further improving generation results.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

Existing frameworks often mix cognition, memory, and control in a single prompt, reducing coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is proposed as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model handles cognition, memory is stored externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design allows intermediate results to be recorded and verified before actions are taken, improving traceability and evaluation. SCL is evaluated against prompt-based baselines such as ReAct and LangChain agents across three tasks: travel planning, conditional email drafting, and constraint-guided image generation. Under matched settings, SCL achieves an average task success rate of 86.3 percent, compared with 70.5 to 76.8 percent for baselines. It also shows higher goal fidelity, fewer redundant calls, and reduced unsupported assertions. These results indicate that separating cognition, memory, and control can enhance reliability and interpretability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings should be regarded as preliminary evidence, with broader tests across model families and task domains planned for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated the order of the SCL configuration modules to match the diagram</p></details> | None |

We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional diffusion models that transform noise into data, Bridge Models directly model the trajectory between inputs and outputs, creating an efficient data-to-data translation paradigm. By scaling these models to 20B and 1.3B parameters, we demonstrate their effectiveness for image and video translation tasks. To support this scale, we adopt a Transformer architecture and propose a variance-stabilized velocity-matching objective for robust training.

However, it is challenging for children to clearly grasp these multi level links only through explanations of text or the facilitator's speech. To address this, we developed Colin, an interactive storytelling tool that supports children's multi level narrative skills through both voice and visual modalities. In the generation stage, Colin supports the facilitator to define and review the generated text and image content freely. In the understanding stage, a question feedback model helps children understand multi level connections while co creating stories with Colin. In the building phase, Colin actively encourages children to create connections between elements through drawing and speaking. A user study with 20 participants evaluated Colin by measuring children's engagement, understanding of cause and effect relationships, and the quality of their new story creations.

In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical "City-District-Grid" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a "produce-refine-evaluate" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures | None |

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/CoTyle Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Kwai-Kolors/CoTyle Homepage: https://kwai-kolors.github.io/CoTyle/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/CoTyle) |

As 3D training data is generally not as sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation. SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for 3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.6 and +6.8 mAP on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its superiority.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Analyzing Image Beyond Visual Aspect: Image Emotion Classification via Multiple-Affective Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23115v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image emotion classification (IEC) is a longstanding research field that has received increasing attention with the rapid progress of deep learning. Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Autoregressive Styled Text Image Generation, but Make it Reliable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23240v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing. A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones. Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the textual prompt, improving content adherence.</p></details> | Accepted at WACV2026 | None |
| **[On Computational Aspects of Ordered Matching Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23093v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ordered matchings, defined as graphs with linearly ordered vertices, where each vertex is connected to exactly one edge, play a crucial role in the area of ordered graphs and their homomorphisms. Therefore, we consider related problems from the complexity point of view and determine their corresponding computational and parameterized complexities. We show that the subgraph of ordered matchings problem is NP-complete and we prove that the problem of finding ordered homomorphisms between ordered matchings is NP-complete as well, implying NP-completeness of more generic problems. In parameterized complexity setting, we consider a natural choice of parameter - a number of vertices of the image ordered graph. We show that in contrast to the complexity context, finding homomorphisms if the image ordered graph is an ordered matching, this problem parameterized by the number of vertices of the image ordered graph is FPT, which is known to be W[1]-hard for the general problem. We also determine that the problem of core for ordered matchings is solvable in polynomial time which is again in contrast to the NP-completeness of the general problem. We provide several algorithms and generalize some of these problems into ordered graphs with colored edges.</p></details> | Accepted | None |

In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\% and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by NetConEmb. Real-time navigation further confirmed NetConEmb's robustness, achieving a 100\% success rate in both known and unknown environments, while NetEmb and NetGated succeeded only in navigating the known environment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Rendering for Multimodal Autonomous Driving: Merging Neural and Physics-Based Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09464v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural reconstruction models for autonomous driving simulation have made significant strides in recent years, with dynamic models becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity, restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach. TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency.

Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[HiGFA: Hierarchical Guidance for Fine-grained Data Augmentation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12547v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models show promise for data augmentation. However, applying them to fine-grained tasks presents a significant challenge: ensuring synthetic images accurately capture the subtle, category-defining features critical for high fidelity. Standard approaches, such as text-based Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), often lack the required specificity, potentially generating misleading examples that degrade fine-grained classifier performance. To address this, we propose Hierarchically Guided Fine-grained Augmentation (HiGFA). HiGFA leverages the temporal dynamics of the diffusion sampling process. It employs strong text and transformed contour guidance with fixed strengths in the early-to-mid sampling stages to establish overall scene, style, and structure. In the final sampling stages, HiGFA activates a specialized fine-grained classifier guidance and dynamically modulates the strength of all guidance signals based on prediction confidence. This hierarchical, confidence-driven orchestration enables HiGFA to generate diverse yet faithful synthetic images by intelligently balancing global structure formation with precise detail refinement. Experiments on several FGVC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGFA.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Chiplet-Based RISC-V SoC with Modular AI Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18355v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining architectural flexibility is a critical challenge in the development and deployment of edge AI devices. Monolithic SoC designs struggle with this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at advanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based RISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI acceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design integrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer: adaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring streaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed cryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent sensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V CPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory stacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across industry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video processing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized configuration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement, and 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations. These improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain corresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while maintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads. These performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve near-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency, scalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, 3rd IEEE International Conference of Computational Intelligence and Network Systems 2025</p></details> | None |

By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation.

Particularly in medical imaging, where multiple spurious correlations can coexist, misclassifications can have severe consequences. We propose MIMM-X, a framework that disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations by minimizing their mutual information. It enables predictions based on true underlying causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts. We evaluate MIMM-X on three datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) across two imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray). Results demonstrate that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning of multiple spurious correlations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the existing benchmark datasets often focus on the generation with single or a few reference images, which prevents us from measuring the progress on how model performance advances or pointing out their weaknesses, under different multi-reference conditions. In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as "what to edit" or "how many references are given", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering. Our analysis among a variety of text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. MultiBanana will be released as an open benchmark to push the boundaries and establish a standardized basis for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation.

Current state-of-the-art methods learn a single, entangled forgery representation, conflating content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts, and are further constrained by outdated benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system designed to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a novel two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling "what is generated" (content-specific flaws) from "how it is generated" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new and robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, 19 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/showlab/RobotSeg</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/showlab/RobotSeg) |

While diffusion-based data generation methods show promise, they introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks. This paper presents FLEX-Seg (FLexible Edge eXploitation for Segmentation), a framework that transforms this limitation into an opportunity for robust learning. FLEX-Seg comprises three key components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes that captures boundary characteristics across multiple scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that dynamically adjusts learning emphasis based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling that progressively focuses on challenging examples. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations. Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich.

Experiments across 10 LLMs, 10 MLLMs, and one T2IM (Qwen-Image) show that MLLM choice is the primary performance driver: GPT achieves the highest accuracies, Gemini follows, and the best open-source MLLM (Gemma) is competitive with some closed models.

However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation.

In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details. The LWF loss adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in a logarithmic manner, emphasizing challenging high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DenoiseGS significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving \textbf{250$\times$} faster inference speed.

Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality.

| **[Robust Image Self-Recovery against Tampering using Watermark Generation with Pixel Shuffling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22936v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) raises concerns about the authenticity of digital media. In this context, image self-recovery, reconstructing original content from its manipulated version, offers a practical solution for understanding the attacker's intent and restoring trustworthy data. However, existing methods often fail to accurately recover tampered regions, falling short of the primary goal of self-recovery. To address this challenge, we propose ReImage, a neural watermarking-based self-recovery framework that embeds a shuffled version of the target image into itself as a watermark. We design a generator that produces watermarks optimized for neural watermarking and introduce an image enhancement module to refine the recovered image. We further analyze and resolve key limitations of shuffled watermarking, enabling its effective use in self-recovery. We demonstrate that ReImage achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tampering scenarios, consistently producing high-quality recovered images. The code and pretrained models will be released upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures, 14 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Visual Orientalism in the AI Era: From West-East Binaries to English-Language Centrism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22931v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image AI models systematically encode geopolitical bias through visual representation. Drawing on Said's Orientalism and framing theory, we introduce Visual Orientalism -- the dual standard whereby AI depicts Western nations through political-modern symbols while portraying Eastern nations through cultural-traditional symbols. Analyzing 396 AI-generated images across 12 countries and 3 models, we reveal an evolution: Visual Orientalism has shifted from traditional West-versus-East binaries to English-language centrism, where only English-speaking core countries (USA and UK) receive political representation while all other nations -- including European powers -- face cultural exoticization. This algorithmic reconfiguration of Orientalism operates through automated framing mechanisms shaped by the material conditions of AI development: English-language training data dominance and the concentration of AI development in English-speaking tech companies. Our findings demonstrate how AI systems function as agents of cultural representation that perpetuate and intensify historical power asymmetries. Addressing Visual Orientalism requires rethinking of algorithmic governance and the geopolitical structures embedded in AI training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 8 figures, supplementary materials included</p></details> | None |
| **[Artwork Interpretation with Vision Language Models: A Case Study on Emotions and Emotion Symbols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22929v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotions are a fundamental aspect of artistic expression. Due to their abstract nature, there is a broad spectrum of emotion realization in artworks. These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IJCNLP-AACL workshop on Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Contexts and Social Impact</p></details> | None |
| **[Leveraging Textual Compositional Reasoning for Robust Change Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22903v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change captioning aims to describe changes between a pair of images. However, existing works rely on visual features alone, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes because they lack the ability to represent explicitly structured information such as object relationships and compositional semantics. To alleviate this, we present CORTEX (COmpositional Reasoning-aware TEXt-guided), a novel framework that integrates complementary textual cues to enhance change understanding. In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[ARIAL: An Agentic Framework for Document VQA with Precise Answer Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18192v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.</p></details> |  | None |
