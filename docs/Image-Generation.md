| **[MME-Unify: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03641v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing MLLM benchmarks face significant challenges in evaluating Unified MLLMs (U-MLLMs) due to: 1) lack of standardized benchmarks for traditional tasks, leading to inconsistent comparisons; 2) absence of benchmarks for mixed-modality generation, which fails to assess multimodal reasoning capabilities. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to systematically assess U-MLLMs. Our benchmark includes: Standardized Traditional Task Evaluation. We sample from 12 datasets, covering 10 tasks with 30 subtasks, ensuring consistent and fair comparisons across studies." 2. Unified Task Assessment. We introduce five novel tasks testing multimodal reasoning, including image editing, commonsense QA with image generation, and geometric reasoning. 3. Comprehensive Model Benchmarking. We evaluate 12 leading U-MLLMs, such as Janus-Pro, EMU3, VILA-U, and Gemini2-flash, alongside specialized understanding (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and generation models (e.g., DALL-E-3). Our findings reveal substantial performance gaps in existing U-MLLMs, highlighting the need for more robust models capable of handling mixed-modality tasks effectively.

| **[Dynamic Importance in Diffusion U-Net for Enhanced Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03471v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional diffusion models typically employ a U-Net architecture. Previous studies have unveiled the roles of attention blocks in the U-Net. However, they overlook the dynamic evolution of their importance during the inference process, which hinders their further exploitation to improve image applications. In this study, we first theoretically proved that, re-weighting the outputs of the Transformer blocks within the U-Net is a "free lunch" for improving the signal-to-noise ratio during the sampling process. Next, we proposed Importance Probe to uncover and quantify the dynamic shifts in importance of the Transformer blocks throughout the denoising process. Finally, we design an adaptive importance-based re-weighting schedule tailored to specific image generation and editing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the inference process, and enhances the aesthetic quality of the samples with identity consistency. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any U-Net-based architecture.

| **[QIRL: Boosting Visual Question Answering via Optimized Question-Image Relation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03337v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing debiasing approaches in Visual Question Answering (VQA) primarily focus on enhancing visual learning, integrating auxiliary models, or employing data augmentation strategies. However, these methods exhibit two major drawbacks. First, current debiasing techniques fail to capture the superior relation between images and texts because prevalent learning frameworks do not enable models to extract deeper correlations from highly contrasting samples. Second, they do not assess the relevance between the input question and image during inference, as no prior work has examined the degree of input relevance in debiasing studies. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel framework, Optimized Question-Image Relation Learning (QIRL), which employs a generation-based self-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, two modules are introduced to address the aforementioned issues. The Negative Image Generation (NIG) module automatically produces highly irrelevant question-image pairs during training to enhance correlation learning, while the Irrelevant Sample Identification (ISI) module improves model robustness by detecting and filtering irrelevant inputs, thereby reducing prediction errors. Furthermore, to validate our concept of reducing output errors through filtering unrelated question-image inputs, we propose a specialized metric to evaluate the performance of the ISI module. Notably, our approach is model-agnostic and can be integrated with various VQA models. Extensive experiments on VQA-CPv2 and VQA-v2 demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method. Among data augmentation strategies, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Minority-Focused Text-to-Image Generation via Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07838v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the generation of minority samples using pretrained text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models. Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for high-quality generation. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that encourages emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Extensive experiments conducted across various types of T2I models demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.

| **[Training-Free Style and Content Transfer by Leveraging U-Net Skip Connections in Stable Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14524v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models for image generation have led to detailed examinations of several components within the U-Net architecture for image editing. While previous studies have focused on the bottleneck layer (h-space), cross-attention, self-attention, and decoding layers, the overall role of the skip connections of the U-Net itself has not been specifically addressed. We conduct thorough analyses on the role of the skip connections and find that the residual connections passed by the third encoder block carry most of the spatial information of the reconstructed image, splitting the content from the style, passed by the remaining stream in the opposed decoding layer. We show that injecting the representations from this block can be used for text-based editing, precise modifications, and style transfer. We compare our method, SkipInject, to state-of-the-art style transfer and image editing methods and demonstrate that our method obtains the best content alignment and optimal structural preservation tradeoff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR Workshop on AI for Creative Visual Content Generation Editing and Understanding 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[PromptGuard: Soft Prompt-Guided Unsafe Content Moderation for Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03544v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models have been shown to be vulnerable to misuse, particularly in generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 7.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Image Restoration Using Few-Step Guidance of Consistency Models (and Beyond)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20596v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, it has become popular to tackle image restoration tasks with a single pretrained diffusion model (DM) and data-fidelity guidance, instead of training a dedicated deep neural network per task. However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (camera-ready).

| **[VARGPT-v1.1: Improve Visual Autoregressive Large Unified Model via Iterative Instruction Tuning and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02949v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present VARGPT-v1.1, an advanced unified visual autoregressive model that builds upon our previous framework VARGPT. The model preserves the dual paradigm of next-token prediction for visual understanding and next-scale generation for image synthesis. Specifically, VARGPT-v1.1 integrates: (1) a novel training strategy combining iterative visual instruction tuning with reinforcement learning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), (2) an expanded training corpus containing 8.3M visual-generative instruction pairs, (3) an upgraded language model backbone using Qwen2, (4) enhanced image generation resolution, and (5) emergent image editing capabilities without architectural modifications. These advancements enable VARGPT-v1.1 to achieve state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding and text-to-image instruction-following tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in both comprehension and generation metrics. Notably, through visual instruction tuning, the model acquires image editing functionality while maintaining architectural consistency with its predecessor, revealing the potential for unified visual understanding, generation, and editing. Our findings suggest that well-designed unified visual autoregressive models can effectively adopt flexible training strategies from large language models (LLMs), exhibiting promising scalability.

| **[Quantum Generative Models for Image Generation: Insights from MNIST and MedMNIST](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00034v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum generative models offer a promising new direction in machine learning by leveraging quantum circuits to enhance data generation capabilities. In this study, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical image generation framework that integrates variational quantum circuits into a diffusion-based model. To improve training dynamics and generation quality, we introduce two novel noise strategies: intrinsic quantum-generated noise and a tailored noise scheduling mechanism. Our method is built upon a lightweight U-Net architecture, with the quantum layer embedded in the bottleneck module to isolate its effect. We evaluate our model on MNIST and MedMNIST datasets to examine its feasibility and performance. Notably, our results reveal that under limited data conditions (fewer than 100 training images), the quantum-enhanced model generates images with higher perceptual quality and distributional similarity than its classical counterpart using the same architecture. While the quantum model shows advantages on grayscale data such as MNIST, its performance is more nuanced on complex, color-rich datasets like PathMNIST. These findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of quantum generative models and lay the groundwork for future developments in low-resource and biomedical image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GPT-ImgEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Diagnosing GPT4o in Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02782v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent breakthroughs in OpenAI's GPT4o model have demonstrated surprisingly good capabilities in image generation and editing, resulting in significant excitement in the community. This technical report presents the first-look evaluation benchmark (named GPT-ImgEval), quantitatively and qualitatively diagnosing GPT-4o's performance across three critical dimensions: (1) generation quality, (2) editing proficiency, and (3) world knowledge-informed semantic synthesis. Across all three tasks, GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both image generation control and output quality, while also showcasing exceptional knowledge reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, based on the GPT-4o's generated data, we propose a classification-model-based approach to investigate the underlying architecture of GPT-4o, where our empirical results suggest the model consists of an auto-regressive (AR) combined with a diffusion-based head for image decoding, rather than the VAR-like architectures. We also provide a complete speculation on GPT-4o's overall architecture. In addition, we conduct a series of analyses to identify and visualize GPT-4o's specific limitations and the synthetic artifacts commonly observed in its image generation. We also present a comparative study of multi-round image editing between GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, and discuss the safety implications of GPT-4o's outputs, particularly their detectability by existing image forensic models. We hope that our work can offer valuable insight and provide a reliable benchmark to guide future research, foster reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in the field of image generation and beyond.

| **[ILLUME+: Illuminating Unified MLLM with Dual Visual Tokenization and Diffusion Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01934v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ILLUME+ that leverages dual visual tokenization and a diffusion decoder to improve both deep semantic understanding and high-fidelity image generation. Existing unified models have struggled to simultaneously handle the three fundamental capabilities in a unified model: understanding, generation, and editing. Models like Chameleon and EMU3 utilize VQGAN for image discretization, due to the lack of deep semantic interaction, they lag behind specialist models like LLaVA in visual understanding tasks. To mitigate this, LaViT and ILLUME employ semantic encoders for tokenization, but they struggle with image editing due to poor texture preservation. Meanwhile, Janus series decouples the input and output image representation, limiting their abilities to seamlessly handle interleaved image-text understanding and generation. In contrast, ILLUME+ introduces a unified dual visual tokenizer, DualViTok, which preserves both fine-grained textures and text-aligned semantics while enabling a coarse-to-fine image representation strategy for multimodal understanding and generation. Additionally, we employ a diffusion model as the image detokenizer for enhanced generation quality and efficient super-resolution. ILLUME+ follows a continuous-input, discrete-output scheme within the unified MLLM and adopts a progressive training procedure that supports dynamic resolution across the vision tokenizer, MLLM, and diffusion decoder. This design allows for flexible and efficient context-aware image editing and generation across diverse tasks. ILLUME+ (3B) exhibits competitive performance against existing unified MLLMs and specialized models across multimodal understanding, generation, and editing benchmarks. With its strong performance, ILLUME+ provides a scalable and versatile foundation for future multimodal applications.

| **[RoSMM: A Robust and Secure Multi-Modal Watermarking Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02640v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current image watermarking technologies are predominantly categorized into text watermarking techniques and image steganography; however, few methods can simultaneously handle text and image-based watermark data, which limits their applicability in complex digital environments. This paper introduces an innovative multi-modal watermarking approach, drawing on the concept of vector discretization in encoder-based vector quantization. By constructing adjacency matrices, the proposed method enables the transformation of text watermarks into robust image-based representations, providing a novel multi-modal watermarking paradigm for image generation applications. Additionally, this study presents a newly designed image restoration module to mitigate image degradation caused by transmission losses and various noise interferences, thereby ensuring the reliability and integrity of the watermark. Experimental results validate the robustness of the method under multiple noise attacks, providing a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for digital image copyright protection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-Tuning Visual Autoregressive Models for Subject-Driven Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02612v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have enabled numerous practical applications, including subject-driven generation, which fine-tunes pretrained models to capture subject semantics from only a few examples. While diffusion-based models produce high-quality images, their extensive denoising steps result in significant computational overhead, limiting real-world applicability. Visual autoregressive~(VAR) models, which predict next-scale tokens rather than spatially adjacent ones, offer significantly faster inference suitable for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose the first VAR-based approach for subject-driven generation. However, na\"{\i}ve fine-tuning VAR leads to computational overhead, language drift, and reduced diversity. To address these challenges, we introduce selective layer tuning to reduce complexity and prior distillation to mitigate language drift. Additionally, we found that the early stages have a greater influence on the generation of subject than the latter stages, which merely synthesize local details. Based on this finding, we propose scale-wise weighted tuning, which prioritizes coarser resolutions for promoting the model to focus on the subject-relevant information instead of local details. Extensive experiments validate that our method significantly outperforms diffusion-based baselines across various metrics and demonstrates its practical usage.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bias in Large Language Models Across Clinical Applications: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02917v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into healthcare, promising to enhance various clinical tasks. However, concerns exist regarding their potential for bias, which could compromise patient care and exacerbate health inequities. This systematic review investigates the prevalence, sources, manifestations, and clinical implications of bias in LLMs. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, OVID, and EMBASE from database inception through 2025, for studies evaluating bias in LLMs applied to clinical tasks. We extracted data on LLM type, bias source, bias manifestation, affected attributes, clinical task, evaluation methods, and outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified ROBINS-I tool. Results: Thirty-eight studies met inclusion criteria, revealing pervasive bias across various LLMs and clinical applications. Both data-related bias (from biased training data) and model-related bias (from model training) were significant contributors. Biases manifested as: allocative harm (e.g., differential treatment recommendations); representational harm (e.g., stereotypical associations, biased image generation); and performance disparities (e.g., variable output quality). These biases affected multiple attributes, most frequently race/ethnicity and gender, but also age, disability, and language. Conclusions: Bias in clinical LLMs is a pervasive and systemic issue, with a potential to lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, particularly for marginalized patient populations. Rigorous evaluation of the model is crucial. Furthermore, the development and implementation of effective mitigation strategies, coupled with continuous monitoring in real-world clinical settings, are essential to ensure the safe, equitable, and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving Object Detection by Modifying Synthetic Data with Explainable AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01477v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Limited real-world data severely impacts model performance in many computer vision domains, particularly for samples that are underrepresented in training. Synthetically generated images are a promising solution, but 1) it remains unclear how to design synthetic training data to optimally improve model performance (e.g, whether and where to introduce more realism or more abstraction) and 2) the domain expertise, time and effort required from human operators for this design and optimisation process represents a major practical challenge. Here we propose a novel conceptual approach to improve the efficiency of designing synthetic images, by using robust Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to guide a human-in-the-loop process of modifying 3D mesh models used to generate these images. Importantly, this framework allows both modifications that increase and decrease realism in synthetic data, which can both improve model performance. We illustrate this concept using a real-world example where data are sparse; detection of vehicles in infrared imagery. We fine-tune an initial YOLOv8 model on the ATR DSIAC infrared dataset and synthetic images generated from 3D mesh models in the Unity gaming engine, and then use XAI saliency maps to guide modification of our Unity models. We show that synthetic data can improve detection of vehicles in orientations unseen in training by 4.6% (to mAP50 = 94.6%). We further improve performance by an additional 1.5% (to 96.1%) through our new XAI-guided approach, which reduces misclassifications through both increasing and decreasing the realism of different parts of the synthetic data. Our proof-of-concept results pave the way for fine, XAI-controlled curation of synthetic datasets tailored to improve object detection performance, whilst simultaneously reducing the burden on human operators in designing and optimising these datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Geometric Median Matching for Robust k-Subset Selection from Noisy Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00564v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data pruning -- the combinatorial task of selecting a small and representative subset from a large dataset, is crucial for mitigating the enormous computational costs associated with training data-hungry modern deep learning models at scale. Since large scale data collections are invariably noisy, developing data pruning strategies that remain robust even in the presence of corruption is critical in practice. However, existing data pruning methods often fail under high corruption rates due to their reliance on empirical mean estimation, which is highly sensitive to outliers. In response, we propose Geometric Median (GM) Matching, a novel k-subset selection strategy that leverages Geometric Median -- a robust estimator with an optimal breakdown point of 1/2; to enhance resilience against noisy data. Our method iteratively selects a k-subset such that the mean of the subset approximates the GM of the (potentially) noisy dataset, ensuring robustness even under arbitrary corruption. We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that GM Matching enjoys an improved O(1/k) convergence rate -- a quadratic improvement over random sampling, even under arbitrary corruption. Extensive experiments across image classification and image generation tasks demonstrate that GM Matching consistently outperforms existing pruning approaches, particularly in high-corruption settings and at high pruning rates; making it a strong baseline for robust data pruning.</p></details> |  | None |

Crafting effective prompts can, however, be difficult for novice users. To tackle this challenge, we developed PromptMap, a new interaction style for text-to-image AI that allows users to freely explore a vast collection of synthetic prompts through a map-like view with semantic zoom. PromptMap groups images visually by their semantic similarity, allowing users to discover relevant examples. We evaluated PromptMap in a between-subject online study ($n=60$) and a qualitative within-subject study ($n=12$). We found that PromptMap supported users in crafting prompts by providing them with examples. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using LLMs to create vast example collections. Our work contributes a new interaction style that supports users unfamiliar with prompting in achieving a satisfactory image output.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 30th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI '25), March 24-27, 2025, Cagliari, Italy ; Link to code https://github.com/Bill2462/prompt-map</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Bill2462/prompt-map) |

With the advancement in large text-to-image models, many techniques have been developed to efficiently fine-tune those models for personalization, such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, LoRA-based methods often face the challenge of adjusting the rank parameter to achieve satisfactory results. To address this challenge, AutoComponent-LoRA (AC-LoRA) is proposed, which is able to automatically separate the signal component and noise component of the LoRA matrices for fast and efficient personalized artistic style image generation. This method is based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and dynamic heuristics to update the hyperparameters during training. Superior performance over existing methods in overcoming model underfitting or overfitting problems is demonstrated. The results were validated using FID, CLIP, DINO, and ImageReward, achieving an average of 9% improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, ICCGV 2025, SPIE</p></details> | None |
| **[Foreground Focus: Enhancing Coherence and Fidelity in Camouflaged Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02180v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged image generation is emerging as a solution to data scarcity in camouflaged vision perception, offering a cost-effective alternative to data collection and labeling. Recently, the state-of-the-art approach successfully generates camouflaged images using only foreground objects. However, it faces two critical weaknesses: 1) the background knowledge does not integrate effectively with foreground features, resulting in a lack of foreground-background coherence (e.g., color discrepancy); 2) the generation process does not prioritize the fidelity of foreground objects, which leads to distortion, particularly for small objects. To address these issues, we propose a Foreground-Aware Camouflaged Image Generation (FACIG) model. Specifically, we introduce a Foreground-Aware Feature Integration Module (FAFIM) to strengthen the integration between foreground features and background knowledge. In addition, a Foreground-Aware Denoising Loss is designed to enhance foreground reconstruction supervision. Experiments on various datasets show our method outperforms previous methods in overall camouflaged image quality and foreground fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

For the first challenge, moving from curating single-subject datasets to multiple-subject ones and scaling them is particularly difficult. For the second, most recent methods center on single-subject generation, making it hard to apply when dealing with multi-subject scenarios. In this study, we propose a highly-consistent data synthesis pipeline to tackle this challenge. This pipeline harnesses the intrinsic in-context generation capabilities of diffusion transformers and generates high-consistency multi-subject paired data. Additionally, we introduce UNO, which consists of progressive cross-modal alignment and universal rotary position embedding. It is a multi-image conditioned subject-to-image model iteratively trained from a text-to-image model.

Tokenizer training typically follows a standard recipe in which images are compressed and reconstructed subject to a combination of MSE, perceptual, and adversarial losses. Diffusion autoencoders have been proposed in prior work as a way to learn end-to-end perceptually-oriented image compression, but have not yet shown state-of-the-art performance on the competitive task of ImageNet-1K reconstruction. We propose FlowMo, a transformer-based diffusion autoencoder that achieves a new state-of-the-art for image tokenization at multiple compression rates without using convolutions, adversarial losses, spatially-aligned two-dimensional latent codes, or distilling from other tokenizers. Our key insight is that FlowMo training should be broken into a mode-matching pre-training stage and a mode-seeking post-training stage. In addition, we conduct extensive analyses and explore the training of generative models atop the FlowMo tokenizer. Our code and models will be available at http://kylesargent.github.io/flowmo .</p></details> | 18 pages, 13 figures | [Code Link](http://kylesargent.github.io/flowmo) |
| **[FineLIP: Extending CLIP's Reach via Fine-Grained Alignment with Longer Text Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01916v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a pioneering vision-language model, CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has achieved significant success across various domains and a wide range of downstream vision-language tasks. However, the text encoders in popular CLIP models are limited to processing only 77 text tokens, which constrains their ability to effectively handle longer, detail-rich captions. Additionally, CLIP models often struggle to effectively capture detailed visual and textual information, which hampers their performance on tasks that require fine-grained analysis. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach, \textbf{FineLIP}, that extends the capabilities of CLIP. FineLIP enhances cross-modal text-image mapping by incorporating \textbf{Fine}-grained alignment with \textbf{L}onger text input within the CL\textbf{IP}-style framework. FineLIP first extends the positional embeddings to handle longer text, followed by the dynamic aggregation of local image and text tokens. The aggregated results are then used to enforce fine-grained token-to-token cross-modal alignment. We validate our model on datasets with long, detailed captions across two tasks: zero-shot cross-modal retrieval and text-to-image generation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FineLIP, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes with multiple objects remains challenging. Therefore, we present DreamScape, a method for generating 3D scenes from text. Utilizing Gaussian Splatting for 3D representation, DreamScape introduces 3D Gaussian Guide that encodes semantic primitives, spatial transformations and relationships from text using LLMs, enabling local-to-global optimization. Progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, addressing training instability issue arising from simple blending in the global optimization stage. Collision relationships between objects are modeled at the global level to mitigate biases in LLMs priors, ensuring physical correctness. Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we design specialized sparse initialization and densification strategy. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScape achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling high-fidelity, controllable 3D scene generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Instance Migration Diffusion for Nuclear Instance Segmentation in Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01577v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear instance segmentation plays a vital role in disease diagnosis within digital pathology. However, limited labeled data in pathological images restricts the overall performance of nuclear instance segmentation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation framework Instance Migration Diffusion Model (IM-Diffusion), IM-Diffusion designed to generate more varied pathological images by constructing diverse nuclear layouts and internuclear spatial relationships. In detail, we introduce a Nuclear Migration Module (NMM) which constructs diverse nuclear layouts by simulating the process of nuclear migration. Building on this, we further present an Internuclear-regions Inpainting Module (IIM) to generate diverse internuclear spatial relationships by structure-aware inpainting. On the basis of the above, IM-Diffusion generates more diverse pathological images with different layouts and internuclear spatial relationships, thereby facilitating downstream tasks. Evaluation on the CoNSeP and GLySAC datasets demonstrate that the images generated by IM-Diffusion effectively enhance overall instance segmentation performance. Code will be made public later.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[High-fidelity 3D Object Generation from Single Image with RGBN-Volume Gaussian Reconstruction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01512v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently single-view 3D generation via Gaussian splatting has emerged and developed quickly. They learn 3D Gaussians from 2D RGB images generated from pre-trained multi-view diffusion (MVD) models, and have shown a promising avenue for 3D generation through a single image. Despite the current progress, these methods still suffer from the inconsistency jointly caused by the geometric ambiguity in the 2D images, and the lack of structure of 3D Gaussians, leading to distorted and blurry 3D object generation. In this paper, we propose to fix these issues by GS-RGBN, a new RGBN-volume Gaussian Reconstruction Model designed to generate high-fidelity 3D objects from single-view images. Our key insight is a structured 3D representation can simultaneously mitigate the afore-mentioned two issues. To this end, we propose a novel hybrid Voxel-Gaussian representation, where a 3D voxel representation contains explicit 3D geometric information, eliminating the geometric ambiguity from 2D images. It also structures Gaussians during learning so that the optimization tends to find better local optima. Our 3D voxel representation is obtained by a fusion module that aligns RGB features and surface normal features, both of which can be estimated from 2D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our methods over prior works in terms of high-quality reconstruction results, robust generalization, and good efficiency.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

Consequently, Content Removal Techniques (CRTs) have emerged as a growing area of research to control outputs without full-scale retraining. Recent work has explored the use of Machine Unlearning in generative models to address content removal. However, the focus of such research has been on diffusion models, and unlearning in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has remained largely unexplored. We address this gap by proposing Text-to-Unlearn, a novel framework that selectively unlearns concepts from pre-trained GANs using only text prompts, enabling feature unlearning, identity unlearning, and fine-grained tasks like expression and multi-attribute removal in models trained on human faces. Leveraging natural language descriptions, our approach guides the unlearning process without requiring additional datasets or supervised fine-tuning, offering a scalable and efficient solution. To evaluate its effectiveness, we introduce an automatic unlearning assessment method adapted from state-of-the-art image-text alignment metrics, providing a comprehensive analysis of the unlearning methodology. To our knowledge, Text-to-Unlearn is the first cross-modal unlearning framework for GANs, representing a flexible and efficient advancement in managing generative model behavior.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Follow the Flow: On Information Flow Across Textual Tokens in Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01137v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models often suffer from issues such as semantic leakage, incorrect feature binding, and omissions of key concepts in the generated image. This work studies these phenomena by looking into the role of information flow between textual token representations. To this end, we generate images by applying the diffusion component on a subset of contextual token representations in a given prompt and observe several interesting phenomena. First, in many cases, a word or multiword expression is fully represented by one or two tokens, while other tokens are redundant. For example, in "San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge", the token "gate" alone captures the full expression. We demonstrate the redundancy of these tokens by removing them after textual encoding and generating an image from the resulting representation. Surprisingly, we find that this process not only maintains image generation performance but also reduces errors by 21\% compared to standard generation. We then show that information can also flow between different expressions in a sentence, which often leads to semantic leakage. Based on this observation, we propose a simple, training-free method to mitigate semantic leakage: replacing the leaked item's representation after the textual encoding with its uncontextualized representation. Remarkably, this simple approach reduces semantic leakage by 85\%. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive analysis of information flow across textual tokens in T2I models, offering both novel insights and practical benefits.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a large-scale and fully end-to-end diffusion model for multi-modal understanding and generation that significantly improves on existing diffusion-based multimodal models, and is the first of its kind to support the full suite of vision-language modeling capabilities. Inspired by the multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT) and recent advances in discrete diffusion language modeling, we leverage a cross-modal maximum likelihood estimation framework that simultaneously trains the conditional likelihoods of both images and text jointly under a single loss function, which is back-propagated through both branches of the diffusion transformer. The resulting model is highly flexible and capable of a wide range of tasks including image generation, captioning, and visual question answering. Our model attained competitive performance compared to recent unified image understanding and generation models, demonstrating the potential of multimodal diffusion modeling as a promising alternative to autoregressive next-token prediction models.</p></details> |  | None |

One particularly intriguing application is transforming characters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows players to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite characters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are defined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and fixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through open-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments. Recently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs large language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into language instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical visual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only generates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an engaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state, including dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates to character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel action-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can be decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model. By taking historical animation shot representations as context and predicting subsequent representations, AnimeGamer can generate games with contextual consistency and satisfactory dynamics. Extensive evaluations using both automated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that AnimeGamer outperforms existing methods in various aspects of the gaming experience.

However, most existing methods struggle to address the trade-off in shared latent space for generation quality vs. representation learning and efficiency. To push the limits of this paradigm, we propose MergeVQ, which incorporates token merging techniques into VQ-based generative models to bridge the gap between image generation and visual representation learning in a unified architecture. During pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from latent space with the token merge module after self-attention blocks in the encoder for subsequent Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ) and global alignment and recovers their fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction. As for the second-stage generation, we introduce MergeAR, which performs KV Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify that MergeVQ as an AR generative model achieves competitive performance in both visual representation learning and image generation tasks while maintaining favorable token efficiency and inference speed.

However, despite their initial success, most latent diffusion methods rely on fixed pretrained embeddings, limiting the benefits of joint training with the diffusion model. While jointly learning the embedding (via reconstruction loss) and the latent diffusion model (via score matching loss) could enhance performance, end-to-end training risks embedding collapse, degrading generation quality. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VQ-LCMD, a continuous-space latent diffusion framework within the embedding space that stabilizes training. VQ-LCMD uses a novel training objective combining the joint embedding-diffusion variational lower bound with a consistency-matching (CM) loss, alongside a shifted cosine noise schedule and random dropping strategy. Experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed VQ-LCMD yields superior results on FFHQ, LSUN Churches, and LSUN Bedrooms compared to discrete-state latent diffusion models. In particular, VQ-LCMD achieves an FID of 6.81 for class-conditional image generation on ImageNet with 50 steps.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce Stable-Makeup, a novel diffusion-based makeup transfer method capable of robustly transferring a wide range of real-world makeup, onto user-provided faces. Stable-Makeup is based on a pre-trained diffusion model and utilizes a Detail-Preserving (D-P) makeup encoder to encode makeup details. It also employs content and structural control modules to preserve the content and structural information of the source image. With the aid of our newly added makeup cross-attention layers in U-Net, we can accurately transfer the detailed makeup to the corresponding position in the source image. After content-structure decoupling training, Stable-Makeup can maintain content and the facial structure of the source image. Moreover, our method has demonstrated strong robustness and generalizability, making it applicable to varioustasks such as cross-domain makeup transfer, makeup-guided text-to-image generation and so on. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our approach delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) results among existing makeup transfer methods and exhibits a highly promising with broad potential applications in various related fields.

A plethora of methods have been proposed focusing on improving VAEs, with the incorporation of adversarial objectives and the integration of prior learning mechanisms being prominent directions. When it comes to the former, an indicative instance is the recently introduced family of Introspective VAEs aiming at ensuring that a low likelihood is assigned to unrealistic samples. In this study, we focus on the Soft-IntroVAE (S-IntroVAE) and investigate the implication of incorporating a multimodal and learnable prior into this framework. Namely, we formulate the prior as a third player and show that when trained in cooperation with the decoder constitutes an effective way for prior learning, which shares the Nash Equilibrium with the vanilla S-IntroVAE. Furthermore, based on a modified formulation of the optimal ELBO in S-IntroVAE, we develop theoretically motivated regularizations, that is (i) adaptive variance clipping to stabilize training when learning the prior and (ii) responsibility regularization to discourage the formation of inactive prior mode. Finally, we perform a series of targeted experiments on a 2D density estimation benchmark and in an image generation setting comprised of the (F)-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrating the benefit of prior learning in S-IntroVAE in generation and representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

If only a single reference image is available, it is difficult to isolate which specific elements should be transferred. However, using multiple reference images, the proposed approach distinguishes between common and unique features by selectively incorporating them into a generated output. By operating within a partially disentangled Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) embedding space (from IP-Adapter), our method enables the flexible transfer of texture, shape, motion, style, and more abstract conceptual transformations without requiring additional training or text prompts. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a diverse range of tasks, including style transfer, form metamorphosis, and conceptual transformations, showing how subtle or abstract attributes (e.g., brushstroke style, aerodynamic lines, and dynamism) can be seamlessly combined into a new image. In a user study, participants accurately recognized which features were intended to be transferred. Its simplicity, flexibility, and high-level control make Visual Concept Blending valuable for creative fields such as art, design, and content creation, where combining specific visual qualities from multiple inspirations is crucial.</p></details> |  | None |

Here, the main bottleneck is data acquisition for training: collecting a large-scale dataset of high-quality reference garment images per human subject is quite challenging, i.e., ideally, one needs to manually gather every single garment photograph worn by each human. To address this, we propose a data generation pipeline to construct a large synthetic dataset, consisting of human and multiple-garment pairs, by introducing a model to extract any reference garment images from each human image. To ensure data quality, we also propose a filtering strategy to remove undesirable generated data based on measuring perceptual similarities between the garment presented in human image and extracted garment. Finally, by utilizing the constructed synthetic dataset, we train a diffusion model having two parallel denoising paths that use multiple garment images as conditions to generate human images while preserving their fine-grained details. We further show the wide-applicability of our framework by adapting it to different types of reference-based generation in the fashion domain, including virtual try-on, and controllable human image generation with other conditions, e.g., pose, face, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Quantization of diffusion models has been explored in recent works to reduce compute costs and memory bandwidth usage. To further improve inference time, fast convolution algorithms such as Winograd can be used for convolution layers, which account for a significant portion of computations in diffusion models. However, the significant quality loss of fully quantized Winograd using existing coarser-grained post-training quantization methods, combined with the complexity and cost of finetuning the Winograd transformation matrices for such large models to recover quality, makes them unsuitable for large-scale foundation models. Motivated by the presence of a large range of values in them, we investigate the impact of finer-grained group-wise quantization in quantizing diffusion models. While group-wise quantization can largely handle the fully quantized Winograd convolution, it struggles to deal with the large distribution imbalance in a sizable portion of the Winograd domain computation. To reduce range differences in the Winograd domain, we propose finetuning only the scale parameters of the Winograd transform matrices without using any domain-specific training data. Because our method does not depend on any training data, the generalization performance of quantized diffusion models is safely guaranteed. For text-to-image generation task, the 8-bit fully-quantized diffusion model with Winograd provides near-lossless quality (FID and CLIP scores) in comparison to the full-precision model. For image classification, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Winograd PTQ method by 1.62% and 2.56% in top-1 ImageNet accuracy on ResNet18 and ResNet-34, respectively, with Winograd F(6, 3).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite notable progress in some existing approaches, our study reveals that the scarcity of high-quality datasets remains a significant bottleneck, limiting the full potential of current methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Controllable Image Generation Pipeline for synthesizing animal pose estimation data, termed AP-CAP. Within this pipeline, we introduce a Multi-Modal Animal Image Generation Model capable of producing images with expected poses. To enhance the quality and diversity of the generated data, we further propose three innovative strategies: (1) Modality-Fusion-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to integrate multi-source appearance representations, (2) Pose-Adjustment-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to dynamically capture diverse pose variations, and (3) Caption-Enhancement-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to enrich visual semantic understanding. Leveraging the proposed model and strategies, we create the MPCH Dataset (Modality-Pose-Caption Hybrid), the first hybrid dataset that innovatively combines synthetic and real data, establishing the largest-scale multi-source heterogeneous benchmark repository for animal pose estimation to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in improving both the performance and generalization capability of animal pose estimators.</p></details> |  | None |

Often training data and AI output is biased for or against certain demographics (i.e. older white people are overrepresented in image datasets), but sometimes large AI models accurately illustrate biases in the real world (i.e. young black men being disproportionately viewed as threatening). These social disparities often appear in image generation AI outputs in the form of 'marked' features, where some feature of an individual or setting is a social marker of disparity, and prompts both humans and AI systems to treat subjects that are marked in this way as exceptional and requiring special treatment. Generative AI has proven to be very sensitive to such marked features, to the extent of over-emphasising them and thus often exacerbating social biases. I briefly discuss how we can use complex prompts to image generation AI to investigate either dimension of bias, emphasising how we can probe the large language models underlying image generation AI through, for example, automated sentiment analysis of the text prompts used to generate images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 74th Annual ICA 2024 Conference, in the stream "Image-as-Data Methods in the Age of Generative Artificial Intelligence", 22 June 2024</p></details> | None |

Established on the off-the-shelf text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, we propose a novel training-free text-guided image-to-image (I2I) translation framework dubbed as \textbf{P}hase-\textbf{T}ransferred \textbf{Diffusion} Model (PTDiffusion) for hidden art syntheses. PTDiffusion harmoniously embeds an input reference image into arbitrary scenes described by the text prompts, producing illusion images exhibiting hidden visual cues of the reference image.

Furthermore, we propose asynchronous phase transfer to enable flexible control to the degree of hidden content discernability. Our method bypasses any model training and fine-tuning process, all while substantially outperforming related text-guided I2I methods in image generation quality, text fidelity, visual discernibility, and contextual naturalness for illusion picture synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments.

While distributed approaches such as federated learning has gained traction, they remain vulnerable to privacy breaches, particularly in sensitive domains like medical imaging. Generative models, such as diffusion models, enhance privacy by synthesizing realistic data. However, they are prone to memorization, especially when trained on small datasets. This study proposes a decentralized few-shot generative model (DFGM) to synthesize brain tumor images while fully preserving privacy. DFGM harmonizes private tumor data with publicly shareable healthy images from multiple medical centers, constructing a new dataset by blending tumor foregrounds with healthy backgrounds. This approach ensures stringent privacy protection and enables controllable, high-quality synthesis by preserving both the healthy backgrounds and tumor foregrounds. We assess DFGM's effectiveness in brain tumor segmentation using a UNet, achieving Dice score improvements of 3.9% for data augmentation and 4.6% for fairness on a separate dataset.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures | None |

Yet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an end-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent system, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy. Thus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination in an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end manner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches the content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from existing agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation explicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and dynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\times$ sample efficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works. During inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential action, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance to review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions. Experimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not only improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of generalist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Sociological research has established systematic classifications of bias. Yet, existing studies on bias in T2I models largely conflate different types of bias, impeding methodological progress. In this paper, we introduce BIGbench, a unified benchmark for Biases of Image Generation, featuring a carefully designed dataset. Unlike existing benchmarks, BIGbench classifies and evaluates biases across four dimensions to enable a more granular evaluation and deeper analysis. Furthermore, BIGbench applies advanced multi-modal large language models to achieve fully automated and highly accurate evaluations. We apply BIGbench to evaluate eight representative T2I models and three debiasing methods.

| **[Style Quantization for Data-Efficient GAN Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24282v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Under limited data setting, GANs often struggle to navigate and effectively exploit the input latent space. Consequently, images generated from adjacent variables in a sparse input latent space may exhibit significant discrepancies in realism, leading to suboptimal consistency regularization (CR) outcomes. To address this, we propose \textit{SQ-GAN}, a novel approach that enhances CR by introducing a style space quantization scheme. This method transforms the sparse, continuous input latent space into a compact, structured discrete proxy space, allowing each element to correspond to a specific real data point, thereby improving CR performance. Instead of direct quantization, we first map the input latent variables into a less entangled ``style'' space and apply quantization using a learnable codebook. This enables each quantized code to control distinct factors of variation. Additionally, we optimize the optimal transport distance to align the codebook codes with features extracted from the training data by a foundation model, embedding external knowledge into the codebook and establishing a semantically rich vocabulary that properly describes the training dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both discriminator robustness and generation quality with our method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FakeScope: Large Multimodal Expert Model for Transparent AI-Generated Image Forensics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24267v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid and unrestrained advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) presents a double-edged sword: while enabling unprecedented creativity, it also facilitates the generation of highly convincing deceptive content, undermining societal trust. As image generation techniques become increasingly sophisticated, detecting synthetic images is no longer just a binary task: it necessitates interpretable, context-aware methodologies that enhance trustworthiness and transparency. However, existing detection models primarily focus on classification, offering limited explanatory insights into image authenticity. In this work, we propose FakeScope, an expert multimodal model (LMM) tailored for AI-generated image forensics, which not only identifies AI-synthetic images with high accuracy but also provides rich, interpretable, and query-driven forensic insights. We first construct FakeChain dataset that contains linguistic authenticity reasoning based on visual trace evidence, developed through a novel human-machine collaborative framework. Building upon it, we further present FakeInstruct, the largest multimodal instruction tuning dataset containing 2 million visual instructions tailored to enhance forensic awareness in LMMs. FakeScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-ended and open-ended forensic scenarios. It can distinguish synthetic images with high accuracy while offering coherent and insightful explanations, free-form discussions on fine-grained forgery attributes, and actionable enhancement strategies. Notably, despite being trained exclusively on qualitative hard labels, FakeScope demonstrates remarkable zero-shot quantitative capability on detection, enabled by our proposed token-based probability estimation strategy. Furthermore, FakeScope exhibits strong generalization and in-the-wild ability, ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce DICE (Discrete Inversion for Controllable Editing), the first approach to enable precise inversion for discrete diffusion models, including multinomial diffusion and masked generative models. By recording noise sequences and masking patterns during the reverse diffusion process, DICE enables accurate reconstruction and flexible editing of discrete data without the need for predefined masks or attention manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DICE across both image and text domains, evaluating it on models such as VQ-Diffusion, Paella, and RoBERTa. Our results show that DICE preserves high data fidelity while enhancing editing capabilities, offering new opportunities for fine-grained content manipulation in discrete spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://hexiaoxiao-cs.github.io/DICE/.

From cave paintings to photographs of mobile devices on social media, humans always had the urge to capture particularly important events during a war. Images provide visual evidence. For armed forces, they may serve as the output of a sensor (e.g. in aerial reconnaissance) or as an effector on cognition (e.g. in form of photographic propaganda). They can inform, influence, or even manipulate a target audience. The recent advancements in the field of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to synthesize photorealistic images give rise to several new challenges for armed forces. The objective of this report is to investigate the role of AI-generated images for armed forces and provide an overview on opportunities and threats. When compared with traditional image generation (e.g. photography), generative AI brings distinct conceptual advantages to implement new tactical tenets and concepts which so far have not been feasible: masses of AI-generated images can be used for deceptive purposes, to influence the pace of combat in the information environment, to cause surprise, sow confusion and shock. AI-generated images are a tool favoured for offensive manoeuvres in the information environment. To prepare for future challenges involving AI-generated images and improve their resilience, recommendations are given at the end of the report for all branches of the armed forces, who are active in cyber defense and/or exposed to the information environment.</p></details> | 37 pages, 8 figures | None |

However, deployment remains a critical challenge due to complex environment configurations, dependency conflicts, cross-platform adaptation, and debugging difficulties, which hinder automation and adoption. This paper introduces AI2Agent, an end-to-end framework that automates AI project deployment through guideline-driven execution, self-adaptive debugging, and case \& solution accumulation. AI2Agent dynamically analyzes deployment challenges, learns from past cases, and iteratively refines its approach, significantly reducing human intervention. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments on 30 AI deployment cases, covering TTS, text-to-image generation, image editing, and other AI applications. Results show that AI2Agent significantly reduces deployment time and improves success rates. The code and demo video are now publicly accessible.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Know "No'' Better: A Data-Driven Approach for Enhancing Negation Awareness in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10913v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While CLIP has significantly advanced multimodal understanding by bridging vision and language, the inability to grasp negation - such as failing to differentiate concepts like "parking" from "no parking" - poses substantial challenges. By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the significant advancements in customized generation methods, particularly with the success of diffusion models, existing methods often struggle with multi-concept scenarios due to low concept fidelity and high inference cost. MultiBooth addresses these issues by dividing the multi-concept generation process into two phases: a single-concept learning phase and a multi-concept integration phase. During the single-concept learning phase, we employ a multi-modal image encoder and an efficient concept encoding technique to learn a concise and discriminative representation for each concept. In the multi-concept integration phase, we use bounding boxes to define the generation area for each concept within the cross-attention map. This method enables the creation of individual concepts within their specified regions, thereby facilitating the formation of multi-concept images. This strategy not only improves concept fidelity but also reduces additional inference cost. MultiBooth surpasses various baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showcasing its superior performance and computational efficiency.

| **[Enhancing Intent Understanding for Ambiguous prompt: A Human-Machine Co-Adaption Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15167v4)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's image generation systems are capable of producing realistic and high-quality images. However, user prompts often contain ambiguities, making it difficult for these systems to interpret users' actual intentions. Consequently, many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in our proposed dataset. Our annotation tools and several examples of our dataset are available at https://zenodo.org/records/14876029 for easier review.

| **[Boost Your Human Image Generation Model via Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20216v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human image generation is a key focus in image synthesis due to its broad applications, but even slight inaccuracies in anatomy, pose, or details can compromise realism. To address these challenges, we explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which trains models to generate preferred (winning) images while diverging from non-preferred (losing) ones. However, conventional DPO methods use generated images as winning images, limiting realism. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced DPO approach that incorporates high-quality real images as winning images, encouraging outputs to resemble real images rather than generated ones. However, implementing this concept is not a trivial task. Therefore, our approach, HG-DPO (Human image Generation through DPO), employs a novel curriculum learning framework that gradually improves the output of the model toward greater realism, making training more feasible. Furthermore, HG-DPO effectively adapts to personalized text-to-image tasks, generating high-quality and identity-specific images, which highlights the practical value of our approach.</p></details> | CVPR`2025 | None |
| **[Enhancing Object Coherence in Layout-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10522v7)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Layout-to-image synthesis is an emerging technique in conditional image generation. It aims to generate complex scenes, where users require fine control over the layout of the objects in a scene. However, it remains challenging to control the object coherence, including semantic coherence (e.g., the cat looks at the flowers or not) and physical coherence (e.g., the hand and the racket should not be misaligned). In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and self-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for this task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains rich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in the images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and latent images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement separately and thus leads to unsatisfying results shown in our experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from the layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to guide the image synthesis process. Moreover, to improve the physical coherence, we develop a Self-similarity Coherence Attention (SCA) module to explicitly integrate local contextual physical coherence relation into each pixel's generation process. Specifically, we adopt a self-similarity map to encode the physical coherence restrictions and employ it to extract coherent features from text embedding. Through visualization of our self-similarity map, we explore the essence of SCA, revealing that its effectiveness is not only in capturing reliable physical coherence patterns but also in enhancing complex texture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/CodeGoat24/EOCNet</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/CodeGoat24/EOCNet) |

Notably, generative AI's capacity for generating images of copyrighted characters has been well documented in the literature, and while various techniques for mitigating copyright issues have been studied, significant risks remain. Here, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a generative model to make them more generic and less likely to imitate distinctive features of copyrighted materials. To achieve this, we introduce a metric for quantifying the level of originality of data, estimated by drawing samples from a generative model, and applied in the genericization process. As a practical implementation, we introduce PREGen (Prompt Rewriting-Enhanced Genericization), which combines our genericization method with an existing mitigation technique. Compared to the existing method, PREGen reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted characters by more than half when the names of copyrighted characters are used as the prompt. Additionally, while generative models can produce copyrighted characters even when their names are not directly mentioned in the prompt, PREGen almost entirely prevents the generation of such characters in these cases. Ultimately, this study advances computational approaches for quantifying and strengthening copyright protection, thereby providing practical methodologies to promote responsible generative AI development.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures | None |

These high-resolution, language-guided synthesized images are essential for the explainability of disease or exploring causal relationships. However, their potential for disentangling and controlling latent factors of variation in specialized domains like medical imaging remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first investigation of the power of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, once fine-tuned on medical image datasets, to perform latent disentanglement for factorized medical image generation and interpolation. Through extensive experiments on chest X-ray and skin datasets, we illustrate that fine-tuned, language-guided Stable Diffusion inherently learns to factorize key attributes for image generation, such as the patient's anatomical structures or disease diagnostic features. We devise a framework to identify, isolate, and manipulate key attributes through latent space trajectory traversal of generative models, facilitating precise control over medical image synthesis.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

Such success inspires many efforts trying to use large-scale pre-trained diffusion models for tackling a challenging problem--real image editing. Works conducted in this area learn a unique textual token corresponding to several images containing the same object. However, under many circumstances, only one image is available, such as the painting of the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Using existing works on fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models with a single image causes severe overfitting issues. The information leakage from the pre-trained diffusion models makes editing can not keep the same content as the given image while creating new features depicted by the language guidance. This work aims to address the problem of single-image editing. We propose a novel model-based guidance built upon the classifier-free guidance so that the knowledge from the model trained on a single image can be distilled into the pre-trained diffusion model, enabling content creation even with one given image. Additionally, we propose a patch-based fine-tuning that can effectively help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution. We provide extensive experiments to validate the design choices of our approach and show promising editing capabilities, including changing style, content addition, and object manipulation.

In this work, we are the first to investigate the question: 'Can fine-tuned foundation models help identify critical, and possibly unknown, data properties?' By evaluating our proposed method on a chest x-ray dataset, we show that these models can generate high-resolution, precisely edited images compared to methods that rely on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) according to numerous metrics. For the first time, we demonstrate that fine-tuned VLMs can reveal hidden data relationships that were previously obscured due to available metadata granularity and model capacity limitations. Our experiments demonstrate both the potential of these models to reveal underlying dataset properties while also exposing the limitations of fine-tuned VLMs for accurate image editing and susceptibility to biases and spurious correlations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation-especially the success of visual autoregressive methods-we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Extensive experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrate that MAG delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to three orders of magnitude in speedup during inference.</p></details> | Draft #1 | None |

The recent development of diffusion transformer (DiT) has witnessed overwhelming performance over the traditional UNet-based architecture in image generation, which also raises the question: Can we adopt the advanced DiT-based diffusion model for Real-ISR? To this end, we propose our DiT4SR, one of the pioneering works to tame the large-scale DiT model for Real-ISR. Instead of directly injecting embeddings extracted from low-resolution (LR) images like ControlNet, we integrate the LR embeddings into the original attention mechanism of DiT, allowing for the bidirectional flow of information between the LR latent and the generated latent. The sufficient interaction of these two streams allows the LR stream to evolve with the diffusion process, producing progressively refined guidance that better aligns with the generated latent at each diffusion step. Additionally, the LR guidance is injected into the generated latent via a cross-stream convolution layer, compensating for DiT's limited ability to capture local information. These simple but effective designs endow the DiT model with superior performance in Real-ISR, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments.

However, their creative capability remains constrained, as including `creative' in prompts seldom yields the desired results. This paper introduces C3 (Creative Concept Catalyst), a training-free approach designed to enhance creativity in Stable Diffusion-based models. C3 selectively amplifies features during the denoising process to foster more creative outputs. We offer practical guidelines for choosing amplification factors based on two main aspects of creativity. C3 is the first study to enhance creativity in diffusion models without extensive computational costs. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various Stable Diffusion-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 accepted paper</p></details> | None |

The twofold demand of concept erasure includes not only a precise removal of the target concept (i.e., erasure efficacy) but also a minimal change on non-target content (i.e., prior preservation), during generation. Existing methods face challenges in maintaining an effective balance between erasure efficacy and prior preservation, and they can be computationally costly. To improve, we propose a precise, fast, and low-cost concept erasure method, called Adaptive Value Decomposer (AdaVD), which is training-free. Our method is grounded in a classical linear algebraic operation of computing the orthogonal complement, implemented in the value space of each cross-attention layer within the UNet of diffusion models. We design a shift factor to adaptively navigate the erasure strength, enhancing effective prior preservation without sacrificing erasure efficacy. Extensive comparative experiments with both training-based and training-free state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that the proposed AdaVD excels in both single and multiple concept erasure, showing 2 to 10 times improvement in prior preservation than the second best, meanwhile achieving the best or near best erasure efficacy. AdaVD supports a series of diffusion models and downstream image generation tasks, with code available on: https://github.com/WYuan1001/AdaVD.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/WYuan1001/AdaVD) |

This paper presents the first large-scale study on gender bias in text-to-image (T2I) models, focusing on everyday situations. While previous research has examined biases in occupations, we extend this analysis to gender associations in daily activities, objects, and contexts. We create a dataset of 3,217 gender-neutral prompts and generate 200 images per prompt from five leading T2I models. We automatically detect the perceived gender of people in the generated images and filter out images with no person or multiple people of different genders, leaving 2,293,295 images. To enable a broad analysis of gender bias in T2I models, we group prompts into semantically similar concepts and calculate the proportion of male- and female-gendered images for each prompt. Our analysis shows that T2I models reinforce traditional gender roles, reflect common gender stereotypes in household roles, and underrepresent women in financial related activities. Women are predominantly portrayed in care- and human-centered scenarios, and men in technical or physical labor scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

State-of-the-art methods alleviate such overhead in parallel diffusion inference through computation-communication overlapping, termed displaced parallelism. However, we identify that these techniques induce severe *staleness*-the usage of outdated activations from previous timesteps that significantly degrades quality, especially in expert-parallel scenarios. We tackle this fundamental tension and propose DICE, a staleness-centric optimization framework with a three-fold approach: (1) Interweaved Parallelism introduces staggered pipelines, effectively halving step-level staleness for free; (2) Selective Synchronization operates at layer-level and protects layers vulnerable from staled activations; and (3) Conditional Communication, a token-level, training-free method that dynamically adjusts communication frequency based on token importance. Together, these strategies effectively reduce staleness, achieving 1.26x speedup with minimal quality degradation. Empirical results establish DICE as an effective and scalable solution.

Unlike previous diffusion-based models that treat layout planning and layout-to-image as two separate models, PlanGen jointly models the two tasks into one autoregressive transformer using only next-token prediction. PlanGen integrates layout conditions into the model as context without requiring specialized encoding of local captions and bounding box coordinates, which provides significant advantages over the previous embed-and-pool operations on layout conditions, particularly when dealing with complex layouts. Unified prompting allows PlanGen to perform multitasking training related to layout, including layout planning, layout-to-image generation, image layout understanding, etc. In addition, PlanGen can be seamlessly expanded to layout-guided image manipulation thanks to the well-designed modeling, with teacher-forcing content manipulation policy and negative layout guidance. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our PlanGen in multiple layoutrelated tasks, showing its great potential.

However, insufficient oversight in artificial Intelligence generated content (AIGC) can facilitate the spread of malicious content and increase the risk of copyright infringement. Among the diverse range of image generation models, the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) is currently the most widely used, dominating the majority of the Text-to-Image model market. Currently, most attribution methods for LDMs rely on directly embedding watermarks into the generated images or their intermediate noise, a practice that compromises both the quality and the robustness of the generated content. To address these limitations, we introduce TraceMark-LDM, an novel algorithm that integrates watermarking to attribute generated images while guaranteeing non-destructive performance. Unlike current methods, TraceMark-LDM leverages watermarks as guidance to rearrange random variables sampled from a Gaussian distribution. To mitigate potential deviations caused by inversion errors, the small absolute elements are grouped and rearranged. Additionally, we fine-tune the LDM encoder to enhance the robustness of the watermark. Experimental results show that images synthesized using TraceMark-LDM exhibit superior quality and attribution accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. Notably, TraceMark-LDM demonstrates exceptional robustness against various common attack methods, consistently outperforming SOTA methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures, | None |
| **[An End-to-End Model for Photo-Sharing Multi-modal Dialogue Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08650v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo-Sharing Multi-modal dialogue generation requires a dialogue agent not only to generate text responses but also to share photos at the proper moment. Using image text caption as the bridge, a pipeline model integrates an image caption model, a text generation model, and an image generation model to handle this complex multi-modal task. However, representing the images with text captions may loss important visual details and information and cause error propagation in the complex dialogue system. Besides, the pipeline model isolates the three models separately because discrete image text captions hinder end-to-end gradient propagation. We propose the first end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation, which integrates an image perceptron and an image generator with a large language model. The large language model employs the Q-Former to perceive visual images in the input end. For image generation in the output end, we propose a dynamic vocabulary transformation matrix and use straight-through and gumbel-softmax techniques to align the large language model and stable diffusion model and achieve end-to-end gradient propagation. We perform experiments on PhotoChat and DialogCC datasets to evaluate our end-to-end model. Compared with pipeline models, the end-to-end model gains state-of-the-art performances on various metrics of text and image generation. More analysis experiments also verify the effectiveness of the end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 | None |

Popular training enrichment approaches like model enlargement or massive data gathering are expensive and environmentally unsustainable, thus we seek to provide better visual explanations to RS aligning with the principles of Responsible AI. In this work, we research the intersection of effective and sustainable training enrichment strategies for visual-based RS explainability models by developing three novel strategies that focus on training Data Quality: 1) selection of reliable negative training examples using Positive-unlabelled Learning, 2) transform-based data augmentation, and 3) text-to-image generative-based data augmentation. The integration of these strategies in three state-of-the-art explainability models increases 5% the performance in relevant ranking metrics of these visual-based RS explainability models without penalizing their practical long-term sustainability, as tested in multiple real-world restaurant recommendation explanation datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Vision-Language Compositional Understanding with Multimodal Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01167v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paired image-text data with subtle variations in-between (e.g., people holding surfboards vs. people holding shovels) hold the promise of producing Vision-Language Models with proper compositional understanding. Synthesizing such training data from generative models is a highly coveted prize due to the reduced cost of data collection. However, synthesizing training images for compositional learning presents three challenges: (1) efficiency in generating large quantities of images, (2) text alignment between the generated image and the caption in the exact place of the subtle change, and (3) image fidelity in ensuring sufficient similarity with the original real images in all other places. We propose SPARCL (Synthetic Perturbations for Advancing Robust Compositional Learning), which integrates image feature injection into a fast text-to-image generative model, followed by an image style transfer step, to meet the three challenges. Further, to cope with any residual issues of text alignment, we propose an adaptive margin loss to filter out potentially incorrect synthetic samples and focus the learning on informative hard samples. Evaluation on four compositional understanding benchmarks demonstrates that SPARCL significantly improves the compositionality of CLIP, boosting the average accuracy of the CLIP base model by over 8% across all benchmarks and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2% on three benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On Geometrical Properties of Text Token Embeddings for Strong Semantic Binding in Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23011v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models often suffer from text-image misalignment in complex scenes involving multiple objects and attributes. Semantic binding aims to mitigate this issue by accurately associating the generated attributes and objects with their corresponding noun phrases (NPs). Existing methods rely on text or latent optimizations, yet the factors influencing semantic binding remain underexplored. Here we investigate the geometrical properties of text token embeddings and their cross-attention (CA) maps. We empirically and theoretically analyze that the geometrical properties of token embeddings, specifically both angular distances and norms, play a crucial role in CA map differentiation. Then, we propose \textbf{TeeMo}, a training-free text embedding-aware T2I framework with strong semantic binding. TeeMo consists of Causality-Aware Projection-Out (CAPO) for distinct inter-NP CA maps and Adaptive Token Mixing (ATM) with our loss to enhance inter-NP separation while maintaining intra-NP cohesion in CA maps. Extensive experiments confirm TeeMo consistently outperforms prior arts across diverse baselines and datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Post-Training Quantization for Diffusion Transformer via Hierarchical Timestep Grouping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06930v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has now become the preferred choice for building image generation models due to its great generation capability. Unlike previous convolution-based UNet models, DiT is purely composed of a stack of transformer blocks, which renders DiT excellent in scalability like large language models. However, the growing model size and multi-step sampling paradigm bring about considerable pressure on deployment and inference. In this work, we propose a post-training quantization framework tailored for Diffusion Transforms to tackle these challenges. We firstly locate that the quantization difficulty of DiT mainly originates from the time-dependent channel-specific outliers. We propose a timestep-aware shift-and-scale strategy to smooth the activation distribution to reduce the quantization error. Secondly, based on the observation that activations of adjacent timesteps have similar distributions, we utilize a hierarchical clustering scheme to divide the denoising timesteps into multiple groups. We further design a re-parameterization scheme which absorbs the quantization parameters into nearby module to avoid redundant computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that out PTQ method successfully quantize the Diffusion Transformer into 8-bit weight and 8-bit activation (W8A8) with state-of-the-art FiD score. And our method can further quantize DiT model into 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation (W4A8) without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fast Direct: Query-Efficient Online Black-box Guidance for Diffusion-model Target Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01692v5)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion model to address specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively.

In this work, we propose SCoPE (Scheduled interpolation of Coarse-to-fine Prompt Embeddings), a training-free method to improve text-to-image alignment by progressively refining the input prompt in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner. Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image. Our training-free plug-and-play approach significantly enhances prompt alignment, achieves an average improvement of up to +4% in Visual Question Answering (VQA) scores over the Stable Diffusion baselines on 85% of the prompts from the GenAI-Bench dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models often face significant computational bottlenecks, particularly in attention mechanisms, which hinder their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DiTFastAttnV2, a post-training compression method designed to accelerate attention in MMDiT. Through an in-depth analysis of MMDiT's attention patterns, we identify key differences from prior DiT-based methods and propose head-wise arrow attention and caching mechanisms to dynamically adjust attention heads, effectively bridging this gap. We also design an Efficient Fused Kernel for further acceleration. By leveraging local metric methods and optimization techniques, our approach significantly reduces the search time for optimal compression schemes to just minutes while maintaining generation quality. Furthermore, with the customized kernel, DiTFastAttnV2 achieves a 68% reduction in attention FLOPs and 1.5x end-to-end speedup on 2K image generation without compromising visual fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

It is generally difficult to quantitatively and authoritatively evaluate the quality of synthetic images; however, in mission-critical biomedical scenarios robust evaluation is paramount. In this work, all practical image-to-image comparisons really are relative qualifications, not absolute difference quantifications; and, therefore, meaningful evaluation of generated image quality can be accomplished using the Tversky Index, which is a well-established measure for assessing perceptual similarity. This evaluation procedure is developed and then demonstrated using multiple image data sets, both real and simulated. The main result is that when the subjectivity and intrinsic deficiencies of any feature-encoding choice are put upfront, Tversky's method leads to intuitive results, whereas traditional methods based on summarizing distances in deep feature spaces do not.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages.

| **[Patronus: Bringing Transparency to Diffusion Models with Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22782v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), have achieved remarkable success in image generation, but their step-by-step denoising process remains opaque, leaving critical aspects of the generation mechanism unexplained. To address this, we introduce \emph{Patronus}, an interpretable diffusion model inspired by ProtoPNet. Patronus integrates a prototypical network into DDPMs, enabling the extraction of prototypes and conditioning of the generation process on their prototype activation vector. This design enhances interpretability by showing the learned prototypes and how they influence the generation process. Additionally, the model supports downstream tasks like image manipulation, enabling more transparent and controlled modifications. Moreover, Patronus could reveal shortcut learning in the generation process by detecting unwanted correlations between learned prototypes. Notably, Patronus operates entirely without any annotations or text prompts. This work opens new avenues for understanding and controlling diffusion models through prototype-based interpretability.

| **[TULIP: Token-length Upgraded CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10034v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of representing long captions in vision-language models, such as CLIP. By design these models are limited by fixed, absolute positional encodings, restricting inputs to a maximum of 77 tokens and hindering performance on tasks requiring longer descriptions. Although recent work has attempted to overcome this limit, their proposed approaches struggle to model token relationships over longer distances and simply extend to a fixed new token length. Instead, we propose a generalizable method, named TULIP, able to upgrade the token length to any length for CLIP-like models. We do so by improving the architecture with relative position encodings, followed by a training procedure that (i) distills the original CLIP text encoder into an encoder with relative position encodings and (ii) enhances the model for aligning longer captions with images. By effectively encoding captions longer than the default 77 tokens, our model outperforms baselines on cross-modal tasks such as retrieval and text-to-image generation.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant risks to patient safety. Current attack methodologies use general techniques such as model querying or pixel value perturbations to generate adversarial examples designed to fool a model. These approaches may not adequately address the unique characteristics of clinical errors stemming from missed or incorrectly identified clinical features. We propose the Concept-based Report Perturbation Attack (CoRPA), a clinically-focused black-box adversarial attack framework tailored to the medical imaging domain. CoRPA leverages clinical concepts to generate adversarial radiological reports and images that closely mirror realistic clinical misdiagnosis scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of CoRPA using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset of chest X-rays and radiological reports. Our evaluation reveals that deep learning models exhibiting strong resilience to conventional adversarial attacks are significantly less robust when subjected to CoRPA's clinically-focused perturbations. This underscores the importance of addressing domain-specific vulnerabilities in medical AI systems. By introducing a specialized adversarial attack framework, this study provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world-ready AI models in healthcare, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving identity personalization-ensuring that a model consistently generates subject-specific outputs from limited reference images-remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we introduce Meta-Low-Rank Adaptation (Meta-LoRA), a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to encode domain-specific priors into LoRA-based identity personalization. Our method introduces a structured three-layer LoRA architecture that separates identity-agnostic knowledge from identity-specific adaptation. In the first stage, the LoRA Meta-Down layers are meta-trained across multiple subjects, learning a shared manifold that captures general identity-related features. In the second stage, only the LoRA-Mid and LoRA-Up layers are optimized to specialize on a given subject, significantly reducing adaptation time while improving identity fidelity. To evaluate our approach, we introduce Meta-PHD, a new benchmark dataset for identity personalization, and compare Meta-LoRA against state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that Meta-LoRA achieves superior identity retention, computational efficiency, and adaptability across diverse identity conditions. The code, model weights, and dataset will be released publicly upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

This approach typically uses a photometric consistency loss between a synthesized image, generated from the estimated depth, and the original image, thereby reducing the need for extensive dataset acquisition. However, the conventional photometric consistency loss relies on the Lambertian assumption, which often leads to significant errors when dealing with reflective surfaces that deviate from this model. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates intrinsic image decomposition into SSMDE. Our method synergistically trains for both monocular depth estimation and intrinsic image decomposition. The accurate depth estimation facilitates multi-image consistency for intrinsic image decomposition by aligning different view coordinate systems, while the decomposition process identifies reflective areas and excludes corrupted gradients from the depth training process. Furthermore, our framework introduces a pseudo-depth generation and knowledge distillation technique to further enhance the performance of the student model across both reflective and non-reflective surfaces. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing SSMDE baselines in depth prediction, especially on reflective surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

While previous work on spatial grounding in image generation has mainly focused on 2D positioning, it lacks control over 3D orientation. To address this, we propose a reward-guided sampling approach using a pretrained discriminative model for 3D orientation estimation and a one-step text-to-image generative flow model. While gradient-ascent-based optimization is a natural choice for reward-based guidance, it struggles to maintain image realism. Instead, we adopt a sampling-based approach using Langevin dynamics, which extends gradient ascent by simply injecting random noise--requiring just a single additional line of code. Additionally, we introduce adaptive time rescaling based on the reward function to accelerate convergence. Our experiments show that ORIGEN outperforms both training-based and test-time guidance methods across quantitative metrics and user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://origen2025.github.io</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces a novel system deployed at Alibaba that leverages AI-generated items (AIGI) to address these challenges with personalized text-to-image generation for e-commercial product design. AIGI enables an innovative business mode called "sell it before you make it", where merchants can design fashion items and generate photorealistic images with digital models based on textual descriptions. Only when the items have received a certain number of orders, do the merchants start to produce them, which largely reduces reliance on physical prototypes and thus accelerates time to market. For such a promising application, we identify the underlying key scientific challenge, i.e., capturing the users' group-level personalized preferences towards multiple generated candidate images. To this end, we propose a Personalized Group-Level Preference Alignment Framework for Diffusion Models (i.e., PerFusion). We first design PerFusion Reward Model for user preference estimation with a feature-crossing-based personalized plug-in. Then we develop PerFusion with a personalized adaptive network to model diverse preferences across users, and meanwhile derive the group-level preference optimization objective to capture the comparative behaviors among multiple candidates. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The AI-generated items have achieved over 13% relative improvements for both click-through rate and conversion rate compared to their human-designed counterparts, validating the revolutionary potential of AI-generated items for e-commercial platforms.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

Mainstream research paradigm necessitates real-world person images with manual textual annotations for training models, posing privacy-sensitive and labor-intensive issues. Several pioneering efforts explore synthetic data for TBPR but still rely on real data, keeping the aforementioned issues and also resulting in diversity-deficient issue in synthetic datasets, thus impacting TBPR performance. Moreover, these works tend to explore synthetic data for TBPR through limited perspectives, leading to exploration-restricted issue. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to explore the potential of synthetic data for TBPR, highlighting three key aspects. (1) We propose an inter-class image generation pipeline, in which an automatic prompt construction strategy is introduced to guide generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in generating various inter-class images without reliance on original data. (2) We develop an intra-class image augmentation pipeline, in which the generative AI models are applied to further edit the images for obtaining various intra-class images. (3) Building upon the proposed pipelines and an automatic text generation pipeline, we explore the effectiveness of synthetic data in diverse scenarios through extensive experiments. Additionally, we experimentally investigate various noise-robust learning strategies to mitigate the inherent noise in synthetic data. We will release the code, along with the synthetic large-scale dataset generated by our pipelines, which are expected to advance practical TBPR research.</p></details> | 20 pages,13 figures | None |

However, while the existing methods have been continuously focusing on several challenges, such as "missing objects" and "mismatched attributes," another critical issue of "mislocated objects" remains where generated spatial positions fail to align with text prompts. Surprisingly, ensuring such seemingly basic functionality remains challenging in popular T2I models due to the inherent difficulty of imposing explicit spatial guidance via text forms. To address this, we propose STORM (Spatial Transport Optimization by Repositioning Attention Map), a novel training-free approach for spatially coherent T2I synthesis. STORM employs Spatial Transport Optimization (STO), rooted in optimal transport theory, to dynamically adjust object attention maps for precise spatial adherence, supported by a Spatial Transport (ST) Cost function that enhances spatial understanding. Our analysis shows that integrating spatial awareness is most effective in the early denoising stages, while later phases refine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STORM surpasses existing methods, effectively mitigating mislocated objects while improving missing and mismatched attributes, setting a new benchmark for spatial alignment in T2I synthesis.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |

The core advancements include: (1) Aesthetic-4K Benchmark: addressing the absence of a publicly available 4K image synthesis dataset, we construct Aesthetic-4K, a comprehensive benchmark for ultra-high-resolution image generation. We curated a high-quality 4K dataset with carefully selected images and captions generated by GPT-4o.

Existing approaches, such as the integration of hint condition diagrams via auxiliary networks (e.g., ControlNet), have made strides towards addressing this issue. However, diffusion models often fall short in tasks requiring controlled text generation, such as specifying particular fonts or producing text in small fonts. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for multilingual visual text creation, named JoyType, designed to maintain the font style of text during the image generation process. Our methodology begins with assembling a training dataset, JoyType-1M, comprising 1 million pairs of data. Each pair includes an image, its description, and glyph instructions corresponding to the font style within the image. We then developed a text control network, Font ControlNet, tasked with extracting font style information to steer the image generation. To further enhance our model's ability to maintain font style, notably in generating small-font text, we incorporated a multi-layer OCR-aware loss into the diffusion process. This enhancement allows JoyType to direct text rendering using low-level descriptors. Our evaluations, based on both visual and accuracy metrics, demonstrate that JoyType significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, JoyType can function as a plugin, facilitating the creation of varied image styles in conjunction with other stable diffusion models on HuggingFace and CivitAI.

The segmentation of landmark structures in mammography images can aid the medical assessment in the evaluation of cancer risk and the image acquisition adequacy. We introduce a series of data-centric strategies aimed at enriching the training data for deep learning-based segmentation of landmark structures. Our approach involves augmenting the training samples through annotation-guided image intensity manipulation and style transfer to achieve better generalization than standard training procedures. These augmentations are applied in a balanced manner to ensure the model learns to process a diverse range of images generated by different vendor equipments while retaining its efficacy on the original data. We present extensive numerical and visual results that demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our methods when compared to the standard training. For this evaluation, we consider a large dataset that includes mammography images generated by different vendor equipments. Further, we present complementary results that show both the strengths and limitations of our methods across various scenarios. The accuracy and robustness demonstrated in the experiments suggest that our method is well-suited for integration into clinical practice.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Harmonizing Visual Representations for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21979v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying visual understanding and generation within a single multimodal framework remains a significant challenge, as the two inherently heterogeneous tasks require representations at different levels of granularity. Current approaches that utilize vector quantization (VQ) or variational autoencoders (VAE) for unified visual representation prioritize intrinsic imagery features over semantics, compromising understanding performance. In this work, we take inspiration from masked image modelling (MIM) that learns rich semantics via a mask-and-reconstruct pre-training and its successful extension to masked autoregressive (MAR) image generation. A preliminary study on the MAR encoder's representation reveals exceptional linear probing accuracy and precise feature response to visual concepts, which indicates MAR's potential for visual understanding tasks beyond its original generation role. Based on these insights, we present \emph{Harmon}, a unified autoregressive framework that harmonizes understanding and generation tasks with a shared MAR encoder. Through a three-stage training procedure that progressively optimizes understanding and generation capabilities, Harmon achieves state-of-the-art image generation results on the GenEval, MJHQ30K and WISE benchmarks while matching the performance of methods with dedicated semantic encoders (e.g., Janus) on image understanding benchmarks.

Unlike prior work that requires complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, <HYBNEXT>. This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm. Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility. When training from text-generation-only LLMs or random initialization, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet), and 7.5% (ImageNet) for advanced autoregressive LLMs like Chameleon and LlamaGen, all without framework modifications. For domain adaption, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). By demonstrating that training objective redesign -- not just architectural innovation -- can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges, ARRA offers a complementary paradigm for advancing autoregressive models. Code and models will be released to advance autoregressive image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accelerate High-Quality Diffusion Models with Inner Loop Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13107v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), a novel approach to accelerate diffusion models' inference. ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future features in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen diffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key intuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are similar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower burden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly flexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block from the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the diffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero initialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike some prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our model freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many efforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image quality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best case results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing runtime.

| **[Optimal Stepsize for Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21774v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models achieve remarkable generation quality but suffer from computational intensive sampling due to suboptimal step discretization. While existing works focus on optimizing denoising directions, we address the principled design of stepsize schedules. This paper proposes Optimal Stepsize Distillation, a dynamic programming framework that extracts theoretically optimal schedules by distilling knowledge from reference trajectories. By reformulating stepsize optimization as recursive error minimization, our method guarantees global discretization bounds through optimal substructure exploitation. Crucially, the distilled schedules demonstrate strong robustness across architectures, ODE solvers, and noise schedules. Experiments show 10x accelerated text-to-image generation while preserving 99.4% performance on GenEval.

Lumina-Image 2.0 is built upon two key principles: (1) Unification - it adopts a unified architecture (Unified Next-DiT) that treats text and image tokens as a joint sequence, enabling natural cross-modal interactions and allowing seamless task expansion. Besides, since high-quality captioners can provide semantically well-aligned text-image training pairs, we introduce a unified captioning system, Unified Captioner (UniCap), specifically designed for T2I generation tasks. UniCap excels at generating comprehensive and accurate captions, accelerating convergence and enhancing prompt adherence. (2) Efficiency - to improve the efficiency of our proposed model, we develop multi-stage progressive training strategies and introduce inference acceleration techniques without compromising image quality. Extensive evaluations on academic benchmarks and public text-to-image arenas show that Lumina-Image 2.0 delivers strong performances even with only 2.6B parameters, highlighting its scalability and design efficiency.

The application areas of the bridge problem are enormous, among which the recent generative modeling (e.g., conditional or unconditional image generation) is the most popular. Also the famous Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem, a widely known problem for a century, is a special instance of the bridge problem. Two most popular algorithms to tackle the bridge problems in the deep learning era are: (conditional) flow matching and iterative fitting algorithms, where the former confined to ODE solutions, and the latter specifically for the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem. The main contribution of this article is in two folds: i) We provide concise reviews of these algorithms with technical details to some extent; ii) We propose a novel unified perspective and framework that subsumes these seemingly unrelated algorithms (and their variants) into one. In particular, we show that our unified framework can instantiate the Flow Matching (FM) algorithm, the (mini-batch) optimal transport FM algorithm, the (mini-batch) Schr\"{o}dinger bridge FM algorithm, and the deep Schr\"{o}dinger bridge matching (DSBM) algorithm as its special cases. We believe that this unified framework will be useful for viewing the bridge problems in a more general and flexible perspective, and in turn can help researchers and practitioners to develop new bridge algorithms in their fields.</p></details> |  | None |

Current state-of-the-art object-centric models have shown remarkable success in object discovery in diverse domains, including complex real-world scenes. However, these models suffer from a key limitation: they lack controllability. Specifically, current object-centric models learn representations based on their preconceived understanding of objects, without allowing user input to guide which objects are represented. Introducing controllability into object-centric models could unlock a range of useful capabilities, such as the ability to extract instance-specific representations from a scene. In this work, we propose a novel approach for user-directed control over slot representations by conditioning slots on language descriptions. The proposed ConTRoLlable Object-centric representation learning approach, which we term CTRL-O, achieves targeted object-language binding in complex real-world scenes without requiring mask supervision. Next, we apply these controllable slot representations on two downstream vision language tasks: text-to-image generation and visual question answering. The proposed approach enables instance-specific text-to-image generation and also achieves strong performance on visual question answering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

How to keep automatic evaluation equitably aligned with human perception has become a well-recognized challenge. Recent advances in the field of language and image generation have explored human preferences and showcased respectable fitting ability. However, the 3D domain still lacks such a comprehensive preference dataset over generative models. To mitigate this absence, we develop 3DGen-Arena, an integrated platform in a battle manner. Then, we carefully design diverse text and image prompts and leverage the arena platform to gather human preferences from both public users and expert annotators, resulting in a large-scale multi-dimension human preference dataset 3DGen-Bench. Using this dataset, we further train a CLIP-based scoring model, 3DGen-Score, and a MLLM-based automatic evaluator, 3DGen-Eval. These two models innovatively unify the quality evaluation of text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation, and jointly form our automated evaluation system with their respective strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our scoring model in predicting human preferences, exhibiting a superior correlation with human ranks compared to existing metrics. We believe that our 3DGen-Bench dataset and automated evaluation system will foster a more equitable evaluation in the field of 3D generation, further promoting the development of 3D generative models and their downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Layer- and Timestep-Adaptive Differentiable Token Compression Ratios for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16822v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) image generation quality but suffer from high latency and memory inefficiency, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. One major efficiency bottleneck is that existing DiTs apply equal computation across all regions of an image. However, not all image tokens are equally important, and certain localized areas require more computation, such as objects. To address this, we propose DiffCR, a dynamic DiT inference framework with differentiable compression ratios, which automatically learns to dynamically route computation across layers and timesteps for each image token, resulting in efficient DiTs. Specifically, DiffCR integrates three features: (1) A token-level routing scheme where each DiT layer includes a router that is fine-tuned jointly with model weights to predict token importance scores. In this way, unimportant tokens bypass the entire layer's computation; (2) A layer-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where different DiT layers automatically learn varying compression ratios from a zero initialization, resulting in large compression ratios in redundant layers while others remain less compressed or even uncompressed; (3) A timestep-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where each denoising timestep learns its own compression ratio. The resulting pattern shows higher ratios for noisier timesteps and lower ratios as the image becomes clearer. Extensive experiments on text-to-image and inpainting tasks show that DiffCR effectively captures dynamism across token, layer, and timestep axes, achieving superior trade-offs between generation quality and efficiency compared to prior works.

This computational burden primarily arises from the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage. We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to 3$\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\times$ for video generation, all while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tyfeld.github.io/BottleneckSampling.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://tyfeld.github.io/BottleneckSampling.github.io) |

Existing de-biasing techniques rely heavily on additional training, which imposes high computational costs and risks of compromising core image generation functionality. This hinders them from being widely adopted to real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Stable Diffusion's overlooked potential to reduce bias without requiring additional training. Through our analysis, we uncover that initial noises associated with minority attributes form "minority regions" rather than scattered. We view these "minority regions" as opportunities in SD to reduce bias. To unlock the potential, we propose a novel de-biasing method called 'weak guidance,' carefully designed to guide a random noise to the minority regions without compromising semantic integrity. Through analysis and experiments on various versions of SD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces bias without additional training, achieving both efficiency and preservation of core image generation functionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages; First two authors contributed equally; Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

UGen converts both texts and images into discrete token sequences and utilizes a single transformer to generate them uniformly in an autoregressive manner. To address the challenges associated with unified multimodal learning, UGen is trained using a novel mechanism, namely progressive vocabulary learning. In this process, visual token IDs are incrementally activated and integrated into the training phase, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of unified multimodal learning. Experiments on comprehensive text and image tasks show that UGen achieves a significant overall performance improvement of 13.3% compared to the vanilla unified autoregressive method, and it also delivers competitive results across all tasks against several task-specific models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite producing high-quality graphics and adequately receiving player input, existing models often fail to maintain fundamental game properties such as numerical and spatial consistency. Numerical consistency ensures gameplay mechanics correctly reflect score changes and other quantitative elements, while spatial consistency prevents jarring scene transitions, providing seamless player experiences. In this paper, we revisit the paradigm of generative games to explore what truly constitutes a Model as a Game (MaaG) with a well-developed mechanism. We begin with an empirical study on ``Traveler'', a 2D game created by an LLM featuring minimalist rules yet challenging generative models in maintaining consistency. Based on the DiT architecture, we design two specialized modules: (1) a numerical module that integrates a LogicNet to determine event triggers, with calculations processed externally as conditions for image generation; and (2) a spatial module that maintains a map of explored areas, retrieving location-specific information during generation and linking new observations to ensure continuity. Experiments across three games demonstrate that our integrated modules significantly enhance performance on consistency metrics compared to baselines, while incurring minimal time overhead during inference.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

It enables precise capture of detailed, localized defect features and their seamless integration into defect-free objects. Additionally, our Low-Fidelity Selection method further enhances the defect sample quality.

| **[Towards Better Alignment: Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning Against Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11240v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation. However, their practical applications are hindered by the misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. To tackle this issue, reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered for diffusion model fine-tuning. Yet, RL's effectiveness is limited by the challenge of sparse reward, where feedback is only available at the end of the generation process. This makes it difficult to identify which actions during the denoising process contribute positively to the final generated image, potentially leading to ineffective or unnecessary denoising policies. To this end, this paper presents a novel RL-based framework that addresses the sparse reward problem when training diffusion models. Our framework, named $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$, employs two strategies: \textbf{B}ackward progressive training and \textbf{B}ranch-based sampling. For one thing, backward progressive training focuses initially on the final timesteps of denoising process and gradually extends the training interval to earlier timesteps, easing the learning difficulty from sparse rewards. For another, we perform branch-based sampling for each training interval. By comparing the samples within the same branch, we can identify how much the policies of the current training interval contribute to the final image, which helps to learn effective policies instead of unnecessary ones. $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ is compatible with existing optimization algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ in improving prompt-image alignment and maintaining diversity in generated images.

We address these challenges through two key modules: 1) Janus-Pro-driven Prompt Parsing, a prompt-layout parsing module that bridges text understanding and layout generation via a compact 1B-parameter architecture, and 2) MIGLoRA, a parameter-efficient plug-in integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into UNet (SD1.5) and DiT (SD3) backbones. MIGLoRA is capable of preserving the base model's parameters and ensuring plug-and-play adaptability, minimizing architectural intrusion while enabling efficient fine-tuning. To support a comprehensive evaluation, we create DescripBox and DescripBox-1024, benchmarks that span diverse scenes and resolutions. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on COCO and LVIS benchmarks while maintaining parameter efficiency, demonstrating superior layout fidelity and scalability for open-world synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by this success, we investigate whether video generators similarly exhibit 3D-awareness. Using structure-from-motion as a 3D-aware task, we test if intermediate features of a video generator - OpenSora in our case - can support camera pose estimation. Surprisingly, at first, we only find a weak correlation between the two tasks. Deeper investigation reveals that although the video generator produces plausible video frames, the frames themselves are not truly 3D-consistent. Instead, we propose to jointly train for the two tasks, using photometric generation and 3D aware errors. Specifically, we find that SoTA video generation and camera pose estimation (i.e.,DUSt3R [79]) networks share common structures, and propose an architecture that unifies the two. The proposed unified model, named \nameMethod, produces camera pose estimates with competitive quality while producing 3D-consistent videos. In summary, we propose the first unified video generator that is 3D-consistent, generates realistic video frames, and can potentially be repurposed for other 3D-aware tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

These models jointly handle images, text, video, and audio for various tasks such as image captioning, question answering, and image generation. In this work, we explore discrete diffusion models as a unified generative formulation in the joint text and image domain, building upon their recent success in text generation. Discrete diffusion models offer several advantages over AR models, including improved control over quality versus diversity of generated samples, the ability to perform joint multimodal inpainting (across both text and image domains), and greater controllability in generation through guidance. Leveraging these benefits, we present the first Unified Multimodal Discrete Diffusion (UniDisc) model which is capable of jointly understanding and generating text and images for a variety of downstream tasks. We compare UniDisc to multimodal AR models, performing a scaling analysis and demonstrating that UniDisc outperforms them in terms of both performance and inference-time compute, enhanced controllability, editability, inpainting, and flexible trade-off between inference time and generation quality.

Recent diffusion distillation research has achieved excellent results for high-resolution text-to-image generation with methods such as phased consistency models (PCM) and improved distribution matching distillation (DMD2). However, these methods generally require many GPUs (e.g.~8-64) and significant batchsizes (e.g.~128-2048) during training, resulting in memory and compute requirements that are beyond the resources of some researchers. RAPM provides effective single-GPU diffusion distillation training with a batchsize of 1. The new method attempts to mimic the sampling trajectories of the teacher model by matching the relative and absolute positions. The design of relative positions is inspired by PCM. Two discriminators are introduced accordingly in RAPM, one for matching relative positions and the other for absolute positions. Experimental results on StableDiffusion (SD) V1.5 and SDXL indicate that RAPM with 4 timesteps produces comparable FID scores as the best method with 1 timestep under very limited computational resources.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data. In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e., Infographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG. We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set.

We present the first work specifically focused on long text image generation, addressing a critical gap in existing text-to-image systems that typically handle only brief phrases or single sentences.

However, existing methods often struggle with complex spatial relationships and fine-grained control over multiple concepts. Many existing approaches require significant architectural modifications, extensive training, or expert-level prompt engineering. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{LayerCraft}, an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents for structured procedural generation. LayerCraft enables users to customize objects within an image and supports narrative-driven creation with minimal effort.

To address these issues, in this study we introduce a novel framework, Indirect Prompt Gradient Optimization (IPGO), for prompt-level fine-tuning. IPGO enhances prompt embeddings by injecting continuously differentiable tokens at the beginning and end of the prompt embeddings, while exploiting low-rank benefits and flexibility from rotations. It allows for gradient-based optimization of injected tokens while enforcing value, orthonormality, and conformity constraints, facilitating continuous updates and empowering computational efficiency. To evaluate the performance of IPGO, we conduct prompt-wise and prompt-batch training with three reward models targeting image aesthetics, image-text alignment, and human preferences under three datasets of different complexity. The results show that IPGO consistently matches or outperforms cutting-edge benchmarks, including stable diffusion v1.5 with raw prompts, training-based approaches (DRaFT and DDPO), and training-free methods (DPO-Diffusion, Promptist, and ChatGPT-4o).

Although this evolution has significantly enhanced the models' ability to understand complex prompts and generate text, it also leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters. Despite T5 series encoders being trained on the C4 natural language corpus, which includes a significant amount of non-visual data, diffusion models with T5 encoder do not respond to those non-visual prompts, indicating redundancy in representational power. Therefore, it raises an important question: "Do we really need such a large text encoder?" In pursuit of an answer, we employ vision-based knowledge distillation to train a series of T5 encoder models. To fully inherit its capabilities, we constructed our dataset based on three criteria: image quality, semantic understanding, and text-rendering. Our results demonstrate the scaling down pattern that the distilled T5-base model can generate images of comparable quality to those produced by T5-XXL, while being 50 times smaller in size. This reduction in model size significantly lowers the GPU requirements for running state-of-the-art models such as FLUX and SD3, making high-quality text-to-image generation more accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Aesthetic Post-Training Diffusion Models from Generic Preferences with Step-by-step Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04314v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating visually appealing images is fundamental to modern text-to-image generation models. A potential solution to better aesthetics is direct preference optimization (DPO), which has been applied to diffusion models to improve general image quality including prompt alignment and aesthetics. Popular DPO methods propagate preference labels from clean image pairs to all the intermediate steps along the two generation trajectories. However, preference labels provided in existing datasets are blended with layout and aesthetic opinions, which would disagree with aesthetic preference. Even if aesthetic labels were provided (at substantial cost), it would be hard for the two-trajectory methods to capture nuanced visual differences at different steps. To improve aesthetics economically, this paper uses existing generic preference data and introduces step-by-step preference optimization (SPO) that discards the propagation strategy and allows fine-grained image details to be assessed. Specifically, at each denoising step, we 1) sample a pool of candidates by denoising from a shared noise latent, 2) use a step-aware preference model to find a suitable win-lose pair to supervise the diffusion model, and 3) randomly select one from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This strategy ensures that diffusion models focus on the subtle, fine-grained visual differences instead of layout aspect. We find that aesthetics can be significantly enhanced by accumulating these improved minor differences. When fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL, SPO yields significant improvements in aesthetics compared with existing DPO methods while not sacrificing image-text alignment compared with vanilla models. Moreover, SPO converges much faster than DPO methods due to the use of more correct preference labels provided by the step-aware preference model.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[EmoAttack: Emotion-to-Image Diffusion Models for Emotional Backdoor Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15863v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models can generate realistic images based on textual inputs, enabling users to convey their opinions visually through language. Meanwhile, within language, emotion plays a crucial role in expressing personal opinions in our daily lives and the inclusion of maliciously negative content can lead users astray, exacerbating negative emotions. Recognizing the success of diffusion models and the significance of emotion, we investigate a previously overlooked risk associated with text-to-image diffusion models, that is, utilizing emotion in the input texts to introduce negative content and provoke unfavorable emotions in users. Specifically, we identify a new backdoor attack, i.e., emotion-aware backdoor attack (EmoAttack), which introduces malicious negative content triggered by emotional texts during image generation. We formulate such an attack as a diffusion personalization problem to avoid extensive model retraining and propose the EmoBooth. Unlike existing personalization methods, our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained diffusion model by establishing a mapping between a cluster of emotional words and a given reference image containing malicious negative content. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we built a dataset and conducted extensive analysis and discussion about its effectiveness. Given consumers' widespread use of diffusion models, uncovering this threat is critical for society.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods aimed at safeguarding artworks often employ adversarial attacks. However, these methods face challenges such as poor transferability, high computational costs, and the introduction of noticeable noise, which compromises the aesthetic quality of the original artwork. To address these limitations, we propose a Structurally Imperceptible and Transferable Adversarial (SITA) attacks. SITA leverages a CLIP-based destylization loss, which decouples and disrupts the robust style representation of the image. This disruption hinders style extraction during stylized image generation, thereby impairing the overall stylization process. Importantly, SITA eliminates the need for a surrogate diffusion model, leading to significantly reduced computational overhead. The method's robust style feature disruption ensures high transferability across diverse models. Moreover, SITA introduces perturbations by embedding noise within the imperceptible structural details of the image. This approach effectively protects against style extraction without compromising the visual quality of the artwork. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SITA offers superior protection for artworks against unauthorized use in stylized generation. It significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of transferability, computational efficiency, and noise imperceptibility.

To address this, we propose FADE (Fine grained Attenuation for Diffusion Erasure), introducing adjacency aware unlearning in diffusion models. FADE comprises two components: (1) the Concept Neighborhood, which identifies an adjacency set of related concepts, and (2) Mesh Modules, employing a structured combination of Expungement, Adjacency, and Guidance loss components. These enable precise erasure of target concepts while preserving fidelity across related and unrelated concepts. Evaluated on datasets like Stanford Dogs, Oxford Flowers, CUB, I2P, Imagenette, and ImageNet1k, FADE effectively removes target concepts with minimal impact on correlated concepts, achieving atleast a 12% improvement in retention performance over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, they still face slow generation speeds due to sequential denoising processes. To address this, a parallel sampling method based on Picard iteration was introduced, effectively reducing sequential steps while ensuring exact convergence to the original output. Nonetheless, Picard iteration does not guarantee faster convergence, which can still result in slow generation in practice. In this work, we propose a new parallelization scheme, the Picard Consistency Model (PCM), which significantly reduces the number of generation steps in Picard iteration. Inspired by the consistency model, PCM is directly trained to predict the fixed-point solution, or the final output, at any stage of the convergence trajectory. Additionally, we introduce a new concept called model switching, which addresses PCM's limitations and ensures exact convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCM achieves up to a 2.71x speedup over sequential sampling and a 1.77x speedup over Picard iteration across various tasks, including image generation and robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

While recent methods have attempted to address this limitation, they typically lack sufficient parameter and memory efficiency. We propose VectorFit, an effective and easily deployable approach that adaptively trains the singular vectors and biases of pre-trained weight matrices. We demonstrate that the utilization of structural and transformational characteristics of pre-trained weights enables high-rank updates comparable to those of full fine-tuning. As a result, VectorFit achieves superior performance with 9X less trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Through extensive experiments over 17 datasets spanning diverse language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we exhibit that VectorFit consistently outperforms baselines, even in extremely low-budget scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dissecting CLIP: Decomposition with a Schur Complement-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18645v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of CLIP embeddings to assess the alignment of samples produced by text-to-image generative models has been extensively explored in the literature. While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the relevance of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which is responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the \textit{Schur Complement Entropy (SCE)} score, a measure of the intrinsic diversity of a text-to-image model based on data collected with varying text prompts. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt in the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of embeddings on specific objects or properties for downstream tasks. We present several numerical results that apply our Schur complement-based approach to evaluate text-to-image models and modify CLIP image embeddings.

Existing GAN-based methods suffer from either distortions and visual artifacts or poor reconstruction quality, i.e., the background and several important appearance details, such as hair style/color, glasses and accessories, are not faithfully reconstructed. Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) enable the generation of high-quality realistic images. To this end, in this paper we present DiffusionAct, a novel method that leverages the photo-realistic image generation of diffusion models to perform neural face reenactment. Specifically, we propose to control the semantic space of a Diffusion Autoencoder (DiffAE), in order to edit the facial pose of the input images, defined as the head pose orientation and the facial expressions. Our method allows one-shot, self, and cross-subject reenactment, without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning.

Existing methods primarily focus on either facial synthesis or near-frontal body generation, with limited ability to simultaneously control key factors such as viewpoint, pose, clothing, and identity in a disentangled manner. In this paper, we introduce a new disentangled and controllable human synthesis task, which explicitly separates and manipulates these four factors within a unified framework. We first develop an end-to-end generative model trained on MVHumanNet for factor disentanglement. However, the domain gap between MVHumanNet and in-the-wild data produce unsatisfacotry results, motivating the exploration of virtual try-on (VTON) dataset as a potential solution. Through experiments, we observe that simply incorporating the VTON dataset as additional data to train the end-to-end model degrades performance, primarily due to the inconsistency in data forms between the two datasets, which disrupts the disentanglement process. To better leverage both datasets, we propose a stage-by-stage framework that decomposes human image generation into three sequential steps: clothed A-pose generation, back-view synthesis, and pose and view control. This structured pipeline enables better dataset utilization at different stages, significantly improving controllability and generalization, especially for in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our stage-by-stage approach outperforms end-to-end models in both visual fidelity and disentanglement quality, offering a scalable solution for real-world tasks.

Existing diffusion models struggle with scaling beyond their training resolutions, often leading to structural distortions or content repetition. Reference-based methods address the issues by upsampling a low-resolution reference to guide higher-resolution generation. However, they face significant challenges: upsampling in latent space often causes manifold deviation, which degrades output quality. On the other hand, upsampling in RGB space tends to produce overly smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations, LSRNA combines Latent space Super-Resolution (LSR) for manifold alignment and Region-wise Noise Addition (RNA) to enhance high-frequency details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating LSRNA outperforms state-of-the-art reference-based methods across various resolutions and metrics, while showing the critical role of latent space upsampling in preserving detail and sharpness.

However, if one asks the generator to synthesize a specific camera setting such as creating different fields of view using a 24mm lens versus a 70mm lens, the generator will not be able to interpret and generate scene-consistent images. This limitation not only hinders the adoption of generative tools in professional photography but also highlights the broader challenge of aligning data-driven models with real-world physical settings. In this paper, we introduce Generative Photography, a framework that allows controlling camera intrinsic settings during content generation. The core innovation of this work are the concepts of Dimensionality Lifting and Differential Camera Intrinsics Learning, enabling smooth and consistent transitions across different camera settings.

To avoid generating unstructured ineffective reasoning steps, we develop an automatic pipeline to curate a high-quality ImageGen-CoT dataset. We then fine-tune MLLMs using this dataset to enhance their contextual reasoning capabilities. To further enhance performance, we explore test-time scale-up strategies and propose a novel hybrid scaling approach. This approach first generates multiple ImageGen-CoT chains and then produces multiple images for each chain via sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, fine-tuning with the ImageGen-CoT dataset leads to a substantial 80\% performance gain for SEED-X on T2I-ICL tasks. See our project page at https://ImageGen-CoT.github.io/.

In this paper, we explore how to decode textual prompts from reference images, a process we refer to as image reverse prompt engineering. This technique enables us to gain insights from reference images, understand the creative processes of great artists, and generate impressive new images. To address this challenge, we propose a method known as automatic reverse prompt optimization (ARPO). Specifically, our method refines an initial prompt into a high-quality prompt through an iteratively imitative gradient prompt optimization process: 1) generating a recreated image from the current prompt to instantiate its guidance capability; 2) producing textual gradients, which are candidate prompts intended to reduce the difference between the recreated image and the reference image; 3) updating the current prompt with textual gradients using a greedy search method to maximize the CLIP similarity between prompt and reference image. We compare ARPO with several baseline methods, including handcrafted techniques, gradient-based prompt tuning methods, image captioning, and data-driven selection method. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our ARPO converges quickly to generate high-quality reverse prompts. More importantly, we can easily create novel images with diverse styles and content by directly editing these reverse prompts. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, restoring heavily distorted information under dense haze requires generative diffusion models, whose potential in dehazing remains underutilized partly due to their lengthy sampling processes. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel hazing-dehazing pipeline consisting of a Realistic Hazy Image Generation framework (HazeGen) and a Diffusion-based Dehazing framework (DiffDehaze). Specifically, HazeGen harnesses robust generative diffusion priors of real-world hazy images embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. By employing specialized hybrid training and blended sampling strategies, HazeGen produces realistic and diverse hazy images as high-quality training data for DiffDehaze. To alleviate the inefficiency and fidelity concerns associated with diffusion-based methods, DiffDehaze adopts an Accelerated Fidelity-Preserving Sampling process (AccSamp). The core of AccSamp is the Tiled Statistical Alignment Operation (AlignOp), which can provide a clean and faithful dehazing estimate within a small fraction of sampling steps to reduce complexity and enable effective fidelity guidance.

Given that it is infeasible to directly train a model on 'whole' images from domains with potential gigapixel sizes, diffusion-based generative methods have focused on synthesizing small, fixed-size patches extracted from these images. However, generating small patches has limited applicability since patch-based models fail to capture the global structures and wider context of large images, which can be crucial for synthesizing (semantically) accurate samples. To overcome this limitation, we present ZoomLDM, a diffusion model tailored for generating images across multiple scales. Central to our approach is a novel magnification-aware conditioning mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings and allows the diffusion model to synthesize images at different 'zoom' levels, i.e., fixed-size patches extracted from large images at varying scales. ZoomLDM synthesizes coherent histopathology images that remain contextually accurate and detailed at different zoom levels, achieving state-of-the-art image generation quality across all scales and excelling in the data-scarce setting of generating thumbnails of entire large images. The multi-scale nature of ZoomLDM unlocks additional capabilities in large image generation, enabling computationally tractable and globally coherent image synthesis up to $4096 \times 4096$ pixels and $4\times$ super-resolution. Additionally, multi-scale features extracted from ZoomLDM are highly effective in multiple instance learning experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving accurate text-image alignment for LMMs, particularly in compositional scenarios, remains challenging. Existing approaches, such as layout planning for multi-step generation and learning from human feedback or AI feedback, depend heavily on prompt engineering, costly human annotations, and continual upgrading, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic iterative self-improvement framework (SILMM) that can enable LMMs to provide helpful and scalable self-feedback and optimize text-image alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO can readily applied to LMMs that use discrete visual tokens as intermediate image representations; while it is less suitable for LMMs with continuous visual features, as obtaining generation probabilities is challenging. To adapt SILMM to LMMs with continuous features, we propose a diversity mechanism to obtain diverse representations and a kernel-based continuous DPO for alignment.

A classic solution is text-to-image retrieval from an existing database; however, the limited database typically lacks creativity. By contrast, recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation have made it possible to produce attractive and counterfactual visual content, but it faces challenges in synthesizing knowledge-intensive images.

Specifically, we first explore the intrinsic discriminative abilities of LMMs and introduce an efficient generative retrieval method for text-to-image retrieval in a training-free manner. Subsequently, we unify generation and retrieval autoregressively and propose an autonomous decision mechanism to choose the best-matched one between generated and retrieved images as the response to the text prompt. To standardize the evaluation of unified text-to-image generation and retrieval, we construct TIGeR-Bench, a benchmark spanning both creative and knowledge-intensive domains.

However, one of the primary failure modes of these text-to-image generative models is in composing attributes, objects, and their associated relationships accurately into an image. In our paper, we investigate compositional attribute binding failures, where the model fails to correctly associate descriptive attributes (such as color, shape, or texture) with the corresponding objects in the generated images, and highlight that imperfect text conditioning with CLIP text-encoder is one of the primary reasons behind the inability of these models to generate high-fidelity compositional scenes. In particular, we show that (i) there exists an optimal text-embedding space that can generate highly coherent compositional scenes showing that the output space of the CLIP text-encoder is sub-optimal, and (ii) the final token embeddings in CLIP are erroneous as they often include attention contributions from unrelated tokens in compositional prompts. Our main finding shows that significant compositional improvements can be achieved (without harming the model's FID score) by fine-tuning only a simple and parameter-efficient linear projection on CLIP's representation space in Stable-Diffusion variants using a small set of compositional image-text pairs.</p></details> |  | None |

Nonetheless, these strategies fail to generalize to novel styles and have technical constraints, particularly in terms of maximum output length and training efficiency. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a novel framework for text image generation, dubbed Emuru. Our approach leverages a powerful text image representation model (a variational autoencoder) combined with an autoregressive Transformer. Our approach enables the generation of styled text images conditioned on textual content and style examples, such as specific fonts or handwriting styles. We train our model solely on a diverse, synthetic dataset of English text rendered in over 100,000 typewritten and calligraphy fonts, which gives it the capability to reproduce unseen styles (both fonts and users' handwriting) in zero-shot. To the best of our knowledge, Emuru is the first autoregressive model for HTG, and the first designed specifically for generalization to novel styles. Moreover, our model generates images without background artifacts, which are easier to use for downstream applications. Extensive evaluation on both typewritten and handwritten, any-length text image generation scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | Accepted at CVPR2025 | None |
| **[Interleaved Scene Graphs for Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17188v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world user queries (e.g. "How do to make egg fried rice?") could benefit from systems capable of generating responses with both textual steps with accompanying images, similar to a cookbook. Models designed to generate interleaved text and images face challenges in ensuring consistency within and across these modalities. To address these challenges, we present ISG, a comprehensive evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation. ISG leverages a scene graph structure to capture relationships between text and image blocks, evaluating responses on four levels of granularity: holistic, structural, block-level, and image-specific. This multi-tiered evaluation allows for a nuanced assessment of consistency, coherence, and accuracy, and provides interpretable question-answer feedback. In conjunction with ISG, we introduce a benchmark, ISG-Bench, encompassing 1,150 samples across 8 categories and 21 subcategories. This benchmark dataset includes complex language-vision dependencies and golden answers to evaluate models effectively on vision-centric tasks such as style transfer, a challenging area for current models. Using ISG-Bench, we demonstrate that recent unified vision-language models perform poorly on generating interleaved content. While compositional approaches that combine separate language and image models show a 111% improvement over unified models at the holistic level, their performance remains suboptimal at both block and image levels. To facilitate future work, we develop ISG-Agent, a baseline agent employing a "plan-execute-refine" pipeline to invoke tools, achieving a 122% performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025 as Spotlight.

We propose a self-supervised learning approach where the system learns transformations independently by reconstructing images that have undergone previously unseen transformations. Specifically, the model is tasked to reconstruct intermediate transformed images, e.g. translated or rotated images, without prior knowledge of these transformations. This auxiliary task encourages the model to develop equivariance-coherent features without relying on predefined transformation rules. To this end, we apply transformations to the input image, generating an image pair, and then split the extracted features into two sets per image. One set is used with a usual SSL loss encouraging invariance, the other with our loss based on the auxiliary task to reconstruct the intermediate transformed images. Our loss and the SSL loss are linearly combined with weighted terms. Evaluating on synthetic tasks with natural images, our proposed method strongly outperforms all competitors, regardless of whether they are designed to learn equivariance. Furthermore, when trained alongside augmentation-based methods as the invariance tasks, such as iBOT or DINOv2, we successfully learn a balanced combination of invariant and equivariant features. Our approach performs strong on a rich set of realistic computer vision downstream tasks, almost always improving over all baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosting Resolution Generalization of Diffusion Transformers with Randomized Positional Encodings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18719v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resolution generalization in image generation tasks enables the production of higher-resolution images with lower training resolution overhead. However, a significant challenge in resolution generalization, particularly in the widely used Diffusion Transformers, lies in the mismatch between the positional encodings encountered during testing and those used during training. While existing methods have employed techniques such as interpolation, extrapolation, or their combinations, none have fully resolved this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional randomized positional encodings (RPE-2D) framework that focuses on learning positional order of image patches instead of the specific distances between them, enabling seamless high- and low-resolution image generation without requiring high- and low-resolution image training. Specifically, RPE-2D independently selects positions over a broader range along both the horizontal and vertical axes, ensuring that all position encodings are trained during the inference phase, thus improving resolution generalization. Additionally, we propose a random data augmentation technique to enhance the modeling of position order. To address the issue of image cropping caused by the augmentation, we introduce corresponding micro-conditioning to enable the model to perceive the specific cropping patterns. On the ImageNet dataset, our proposed RPE-2D achieves state-of-the-art resolution generalization performance, outperforming existing competitive methods when trained at a resolution of $256 \times 256$ and inferred at $384 \times 384$ and $512 \times 512$, as well as when scaling from $512 \times 512$ to $768 \times 768$ and $1024 \times 1024$. And it also exhibits outstanding capabilities in low-resolution image generation, multi-stage training acceleration and multi-resolution inheritance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18556v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant success of Large Vision-Language models(LVLMs), these models still suffer hallucinations when describing images, generating answers that include non-existent objects. It is reported that these models tend to over-focus on certain irrelevant image tokens that do not contain critical information for answering the question and distort the output. To address this, we propose an Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention(IAVA) approach, which identifies irrelevant tokens by comparing changes in attention weights under two different instructions. By applying contrastive decoding, we dynamically adjust the logits generated from original image tokens and irrelevant image tokens, reducing the model's over-attention to irrelevant information. The experimental results demonstrate that IAVA consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques on benchmarks such as MME, POPE, and TextVQA in mitigating object hallucinations.

Unlike prior methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body structure and scene variations. Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs. Extensive ablation studies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual Persona across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project page is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Visual-Persona</p></details> | [Code Link](https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Visual-Persona) |
| **[MMO-IG: Multi-Class and Multi-Scale Object Image Generation for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13684v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of deep generative models (DGMs) has significantly advanced research in computer vision, providing a cost-effective alternative to acquiring vast quantities of expensive imagery. However, existing methods predominantly focus on synthesizing remote sensing (RS) images aligned with real images in a global layout view, which limits their applicability in RS image object detection (RSIOD) research. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-class and multi-scale object image generator based on DGMs, termed MMO-IG, designed to generate RS images with supervised object labels from global and local aspects simultaneously. Specifically, from the local view, MMO-IG encodes various RS instances using an iso-spacing instance map (ISIM). During the generation process, it decodes each instance region with iso-spacing value in ISIM-corresponding to both background and foreground instances-to produce RS images through the denoising process of diffusion models. Considering the complex interdependencies among MMOs, we construct a spatial-cross dependency knowledge graph (SCDKG). This ensures a realistic and reliable multidirectional distribution among MMOs for region embedding, thereby reducing the discrepancy between source and target domains. Besides, we propose a structured object distribution instruction (SODI) to guide the generation of synthesized RS image content from a global aspect with SCDKG-based ISIM together. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MMO-IG exhibits superior generation capabilities for RS images with dense MMO-supervised labels, and RS detectors pre-trained with MMO-IG show excellent performance on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing techniques addressing these issues for responsible T2I models aim for the generated content to be fair and safe (non-violent/explicit). However, these methods remain bounded to handling the facets of responsibility concepts individually, while also lacking in interpretability. Moreover, they often require alteration to the original model, which compromises the model performance. In this work, we propose a unique technique to enable responsible T2I generation by simultaneously accounting for an extensive range of concepts for fair and safe content generation in a scalable manner. The key idea is to distill the target T2I pipeline with an external plug-and-play mechanism that learns an interpretable composite responsible space for the desired concepts, conditioned on the target T2I pipeline. We use knowledge distillation and concept whitening to enable this. At inference, the learned space is utilized to modulate the generative content. A typical T2I pipeline presents two plug-in points for our approach, namely; the text embedding space and the diffusion model latent space. We develop modules for both points and show the effectiveness of our approach with a range of strong results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Flowing from Words to Pixels: A Noise-Free Framework for Cross-Modality Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15213v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, and their generalization, flow matching, have had a remarkable impact on the field of media generation. Here, the conventional approach is to learn the complex mapping from a simple source distribution of Gaussian noise to the target media distribution. For cross-modal tasks such as text-to-image generation, this same mapping from noise to image is learnt whilst including a conditioning mechanism in the model. One key and thus far relatively unexplored feature of flow matching is that, unlike Diffusion models, they are not constrained for the source distribution to be noise. Hence, in this paper, we propose a paradigm shift, and ask the question of whether we can instead train flow matching models to learn a direct mapping from the distribution of one modality to the distribution of another, thus obviating the need for both the noise distribution and conditioning mechanism. We present a general and simple framework, CrossFlow, for cross-modal flow matching. We show the importance of applying Variational Encoders to the input data, and introduce a method to enable Classifier-free guidance. Surprisingly, for text-to-image, CrossFlow with a vanilla transformer without cross attention slightly outperforms standard flow matching, and we show that it scales better with training steps and model size, while also allowing for interesting latent arithmetic which results in semantically meaningful edits in the output space. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we also show that CrossFlow is on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art for various cross-modal / intra-modal mapping tasks, viz. image captioning, depth estimation, and image super-resolution. We hope this paper contributes to accelerating progress in cross-modal media generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 camera-ready version.

However, the compression process of LDM often results in the deterioration of details, particularly in sensitive areas such as facial features and clothing textures. In this paper, we propose a Multi-focal Conditioned Latent Diffusion (MCLD) method to address these limitations by conditioning the model on disentangled, pose-invariant features from these sensitive regions. Our approach utilizes a multi-focal condition aggregation module, which effectively integrates facial identity and texture-specific information, enhancing the model's ability to produce appearance realistic and identity-consistent images. Our method demonstrates consistent identity and appearance generation on the DeepFashion dataset and enables flexible person image editing due to its generation consistency.

These methods allow for quick adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal computational cost. However, popular finetuning methods such as LoRA exhibit limited robustness when it comes to hyperparameter choices or extended training regimes, preventing optimal out-of-the-box performance. In contrast, bounded approaches, such as ETHER, provide greater robustness but are limited to extremely low-rank adaptations and fixed-strength transformations, reducing their adaptation expressive power. In this work, we propose Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA), a novel finetuning method that normalizes and scales learnable low-rank matrices. By bounding the distance of the transformation, DeLoRA effectively decouples the angular learning from the adaptation strength, enhancing robustness without compromising performance. Through evaluations on subject-driven image generation, natural language understanding, and instruction tuning, we show that DeLoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing PEFT methods, while exhibiting stronger robustness.

This development creates a series of societal risks, and challenges our perception of what is true and what is not, particularly with the emergence of "deep fakes" that impersonate real individuals. Watermarking, a technique that involves embedding identifying information within images to indicate their AI-generated nature, has emerged as a primary mechanism to address the risks posed by AI-generated images. The implementation of watermarking techniques is now becoming a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, including under the new 2024 EU AI Act. Despite the widespread use of AI image generation systems, the current status of watermarking implementation remains largely unexamined. Moreover, the practical implications of the AI Act's watermarking requirements have not previously been studied. The present paper therefore both provides an empirical analysis of 50 of the most widely used AI systems for image generation, and embeds this empirical analysis into a legal analysis of the AI Act. We identify four categories of generative AI image systems relevant under the AI Act, outline the legal obligations for each category, and find that only a minority number of providers currently implement adequate watermarking practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, note that this work has not been published in a peer reviewed venue yet.

CFG combines the conditional score (e.g., text-conditioned) with the unconditional score to control the output. However, the unconditional score is in charge of estimating the transition between manifolds of adjacent timesteps from $x_t$ to $x_{t-1}$, which may inadvertently interfere with the trajectory toward the specific condition. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a geometric perspective on the unconditional score to enhance CFG performance when conditional scores are available. Specifically, we propose a method that filters the singular vectors of both conditional and unconditional scores using singular value decomposition. This filtering process aligns the unconditional score with the conditional score, thereby refining the sampling trajectory to stay closer to the manifold. Our approach improves image quality with negligible additional computation. We provide deeper insights into the score function behavior in diffusion models and present a practical technique for achieving more accurate and contextually coherent image synthesis.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |

Building upon SANA-1.0, we introduce three key innovations: (1) Efficient Training Scaling: A depth-growth paradigm that enables scaling from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with significantly reduced computational resources, combined with a memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. (2) Model Depth Pruning: A block importance analysis technique for efficient model compression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time Scaling: A repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model capacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference time. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score of 0.81 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.96 through inference scaling with VILA-Judge, establishing a new SoTA on GenEval benchmark.

Additionally, the indeterminacy can be further exacerbated by issues such as occlusions and cluttered backgrounds. To handle such a challenging task, in this work, we begin with a key observation: the output of HOI detection for each human-object pair can be recast as an image. Thus, inspired by the strong image generation capabilities of image diffusion models, we propose a new framework, HOI-IDiff. In HOI-IDiff, we tackle HOI detection from a novel perspective, using an Image-like Diffusion process to generate HOI detection outputs as images. Furthermore, recognizing that our recast images differ in certain properties from natural images, we enhance our framework with a customized HOI diffusion process and a slice patchification model architecture, which are specifically tailored to generate our recast ``HOI images''.

SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100).

Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

GPTs rely on a local and greedy process of generating the next word, without a global understanding of the task or the output. We have confirmed the above limitations through specialized empirical studies of code comprehension. Although GPT-4 is good at producing fluent and coherent text, it cannot handle complex logic and generate new code that hasn't been seen, and it relies too much on the formatting of the prompt to generate the correct code. We propose a new paradigm for code understanding that goes beyond the next-word prediction paradigm, inspired by the successful application of diffusion techniques to image generation (Dalle-2, Sora) and protein structure generation (AlphaFold-3), which have no autoregressive constraints. Instead of encoding the code in a form that mimics natural language, we encode the code as a heterogeneous image paradigm with a memory of global information that mimics both images and protein structures. We then refer to Sora's CLIP upstream text-to-image encoder model to design a text-to-code encoder model that can be applied to various downstream code understanding tasks. The model learns the global understanding of code under the new paradigm heterogeneous image, connects the encoding space of text and code, and encodes the input of text into the vector of code most similar to it. Using self-supervised comparative learning on 456,360 text-code pairs, the model achieved a zero-shot prediction of new data. This work is the basis for future work on code generation using diffusion techniques under a new paradigm to avoid autoregressive limitations.</p></details> | 10 page, 14 figures | None |

For image generation, common metrics of visual quality (e.g., FID) and the perceived truthfulness of generated images seem to suggest that we are nearing this goal. However, through distribution classification tasks, we reveal that, from the perspective of neural network-based classifiers, even advanced diffusion models are still far from this goal. Specifically, classifiers are able to consistently and effortlessly distinguish real images from generated ones across various settings. Moreover, we uncover an intriguing discrepancy: classifiers can easily differentiate between diffusion models with comparable performance (e.g., U-ViT-H vs. DiT-XL), but struggle to distinguish between models within the same family but of different scales (e.g., EDM2-XS vs. EDM2-XXL). Our methodology carries several important implications. First, it naturally serves as a diagnostic tool for diffusion models by analyzing specific features of generated data. Second, it sheds light on the model autophagy disorder and offers insights into the use of generated data: augmenting real data with generated data is more effective than replacing it. Third, classifier guidance can significantly enhance the realism of generated images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Building upon this insight, we carefully explore the design space of training and sampling, identifying key factors that contribute to both performance and efficiency. Based on the improvements observed during this exploration, we develop our model, referred to as eMIGM. Empirically, eMIGM demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet generation, as measured by Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, with similar number of function evaluations (NFEs) and model parameters, eMIGM outperforms the seminal VAR. Moreover, as NFE and model parameters increase, eMIGM achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models while requiring less than 40% of the NFE.

Additionally, we introduce an interactive motion-guided control mechanism, where directional arrows define movement and colors adjust scaling, offering precise and intuitive control for designing game effects. To further alleviate data scarcity, we have developed a pipeline for creating an RGBA video dataset, incorporating high-quality game effect videos, extracted foreground objects, and synthetic transparent videos. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TransAnimate generates high-quality RGBA videos, establishing it as a practical and effective tool for applications in gaming and visual effects.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Diffusion Models with Deterministic Normalizing Flow Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01274v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For faster sampling and higher sample quality, we propose DiNof ($\textbf{Di}$ffusion with $\textbf{No}$rmalizing $\textbf{f}$low priors), a technique that makes use of normalizing flows and diffusion models. We use normalizing flows to parameterize the noisy data at any arbitrary step of the diffusion process and utilize it as the prior in the reverse diffusion process. More specifically, the forward noising process turns a data distribution into partially noisy data, which are subsequently transformed into a Gaussian distribution by a nonlinear process. The backward denoising procedure begins with a prior created by sampling from the Gaussian distribution and applying the invertible normalizing flow transformations deterministically. To generate the data distribution, the prior then undergoes the remaining diffusion stochastic denoising procedure. Through the reduction of the number of total diffusion steps, we are able to speed up both the forward and backward processes. More importantly, we improve the expressive power of diffusion models by employing both deterministic and stochastic mappings. Experiments on standard image generation datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, for example, we achieve an FID of 2.01 and an Inception score of 9.96. Our method also demonstrates competitive performance on CelebA-HQ-256 dataset as it obtains an FID score of 7.11.

To address this critical challenge, we propose FundusGAN, a novel hierarchical feature-aware generative framework specifically designed for high-fidelity fundus image synthesis. Our approach leverages a Feature Pyramid Network within its encoder to comprehensively extract multi-scale information, capturing both large anatomical structures and subtle pathological features. The framework incorporates a modified StyleGAN-based generator with dilated convolutions and strategic upsampling adjustments to preserve critical retinal structures while enhancing pathological detail representation. Comprehensive evaluations on the DDR, DRIVE, and IDRiD datasets demonstrate that FundusGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics (SSIM: 0.8863, FID: 54.2, KID: 0.0436 on DDR). Furthermore, disease classification experiments reveal that augmenting training data with FundusGAN-generated images significantly improves diagnostic accuracy across multiple CNN architectures (up to 6.49\% improvement with ResNet50). These results establish FundusGAN as a valuable foundation model component that effectively addresses data scarcity challenges in ophthalmological AI research, enabling more robust and generalizable diagnostic systems while reducing dependency on large-scale clinical data collection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Be More Diverse than the Most Diverse: Optimal Mixtures of Generative Models via Mixture-UCB Bandit Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17622v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of multiple training algorithms and architectures for generative models requires a selection mechanism to form a single model over a group of well-trained generation models. The selection task is commonly addressed by identifying the model that maximizes an evaluation score based on the diversity and quality of the generated data. However, such a best-model identification approach overlooks the possibility that a mixture of available models can outperform each individual model. In this work, we numerically show that a mixture of generative models on benchmark image datasets can indeed achieve a better evaluation score (based on FID and KID scores), compared to the individual models. This observation motivates the development of efficient algorithms for selecting the optimal mixture of the models. To address this, we formulate a quadratic optimization problem to find an optimal mixture model achieving the maximum of kernel-based evaluation scores including kernel inception distance (KID) and R\'enyi kernel entropy (RKE). To identify the optimal mixture of the models using the fewest possible sample queries, we view the selection task as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and propose the Mixture Upper Confidence Bound (Mixture-UCB) algorithm that provably converges to the optimal mixture of the involved models. More broadly, the proposed Mixture-UCB can be extended to optimize every convex quadratic function of the mixture weights in a general MAB setting. We prove a regret bound for the Mixture-UCB algorithm and perform several numerical experiments to show the success of Mixture-UCB in finding the optimal mixture of text and image generative models.

However, currently there is no straightforward and efficient framework to transfer the multimodal comprehension abilities of MLLMs to T2I models to enable them to understand multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose the X2I framework, which endows Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models with the capability to comprehend various modalities, including multilingual text, screenshot documents, images, videos, and audio. X2I is trained using merely 100K English corpus with 160 GPU hours. Building on the DiT teacher model, we adopt an innovative distillation method to extract the inference capabilities of the teacher model and design a lightweight AlignNet structure to serve as an intermediate bridge. Compared to the teacher model, X2I shows a decrease in performance degradation of less than 1\% while gaining various multimodal understanding abilities, including multilingual to image, image to image, image-text to image, video to image, audio to image, and utilizing creative fusion to enhance imagery. Furthermore, it is applicable for LoRA training in the context of image-text to image generation, filling a void in the industry in this area. We further design a simple LightControl to enhance the fidelity of instructional image editing. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, multifunctionality, and transferability of our X2I.

However, the intricate connections between nodes and diverse modules often present a steep learning curve for users. In this paper, we introduce ComfyGPT, the first self-optimizing multi-agent system designed to generate ComfyUI workflows based on task descriptions automatically. ComfyGPT comprises four specialized agents: ReformatAgent, FlowAgent, RefineAgent, and ExecuteAgent. The core innovation of ComfyGPT lies in two key aspects. First, it focuses on generating individual node links rather than entire workflows, significantly improving generation precision. Second, we proposed FlowAgent, a LLM-based workflow generation agent that uses both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve workflow generation accuracy. Moreover, we introduce FlowDataset, a large-scale dataset containing 13,571 workflow-description pairs, and FlowBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating workflow generation systems. We also propose four novel evaluation metrics: Format Validation (FV), Pass Accuracy (PA), Pass Instruct Alignment (PIA), and Pass Node Diversity (PND). Experimental results demonstrate that ComfyGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods in workflow generation.</p></details> |  | None |

It consists of two phases: the Initial Generation Phase, which creates base images based on user prompts, and the Interactive Refinement Phase, which integrates user feedback through three key modules. The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user feedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the alignment between user intent and model input. By evaluating generated outputs against user expectations, the Feedback-Reflection (FR) module identifies discrepancies and facilitates improvements. In an effort to ensure consistently high-quality results, the Adaptive Optimization (AO) module fine-tunes the generation process by balancing user preferences and maintaining prompt fidelity. Experimental results show that TDRI outperforms existing methods by achieving 33.6% human preference, compared to 6.2% for GPT-4 augmentation, and the highest CLIP and BLIP alignment scores (0.338 and 0.336, respectively). In iterative feedback tasks, user satisfaction increased to 88% after 8 rounds, with diminishing returns beyond 6 rounds. Furthermore, TDRI has been found to reduce the number of iterations and improve personalization in the creation of fashion products. TDRI exhibits a strong potential for a wide range of applications in the creative and industrial domains, as it streamlines the creative process and improves alignment with user preferences</p></details> |  | None |

In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Diffusion Training through Parallelization with Truncated Karhunen-Loève Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17657v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion denoising models have become a popular approach for image generation, but they often suffer from slow convergence during training. In this paper, we identify that this slow convergence is partly due to the complexity of the Brownian motion driving the forward-time process. To address this, we represent the Brownian motion using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, truncating it to a limited number of eigenfunctions. We propose a novel ordinary differential equation with augmented random initials, termed KL diffusion, as a new forward-time process for training and sampling. By developing an appropriate denoising loss function, we facilitate the integration of our KL-diffusion into existing denoising-based models. Using the widely adopted DDIM framework as our baseline ensures a fair comparison, as our modifications focus solely on the forward process and loss function, leaving the network architecture and sampling methods unchanged. Our method significantly outperforms baseline diffusion models, achieving convergence speeds that are twice faster to reach the best FID score of the baseline and ultimately yielding much lower FID scores. Notably, our approach allows for highly parallelized computation, requires no additional learnable parameters, and can be flexibly integrated into existing diffusion methods. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | None |

Despite the discovery of thousands of inscriptions, a vast expanse of OBS remains undeciphered, casting a veil of mystery over this ancient language. The emergence of modern AI technologies presents a novel frontier for OBS decipherment, challenging traditional NLP methods that rely heavily on large textual corpora, a luxury not afforded by historical languages. This paper introduces a novel approach by adopting image generation techniques, specifically through the development of Oracle Bone Script Decipher (OBSD). Utilizing a conditional diffusion-based strategy, OBSD generates vital clues for decipherment, charting a new course for AI-assisted analysis of ancient languages. To validate its efficacy, extensive experiments were conducted on an oracle bone script dataset, with quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of OBSD.

Reduced well-being is often linked to depression or anxiety disorders, which are characterised by biases in visual attention towards specific stimuli, such as human faces. This paper introduces a novel approach to AI-assisted screening of affective disorders by analysing visual attention scan paths using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Data were collected from two studies examining (1) attentional tendencies in individuals diagnosed with major depression and (2) social anxiety. These data were processed using residual CNNs through images generated from eye-gaze patterns. Experimental results, obtained with ResNet architectures, demonstrated an average accuracy of 48% for a three-class system and 62% for a two-class system. Based on these exploratory findings, we propose that this method could be employed in rapid, ecological, and effective mental health screening systems to assess well-being through eye-tracking.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, existing models often neglect the relationships between customized objects in generated images. In contrast, this work addresses this gap by focusing on relation-aware customized image generation, which seeks to preserve the identities from image prompts while maintaining the relationship specified in text prompts. Specifically, we introduce DreamRelation, a framework that disentangles identity and relation learning using a carefully curated dataset. Our training data consists of relation-specific images, independent object images containing identity information, and text prompts to guide relation generation. Then, we propose two key modules to tackle the two main challenges: generating accurate and natural relationships, especially when significant pose adjustments are required, and avoiding object confusion in cases of overlap. First, we introduce a keypoint matching loss that effectively guides the model in adjusting object poses closely tied to their relationships. Second, we incorporate local features of the image prompts to better distinguish between objects, preventing confusion in overlapping cases. Extensive results on our proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DreamRelation in generating precise relations while preserving object identities across a diverse set of objects and relationships.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

Since they are parameterized by deep learning models, they are often sensitive to distribution shifts and unreliable when applied to out-of-distribution data, creating a risk of, e.g. underrepresentation bias. This behavior can be flagged using uncertainty quantification methods for generative models, but their availability remains limited. We propose SLUG: A new UQ method for VAEs that combines recent advances in Laplace approximations with stochastic trace estimators to scale gracefully with image dimensionality. We show that our UQ score -- unlike the VAE's encoder variances -- correlates strongly with reconstruction error and racial underrepresentation bias for dermatological images. We also show how pixel-wise uncertainty can detect out-of-distribution image content such as ink, rulers, and patches, which is known to induce learning shortcuts in predictive models.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[Leveraging Text-to-Image Generation for Handling Spurious Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17226v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) perform well when both training and test data come from the same domain, but they often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. In image classification, these models may rely on spurious correlations that often exist between labels and irrelevant features of images, making predictions unreliable when those features do not exist. We propose a technique to generate training samples with text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models for addressing the spurious correlation problem. First, we compute the best describing token for the visual features pertaining to the causal components of samples by a textual inversion mechanism. Then, leveraging a language segmentation method and a diffusion model, we generate new samples by combining the causal component with the elements from other classes. We also meticulously prune the generated samples based on the prediction probabilities and attribution scores of the ERM model to ensure their correct composition for our objective. Finally, we retrain the ERM model on our augmented dataset. This process reduces the model's reliance on spurious correlations by learning from carefully crafted samples for in which this correlation does not exist. Our experiments show that across different benchmarks, our technique achieves better worst-group accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To meet modeling requirements, autoregressive models possessing the characteristics of scalability and flexibility embrace a discrete-valued tokenizer, but face the challenge of poor image generation quality. In contrast, diffusion models take advantage of the continuous-valued tokenizer to achieve better generation quality but are subject to low efficiency and complexity. The existing hybrid models are mainly to compensate for information loss and simplify the diffusion learning process. The potential of merging discrete-valued and continuous-valued tokens in the field of image generation has not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose D2C, a novel two-stage method to enhance model generation capacity. In the first stage, the discrete-valued tokens representing coarse-grained image features are sampled by employing a small discrete-valued generator. Then in the second stage, the continuous-valued tokens representing fine-grained image features are learned conditioned on the discrete token sequence. In addition, we design two kinds of fusion modules for seamless interaction. On the ImageNet-256 benchmark, extensive experiment results validate that our model achieves superior performance compared with several continuous-valued and discrete-valued generative models on the class-conditional image generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Halton Scheduler For Masked Generative Image Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17076v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Generative Image Transformers (MaskGIT) have emerged as a scalable and efficient image generation framework, able to deliver high-quality visuals with low inference costs. However, MaskGIT's token unmasking scheduler, an essential component of the framework, has not received the attention it deserves. We analyze the sampling objective in MaskGIT, based on the mutual information between tokens, and elucidate its shortcomings. We then propose a new sampling strategy based on our Halton scheduler instead of the original Confidence scheduler. More precisely, our method selects the token's position according to a quasi-random, low-discrepancy Halton sequence. Intuitively, that method spreads the tokens spatially, progressively covering the image uniformly at each step. Our analysis shows that it allows reducing non-recoverable sampling errors, leading to simpler hyper-parameters tuning and better quality images. Our scheduler does not require retraining or noise injection and may serve as a simple drop-in replacement for the original sampling strategy. Evaluation of both class-to-image synthesis on ImageNet and text-to-image generation on the COCO dataset demonstrates that the Halton scheduler outperforms the Confidence scheduler quantitatively by reducing the FID and qualitatively by generating more diverse and more detailed images.

However, these models sometimes fail to accurately capture all the details specified in the input prompts, particularly concerning entities, attributes, and spatial relationships. This issue becomes more pronounced when the prompt contains novel or complex compositions, leading to what are known as compositional generation failure modes. Recently, a new open-source diffusion-based T2I model, FLUX, has been introduced, demonstrating strong performance in high-quality image generation. Additionally, autoregressive T2I models like LlamaGen have claimed competitive visual quality performance compared to diffusion-based models. In this study, we evaluate the compositional generation capabilities of these newly introduced models against established models using the T2I-CompBench benchmark. Our findings reveal that LlamaGen, as a vanilla autoregressive model, is not yet on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models for compositional generation tasks under the same criteria, such as model size and inference time. On the other hand, the open-source diffusion-based model FLUX exhibits compositional generation capabilities comparable to the state-of-the-art closed-source model DALL-E3.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Compositional Learning: Perspectives, Methods, and Paths Forward</p></details> | None |

Utilizing synthetically generated images could offer a valuable alternative. In this work, we explore adapting text-to-image generative models for the surgical domain using the CholecT50 dataset, which provides surgical images annotated with action triplets (instrument, verb, target). We investigate several language models and find T5 to offer more distinct features for differentiating surgical actions on triplet-based textual inputs, and showcasing stronger alignment between long and triplet-based captions. To address challenges in training text-to-image models solely on triplet-based captions without additional inputs and supervisory signals, we discover that triplet text embeddings are instrument-centric in the latent space. Leveraging this insight, we design an instrument-based class balancing technique to counteract data imbalance and skewness, improving training convergence. Extending Imagen, a diffusion-based generative model, we develop Surgical Imagen to generate photorealistic and activity-aligned surgical images from triplet-based textual prompts. We assess the model on quality, alignment, reasoning, and knowledge, achieving FID and CLIP scores of 3.7 and 26.8% respectively. Human expert survey shows that participants were highly challenged by the realistic characteristics of the generated samples, demonstrating Surgical Imagen's effectiveness as a practical alternative to real data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, published in Pattern Recognition Letters 2025, project page at https://camma-public.github.io/endogen/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://camma-public.github.io/endogen) |

However, current diffusion-based methods struggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling multiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the first tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement in stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled style elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem. Our approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image embedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting Color-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference images. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely with the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to enhance color consistency. Additionally, to prevent texture loss due to the signal-leak bias inherent in diffusion training, we introduce a noise term that preserves textural fidelity during the Regularized Whitening and Coloring Transformation (RegWCT). Through these methods, our Style Attributes Disentanglement approach (SADis) delivers a more precise and customizable solution for stylized image generation. Experiments on images from the WikiArt and StyleDrop datasets demonstrate that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, SADis surpasses state-of-the-art stylization methods in the DisIG task.Code will be released at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be available at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io) |

This paper explores the critical role of preference data in the training process of diffusion models, particularly in the context of Diffusion-DPO and its subsequent adaptations. We investigate the complexities surrounding universal human preferences in image generation, highlighting the subjective nature of these preferences and the challenges posed by minority samples in preference datasets. Through pilot experiments, we demonstrate the existence of minority samples and their detrimental effects on model performance. We propose Adaptive-DPO -- a novel approach that incorporates a minority-instance-aware metric into the DPO objective. This metric, which includes intra-annotator confidence and inter-annotator stability, distinguishes between majority and minority samples. We introduce an Adaptive-DPO loss function which improves the DPO loss in two ways: enhancing the model's learning of majority labels while mitigating the negative impact of minority samples. Our experiments demonstrate that this method effectively handles both synthetic minority data and real-world preference data, paving the way for more effective training methodologies in image generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the quality and generalizability of 3D content generation remain limited. State-of-the-art methods often require large-scale 3D assets for training, which are challenging to collect. In this work, we introduce Kiss3DGen (Keep It Simple and Straightforward in 3D Generation), an efficient framework for generating, editing, and enhancing 3D objects by repurposing a well-trained 2D image diffusion model for 3D generation. Specifically, we fine-tune a diffusion model to generate ''3D Bundle Image'', a tiled representation composed of multi-view images and their corresponding normal maps. The normal maps are then used to reconstruct a 3D mesh, and the multi-view images provide texture mapping, resulting in a complete 3D model. This simple method effectively transforms the 3D generation problem into a 2D image generation task, maximizing the utilization of knowledge in pretrained diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Kiss3DGen model is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as 3D editing, mesh and texture enhancement, etc. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its ability to produce high-quality 3D models efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> | None |

It also matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including Gemini Pro and GPT-4V, according to human judgments on a new long-form mixed-modal generation evaluation, where either the prompt or outputs contain mixed sequences of both images and text. Chameleon marks a significant step forward in a unified modeling of full multimodal documents.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Safe and Reliable Diffusion Models via Subspace Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16835v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized image generation, enabling the synthesis of highly detailed visuals from textual descriptions. However, these models may inadvertently generate inappropriate content, such as copyrighted works or offensive images. While existing methods attempt to eliminate specific unwanted concepts, they often fail to ensure complete removal, allowing the concept to reappear in subtle forms. For instance, a model may successfully avoid generating images in Van Gogh's style when explicitly prompted with 'Van Gogh', yet still reproduce his signature artwork when given the prompt 'Starry Night'. In this paper, we propose SAFER, a novel and efficient approach for thoroughly removing target concepts from diffusion models. At a high level, SAFER is inspired by the observed low-dimensional structure of the text embedding space. The method first identifies a concept-specific subspace $S_c$ associated with the target concept c. It then projects the prompt embeddings onto the complementary subspace of $S_c$, effectively erasing the concept from the generated images. Since concepts can be abstract and difficult to fully capture using natural language alone, we employ textual inversion to learn an optimized embedding of the target concept from a reference image. This enables more precise subspace estimation and enhances removal performance. Furthermore, we introduce a subspace expansion strategy to ensure comprehensive and robust concept erasure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAFER consistently and effectively erases unwanted concepts from diffusion models while preserving generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Automated Harmfulness Testing for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16740v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) usually use content moderation to prevent harmful content spread. To evaluate the robustness of content moderation, several metamorphic testing techniques have been proposed to test content moderation software. However, these techniques mainly focus on general users (e.g., text and image generation). Meanwhile, a recent study shows that developers consider using harmful keywords when naming software artifacts to be an unethical behavior. Exposure to harmful content in software artifacts can negatively impact the mental health of developers, making content moderation for Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) essential. We conduct a preliminary study on program transformations that can be misused to introduce harmful content into auto-generated code, identifying 32 such transformations. To address this, we propose CHT, a coverage-guided harmfulness testing framework that generates prompts using diverse transformations and harmful keywords injected into benign programs. CHT evaluates output damage to assess potential risks in LLM-generated explanations and code. Our evaluation of four Code LLMs and GPT-4o-mini reveals that content moderation in LLM-based code generation is easily bypassed. To enhance moderation, we propose a two-phase approach that first detects harmful content before generating output, improving moderation effectiveness by 483.76\%.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the quadratic scaling properties of the attention in DiTs hinder image generation with higher resolution or on devices with limited resources. This work introduces an efficient diffusion transformer (EDiT) to alleviate these efficiency bottlenecks in conventional DiTs and Multimodal DiTs (MM-DiTs). First, we present a novel linear compressed attention method that uses a multi-layer convolutional network to modulate queries with local information while keys and values are spatially aggregated. Second, we formulate a hybrid attention scheme for multi-modal inputs that combines linear attention for image-to-image interactions and standard scaled dot-product attention for interactions involving prompts. Merging these two approaches leads to an expressive, linear-time Multimodal Efficient Diffusion Transformer (MM-EDiT). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EDiT and MM-EDiT architectures by integrating them into PixArt-Sigma(conventional DiT) and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Medium (MM-DiT), achieving up to 2.2x speedup with comparable image quality after distillation.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike conventional methods that serialize images into fixed-position latent codes with a uniform compression ratio, we introduce an unordered token set representation to dynamically allocate coding capacity based on regional semantic complexity. This TokenSet enhances global context aggregation and improves robustness against local perturbations. To address the critical challenge of modeling discrete sets, we devise a dual transformation mechanism that bijectively converts sets into fixed-length integer sequences with summation constraints. Further, we propose Fixed-Sum Discrete Diffusion--the first framework to simultaneously handle discrete values, fixed sequence length, and summation invariance--enabling effective set distribution modeling. Experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in semantic-aware representation and generation quality. Our innovations, spanning novel representation and modeling strategies, advance visual generation beyond traditional sequential token paradigms.

We propose SynCity, a training- and optimization-free approach, which leverages the geometric precision of pre-trained 3D generative models and the artistic versatility of 2D image generators to create large, high-quality 3D spaces. While most 3D generative models are object-centric and cannot generate large-scale worlds, we show how 3D and 2D generators can be combined to generate ever-expanding scenes. Through a tile-based approach, we allow fine-grained control over the layout and the appearance of scenes. The world is generated tile-by-tile, and each new tile is generated within its world-context and then fused with the scene. SynCity generates compelling and immersive scenes that are rich in detail and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.paulengstler.com/syncity/</p></details> | None |

We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bytedance.github.io/InfiniteYou/ Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/InfiniteYou</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/bytedance/InfiniteYou) |

In this work, we propose VerbDiff to address the challenge of capturing nuanced interactions within text-to-image diffusion models. VerbDiff is a novel text-to-image generation model that weakens the bias between interaction words and objects, enhancing the understanding of interactions. Specifically, we disentangle various interaction words from frequency-based anchor words and leverage localized interaction regions from generated images to help the model better capture semantics in distinctive words without extra conditions. Our approach enables the model to accurately understand the intended interaction between humans and objects, producing high-quality images with accurate interactions aligned with specified verbs.

However, acquiring sufficient data is often challenging and costly. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in high-quality image synthesis and advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel framework called LLM-assisted Paired Image Generation (LaPIG). This framework enables the construction of comprehensive, high-quality paired visible and thermal images using captions generated by LLMs. Our method encompasses three parts: visible image synthesis with ArcFace embedding, thermal image translation using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), and caption generation with LLMs. Our approach not only generates multi-view paired visible and thermal images to increase data diversity but also produces high-quality paired data while maintaining their identity information. We evaluate our method on public datasets by comparing it with existing methods, demonstrating the superiority of LaPIG.</p></details> |  | None |

However, training models for high-resolution image generation remains challenging, particularly when training data and computational resources are limited. In this paper, we explore this practical problem from two key perspectives: data and parameter efficiency, and propose a set of key guidelines for ultra-resolution adaptation termed \emph{URAE}. For data efficiency, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that synthetic data generated by some teacher models can significantly promote training convergence. For parameter efficiency, we find that tuning minor components of the weight matrices outperforms widely-used low-rank adapters when synthetic data are unavailable, offering substantial performance gains while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, for models leveraging guidance distillation, such as FLUX, we show that disabling classifier-free guidance, \textit{i.e.}, setting the guidance scale to 1 during adaptation, is crucial for satisfactory performance. Extensive experiments validate that URAE achieves comparable 2K-generation performance to state-of-the-art closed-source models like FLUX1.1 [Pro] Ultra with only 3K samples and 2K iterations, while setting new benchmarks for 4K-resolution generation.

Recent Unified Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between both paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction, which requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a significant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL framework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our Contrastive objective, "Echo Contrast", leverages the generative capabilities of Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations during training. Sorcen "generates" an echo sample in the semantic token space, forming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on precomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation during training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the previous Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear probing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen surpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA performance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant improvements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available in https://github.com/ImaGonEs/Sorcen</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ImaGonEs/Sorcen) |

However, applying these approaches to images requires discretizing continuous pixel data through vector quantization methods like VQ-VAE. To alleviate the quantization errors that existed in VQ-VAE, recent works tend to use larger codebooks. However, this will accordingly expand vocabulary size, complicating the autoregressive modeling task. This paper aims to find a way to enjoy the benefits of large codebooks without making autoregressive modeling more difficult. Through empirical investigation, we discover that tokens with similar codeword representations produce similar effects on the final generated image, revealing significant redundancy in large codebooks. Based on this insight, we propose to predict tokens from coarse to fine (CTF), realized by assigning the same coarse label for similar tokens. Our framework consists of two stages: (1) an autoregressive model that sequentially predicts coarse labels for each token in the sequence, and (2) an auxiliary model that simultaneously predicts fine-grained labels for all tokens conditioned on their coarse labels. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate our method's superior performance, achieving an average improvement of 59 points in Inception Score compared to baselines. Notably, despite adding an inference step, our approach achieves faster sampling speeds.</p></details> | Work in progress | None |

However, the fundamental reliance of self-attention layers on positional embedding versus query-key similarity during generation remains an intriguing question. We present the first mechanistic analysis of RoPE-based MMDiT models (e.g., FLUX), introducing an automated probing strategy that disentangles positional information versus content dependencies by strategically manipulating RoPE during generation. Our analysis reveals distinct dependency patterns that do not straightforwardly correlate with depth, offering new insights into the layer-specific roles in RoPE-based MMDiT. Based on these findings, we propose a training-free, task-specific image editing framework that categorizes editing tasks into three types: position-dependent editing (e.g., object addition), content similarity-dependent editing (e.g., non-rigid editing), and region-preserved editing (e.g., background replacement). For each type, we design tailored key-value injection strategies based on the characteristics of the editing task. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in preserving original semantic content and achieving seamless modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wtybest.github.io/projects/FreeFlux/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wtybest.github.io/projects) |

However, in the remote sensing field, there is still a lack of research on large-scale text-to-image (text2image) generation technology. Existing remote sensing image-text datasets are small in scale and confined to specific geographic areas and scene types. Besides, existing text2image methods have struggled to achieve global-scale, multi-resolution controllable, and unbounded image generation. To address these challenges, this paper presents two key contributions: the Git-10M dataset and the Text2Earth foundation model. Git-10M is a global-scale image-text dataset comprising 10.5 million image-text pairs, 5 times larger than the previous largest one. The dataset covers a wide range of geographic scenes and contains resolution information, significantly surpassing existing datasets in both size and diversity. Building on Git-10M, we propose Text2Earth, a 1.3 billion parameter generative foundation model based on the diffusion framework to model global-scale remote sensing scenes. Text2Earth integrates a resolution guidance mechanism, enabling users to specify image resolutions. A dynamic condition adaptation strategy is proposed for training and inference to improve image quality. Text2Earth excels in zero-shot text2image generation and demonstrates robust generalization and flexibility across multiple tasks, including unbounded scene construction, image editing, and cross-modal image generation. This robust capability surpasses previous models restricted to the basic fixed size and limited scene types. On the previous benchmark dataset, Text2Earth outperforms previous models with an improvement of +26.23 FID and +20.95% Zero-shot Cls-OA metric.Our project page is https://chen-yang-liu.github.io/Text2Earth</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://chen-yang-liu.github.io/Text2Earth) |

Promptus emerges as a new paradigm for video streaming, substantially cutting down the bandwidth essential for video streaming. However, Promptus is computationally intensive and can not run in real-time on mobile devices. This paper presents PromptMobile, an efficient acceleration framework tailored for on-device Promptus. Specifically, we propose (1) a two-stage efficient generation framework to reduce computational cost by 8.1x, (2) a fine-grained inter-frame caching to reduce redundant computations by 16.6\%, (3) system-level optimizations to further enhance efficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that compared with the original Promptus, PromptMobile achieves a 13.6x increase in image generation speed.

We start by adapting an existing next-scale prediction autoregressive (AR) architecture to T2I generation, investigating and mitigating training stability issues in the process. Next, we argue that scale-wise transformers do not require causality and propose a non-causal counterpart facilitating ~21% faster sampling and lower memory usage while also achieving slightly better generation quality. Furthermore, we reveal that classifier-free guidance at high-resolution scales is often unnecessary and can even degrade performance. By disabling guidance at these scales, we achieve an additional sampling acceleration of ~32% and improve the generation of fine-grained details. Extensive human preference studies and automated evaluations show that Switti outperforms existing T2I AR models and competes with state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models while being up to 7x faster.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

Humans, on the other hand, can often rely on their knowledge and experience to fill in the gaps. For example, the simple task of organizing newly bought produce into the fridge involves deciding where to put each thing individually, how to arrange them together meaningfully, e.g. putting related things together, all while there is no clear right and wrong way to accomplish this task. We could encode all this information on how to do such things explicitly into the robots' knowledge base, but this can quickly become overwhelming, considering the number of potential tasks and circumstances the robot could encounter. However, images of the real world often implicitly encode answers to such questions and can show which configurations of objects are meaningful or are usually used by humans. An image of a full fridge can give a lot of information about how things are usually arranged in relation to each other and the full fridge at large. Modern generative systems are capable of generating plausible images of the real world and can be conditioned on the environment in which the robot operates. Here we investigate the idea of using the implicit knowledge about the world of modern generative AI systems given by their ability to generate convincing images of the real world to solve under-specified tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures | None |

A common approach to personalization is concept learning, which can integrate the subject into existing models relatively quickly, but produces images whose quality tends to deteriorate quickly when the number of subject images is small. Quality can be improved by pre-training an encoder, but training restricts generation to the training distribution, and is time consuming. It is still an open hard challenge to personalize image generation and editing from a single image without training. Here, we present SISO, a novel, training-free approach based on optimizing a similarity score with an input subject image. More specifically, SISO iteratively generates images and optimizes the model based on loss of similarity with the given subject image until a satisfactory level of similarity is achieved, allowing plug-and-play optimization to any image generator. We evaluated SISO in two tasks, image editing and image generation, using a diverse data set of personal subjects, and demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in image quality, subject fidelity, and background preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is at https://siso-paper.github.io/</p></details> | None |

As research in multimodal stimuli and neuroscience advances, fMRI-based brain decoding has become a key tool for understanding brain perception and its complex cognitive processes. Decoding brain signals to reconstruct stimuli not only reveals intricate neural mechanisms but also drives progress in AI, disease treatment, and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and image generation models have significantly improved fMRI-based decoding. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution for precise brain activity mapping, its low temporal resolution and signal noise pose challenges. Meanwhile, techniques like GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models have enhanced reconstructed image quality, and multimodal pre-trained models have boosted cross-modal decoding tasks. This survey systematically reviews recent progress in fMRI-based brain decoding, focusing on stimulus reconstruction from passive brain signals.

Further, since the DNN behavior cannot be assessed through code inspection and analysis, test automation has become an essential activity to gain confidence in the reliability of DNNs. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art automated testing solutions largely rely on simulators, whose fidelity is always imperfect, thus affecting the validity of test results. To address such limitations, we propose to combine meta-heuristic search, used to explore the input space using simulators, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to transform the data generated by simulators into realistic input images. Such images can be used both to assess the DNN performance and to retrain the DNN more effectively. We applied our approach to a state-of-the-art DNN performing semantic segmentation and demonstrated that it outperforms a state-of-the-art GAN-based testing solution and several baselines. Specifically, it leads to the largest number of diverse images leading to the worst DNN performance. Further, the images generated with our approach, lead to the highest improvement in DNN performance when used for retraining. In conclusion, we suggest to always integrate GAN components when performing search-driven, simulator-based testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |

While cross-attention has been well-studied in text-to-image tasks, their interpretability in image-to-image (I2I) diffusion models remains underexplored. This paper introduces Image-to-Image Attribution Maps (I2AM), a method that enhances the interpretability of I2I models by visualizing bidirectional attribution maps, from the reference image to the generated image and vice versa. I2AM aggregates cross-attention scores across time steps, attention heads, and layers, offering insights into how critical features are transferred between images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of I2AM across object detection, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our results demonstrate that I2AM successfully identifies key regions responsible for generating the output, even in complex scenes. Additionally, we introduce the Inpainting Mask Attention Consistency Score (IMACS) as a novel evaluation metric to assess the alignment between attribution maps and inpainting masks, which correlates strongly with existing performance metrics. Through extensive experiments, we show that I2AM enables model debugging and refinement, providing practical tools for improving I2I model's performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 23 pages | None |

To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel and highly generalizable framework for DeepFake detection that not only determines whether an image is real or fake but also provides detailed textual reasoning for its predictions. Unlike traditional methods, TruthLens effectively handles both face-manipulated DeepFakes and fully AI-generated content while addressing fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?" The architecture of TruthLens combines the global contextual understanding of multimodal large language models like PaliGemma2 with the localized feature extraction capabilities of vision-only models like DINOv2. This hybrid design leverages the complementary strengths of both models, enabling robust detection of subtle manipulations while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy (by 2-14%) and explainability, in both in-domain and cross-data settings, generalizing effectively across traditional and emerging manipulation techniques.</p></details> |  | None |
