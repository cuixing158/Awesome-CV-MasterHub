| **[Mogao: An Omni Foundation Model for Interleaved Multi-Modal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05472v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in unified models for image understanding and generation has been impressive, yet most approaches remain limited to single-modal generation conditioned on multiple modalities. In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mogao...</summary><p>Mogao Technical Report</p></details> | None |

Our method employs a Schroedinger bridge to transform the noisy speech distribution into the clean speech distribution. To stabilize and improve training, we employ time-dependent scalings of the inputs and outputs of the network, known as preconditioning. We consider two skip connection configurations, which either include or omit the current process state in the denoiser's output, enabling the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. Each approach leads to improved performance on different speech enhancement metrics. To maintain stable magnitude levels and balance during training, we use a magnitude-preserving network architecture that normalizes all activations and network weights to unit length. Additionally, we propose learning the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for effective input conditioning. After training, we apply a method to approximate different exponential moving average (EMA) profiles and investigate their effects on the speech enhancement performance. In contrast to image generation tasks, where longer EMA lengths often enhance mode coverage, we observe that shorter EMA lengths consistently lead to better performance on standard speech enhancement metrics. Code, audio examples, and checkpoints are available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WASPAA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[PIDiff: Image Customization for Personalized Identities with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05081v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation for personalized identities aims at incorporating the specific identity into images using a text prompt and an identity image. Based on the powerful generative capabilities of DDPMs, many previous works adopt additional prompts, such as text embeddings and CLIP image embeddings, to represent the identity information, while they fail to disentangle the identity information and background information. As a result, the generated images not only lose key identity characteristics but also suffer from significantly reduced diversity. To address this issue, previous works have combined the W+ space from StyleGAN with diffusion models, leveraging this space to provide a more accurate and comprehensive representation of identity features through multi-level feature extraction. However, the entanglement of identity and background information in in-the-wild images during training prevents accurate identity localization, resulting in severe semantic interference between identity and background. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning-based diffusion model for personalized identities text-to-image generation, named PIDiff, which leverages the W+ space and an identity-tailored fine-tuning strategy to avoid semantic entanglement and achieves accurate feature extraction and localization. Style editing can also be achieved by PIDiff through preserving the characteristics of identity features in the W+ space, which vary from coarse to fine. Through the combination of the proposed cross-attention block and parameter optimization strategy, PIDiff preserves the identity information and maintains the generation capability for in-the-wild images of the pre-trained model during inference. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in this task.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[SceneCraft: Layout-Guided 3D Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09049v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The creation of complex 3D scenes tailored to user specifications has been a tedious and challenging task with traditional 3D modeling tools. Although some pioneering methods have achieved automatic text-to-3D generation, they are generally limited to small-scale scenes with restricted control over the shape and texture. We introduce SceneCraft, a novel method for generating detailed indoor scenes that adhere to textual descriptions and spatial layout preferences provided by users. Central to our method is a rendering-based technique, which converts 3D semantic layouts into multi-view 2D proxy maps. Furthermore, we design a semantic and depth conditioned diffusion model to generate multi-view images, which are used to learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the final scene representation. Without the constraints of panorama image generation, we surpass previous methods in supporting complicated indoor space generation beyond a single room, even as complicated as a whole multi-bedroom apartment with irregular shapes and layouts. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in complex indoor scene generation with diverse textures, consistent geometry, and realistic visual quality.

| **[Mixture-of-Transformers: A Sparse and Scalable Architecture for Multi-Modal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04996v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has expanded to multi-modal systems capable of processing text, images, and speech within a unified framework. Training these models demands significantly larger datasets and computational resources compared to text-only LLMs. To address the scaling challenges, we introduce Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a sparse multi-modal transformer architecture that significantly reduces pretraining computational costs. MoT decouples non-embedding parameters of the model by modality -- including feed-forward networks, attention matrices, and layer normalization -- enabling modality-specific processing with global self-attention over the full input sequence. We evaluate MoT across multiple settings and model scales. In the Chameleon 7B setting (autoregressive text-and-image generation), MoT matches the dense baseline's performance using only 55.8\% of the FLOPs. When extended to include speech, MoT reaches speech performance comparable to the dense baseline with only 37.2\% of the FLOPs. In the Transfusion setting, where text and image are trained with different objectives, a 7B MoT model matches the image modality performance of the dense baseline with one third of the FLOPs, and a 760M MoT model outperforms a 1.4B dense baseline across key image generation metrics. System profiling further highlights MoT's practical benefits, achieving dense baseline image quality in 47.2\% of the wall-clock time and text quality in 75.6\% of the wall-clock time (measured on AWS p4de.24xlarge instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2025; 48 pages</p></details> | None |
| **[CRAFT: Cultural Russian-Oriented Dataset Adaptation for Focused Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04851v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the fact that popular text-to-image generation models cope well with international and general cultural queries, they have a significant knowledge gap regarding individual cultures. This is due to the content of existing large training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is arxiv version of the paper which was accepted for the Doklady Mathematics Journal in 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[On Synthetic Texture Datasets: Challenges, Creation, and Curation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10297v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of textures on machine learning models has been an ongoing investigation, specifically in texture bias/learning, interpretability, and robustness. However, due to the lack of large and diverse texture data available, the findings in these works have been limited, as more comprehensive evaluations have not been feasible. Image generative models are able to provide data creation at scale, but utilizing these models for texture synthesis has been unexplored and poses additional challenges both in creating accurate texture images and validating those images. In this work, we introduce an extensible methodology and corresponding new dataset for generating high-quality, diverse texture images capable of supporting a broad set of texture-based tasks. Our pipeline consists of: (1) developing prompts from a range of descriptors to serve as input to text-to-image models, (2) adopting and adapting Stable Diffusion pipelines to generate and filter the corresponding images, and (3) further filtering down to the highest quality images. Through this, we create the Prompted Textures Dataset (PTD), a dataset of 362,880 texture images that span 56 textures. During the process of generating images, we find that NSFW safety filters in image generation pipelines are highly sensitive to texture (and flag up to 60\% of our texture images), uncovering a potential bias in these models and presenting unique challenges when working with texture data. Through both standard metrics and a human evaluation, we find that our dataset is high quality and diverse. Our dataset is available for download at https://zenodo.org/records/15359142.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lay-Your-Scene: Natural Scene Layout Generation with Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04718v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Lay-Your-Scene (shorthand LayouSyn), a novel text-to-layout generation pipeline for natural scenes. Prior scene layout generation methods are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn in image editing applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficiency Meets Fidelity: A Novel Quantization Framework for Stable Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06661v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation via Stable Diffusion models (SDM) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, their computational intensity, particularly in the iterative denoising process, hinders real-time deployment in latency-sensitive applications. While Recent studies have explored post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods to compress Diffusion models, existing methods often overlook the consistency between results generated by quantized models and those from floating-point models. This consistency is paramount for professional applications where both efficiency and output reliability are essential. To ensure that quantized SDM generates high-quality and consistent images, we propose an efficient quantization framework for SDM. Our framework introduces a Serial-to-Parallel pipeline that simultaneously maintains training-inference consistency and ensures optimization stability. Building upon this foundation, we further develop several techniques including multi-timestep activation quantization, time information precalculation, inter-layer distillation, and selective freezing, to achieve high-fidelity generation in comparison to floating-point models while maintaining quantization efficiency. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple Stable Diffusion variants (v1-4, v2-1, XL 1.0, and v3), our method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches with shorter training times. Under W4A8 quantization settings, we achieve significant improvements in both distribution similarity and visual fidelity, while preserving a high image quality.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we study creativity from a practical perspective and introduce quantitative measures that help the user to choose a suitable AI model for a given task. We evaluated our measures on a number of popular image-to-image generation models, and the results of this suggest that our measures conform to human intuition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Flow Matching using Latent Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04486v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. Building upon the ideas of continuous normalizing flows, flow matching models generalize the transport path of the diffusion models from a simple prior distribution to the data. Most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying structure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating manifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often require expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we present \texttt{Latent-CFM}, which provides simplified training/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal synthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that \texttt{Latent-CFM} exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training ($\sim 50\%$ less in some cases) and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Training-Free Sketch-Guided Diffusion with Latent Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00313v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Based on recent advanced diffusion models, Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have demonstrated their capabilities to generate diverse and high-quality images. However, leveraging their potential for real-world content creation, particularly in providing users with precise control over the image generation result, poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an innovative training-free pipeline that extends existing text-to-image generation models to incorporate a sketch as an additional condition. To generate new images with a layout and structure closely resembling the input sketch, we find that these core features of a sketch can be tracked with the cross-attention maps of diffusion models. We introduce latent optimization, a method that refines the noisy latent at each intermediate step of the generation process using cross-attention maps to ensure that the generated images adhere closely to the desired structure outlined in the reference sketch. Through latent optimization, our method enhances the accuracy of image generation, offering users greater control and customization options in content creation.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Through preliminary testing on platforms such as ChatGPT, MetaAI, and Grok, we observed that even short, natural prompts could lead to the generation of compromising images ranging from realistic depictions of forged documents to manipulated images of public figures. We introduce Unmasking the Canvas (UTC Benchmark; UTCB), a dynamic and scalable benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM vulnerability in image generation. Our methodology combines structured prompt engineering, multilingual obfuscation (e.g., Zulu, Gaelic, Base64), and evaluation using Groq-hosted LLaMA-3. The pipeline supports both zero-shot and fallback prompting strategies, risk scoring, and automated tagging. All generations are stored with rich metadata and curated into Bronze (non-verified), Silver (LLM-aided verification), and Gold (manually verified) tiers. UTCB is designed to evolve over time with new data sources, prompt templates, and model behaviors. Warning: This paper includes visual examples of adversarial inputs designed to test model safety.

| **[Re-ReST: Reflection-Reinforced Self-Training for Language Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01495v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finetuning language agents with reasoning-action trajectories is effective, but obtaining these trajectories from human annotations or stronger models is costly and sometimes impractical. In this paper, we investigate the use of self-training in language agents, which can generate supervision from the agent itself, offering a promising alternative without relying on human or stronger model demonstrations. Self-training, however, requires high-quality model-generated samples, which are hard to obtain for challenging language agent tasks. To address this, we present Reflection-Reinforced Self-Training (Re-ReST), which uses a \textit{reflector} to refine low-quality generated samples during self-training. The reflector takes the agent's output and feedback from an external environment (e.g., unit test results in code generation) to produce improved samples. This technique enhances the quality of inferior samples and efficiently enriches the self-training dataset with higher-quality samples. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source language agents across tasks, including multi-hop question answering, sequential decision-making, code generation, visual question answering, and text-to-image generation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-training and Re-ReST in language agent tasks, with self-training improving baselines by 7.6\% on HotpotQA and 28.4\% on AlfWorld, and Re-ReST further boosting performance by 2.0\% and 14.1\%, respectively. Our studies also confirm the efficiency of using a reflector to generate high-quality samples for self-training. Moreover, we demonstrate a method to employ reflection during inference without ground-truth feedback, addressing the limitation of previous reflection work. Our code is released at https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/Re-ReST.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/Re-ReST) |
| **[RFNNS: Robust Fixed Neural Network Steganography with Popular Deep Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04116v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image steganography is a technique that conceals secret information in a cover image to achieve covert communication. Recent research has demonstrated that Fixed Neural Network Steganography (FNNS) exhibits significant practical advantages, as it enables stable and efficient steganographic embedding and extraction without requiring neural network training. However, the stego image generated by existing FNNS methods suffers from considerable distortion and exhibits poor robustness, severely reducing the security and practicality of steganography. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Robust Fixed Neural Network Steganography (RFNNS). In RFNNS, we introduce a texture-aware localization technique to add perturbations carrying secret image information to complex texture areas that are less perceptible to the human eye, thereby ensuring the quality of the stego image. To enhance robustness, a robust steganographic perturbation generation (RSPG) strategy is designed, which enables slight perturbations to be accurately decoded even after common image attacks. Subsequently, the generated robust perturbations are combined with the AI-generated cover image to produce the stego image. The receiver only needs to share the secret key and employ the same decoding network structure to accurately extract the secret image from the attacked stego image. Experimental results demonstrate that RFNNS achieves enhanced performance in terms of security, including imperceptibility and anti-steganalysis performance. Furthermore, RFNNS demonstrates superior robustness against common image attacks, such as JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and contrast adjustment, across diverse embedding capacities, outperforming existing SOTA FNNS methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DynamicControl: Adaptive Condition Selection for Improved Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03255v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multimodal Benchmarking and Recommendation of Text-to-Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04650v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an open-source unified benchmarking and evaluation framework for text-to-image generation models, with a particular focus on the impact of metadata augmented prompts. Leveraging the DeepFashion-MultiModal dataset, we assess generated outputs through a comprehensive set of quantitative metrics, including Weighted Score, CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pre-training)-based similarity, LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), FID (Frechet Inception Distance), and retrieval-based measures, as well as qualitative analysis. Our results demonstrate that structured metadata enrichments greatly enhance visual realism, semantic fidelity, and model robustness across diverse text-to-image architectures. While not a traditional recommender system, our framework enables task-specific recommendations for model selection and prompt design based on evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, T2I models introduce risks such as the generation of non-consensual depictions of identifiable individuals, otherwise known as deepfakes. This paper presents an empirical study exploring the accessibility of deepfake model variants online. Through a metadata analysis of thousands of publicly downloadable model variants on two popular repositories, Hugging Face and Civitai, we demonstrate a huge rise in easily accessible deepfake models. Almost 35,000 examples of publicly downloadable deepfake model variants are identified, primarily hosted on Civitai. These deepfake models have been downloaded almost 15 million times since November 2022, with the models targeting a range of individuals from global celebrities to Instagram users with under 10,000 followers. Both Stable Diffusion and Flux models are used for the creation of deepfake models, with 96% of these targeting women and many signalling intent to generate non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). Deepfake model variants are often created via the parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as low rank adaptation (LoRA), requiring as few as 20 images, 24GB VRAM, and 15 minutes of time, making this process widely accessible via consumer-grade computers. Despite these models violating the Terms of Service of hosting platforms, and regulation seeking to prevent dissemination, these results emphasise the pressing need for greater action to be taken against the creation of deepfakes and NCII.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

However, given a long paragraph (up to 512 words), these generation models still struggle to achieve strong alignment and are unable to generate images depicting complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce an information-enriched diffusion model for paragraph-to-image generation task, termed ParaDiffusion, which delves into the transference of the extensive semantic comprehension capabilities of large language models to the task of image generation. At its core is using a large language model (e.g., Llama V2) to encode long-form text, followed by fine-tuning with LORA to alignthe text-image feature spaces in the generation task. To facilitate the training of long-text semantic alignment, we also curated a high-quality paragraph-image pair dataset, namely ParaImage. This dataset contains a small amount of high-quality, meticulously annotated data, and a large-scale synthetic dataset with long text descriptions being generated using a vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate that ParaDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art models (SD XL, DeepFloyd IF) on ViLG-300 and ParaPrompts, achieving up to 15% and 45% human voting rate improvements for visual appeal and text faithfulness, respectively. The code and dataset will be released to foster community research on long-text alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project website is at: https://weijiawu.github.io/ParaDiffusionPage/.

However, the spatial misalignment between FA maps and tractography atlases hinders their effective integration into predictive models. To address this issue, we propose a CycleGAN based approach for generating FA maps directly from T1-weighted MRI scans, representing the first application of this technique to both healthy and tumour-affected tissues. Our model, trained on unpaired data, produces high fidelity maps, which have been rigorously evaluated using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), demonstrating particularly robust performance in tumour regions. Radiological assessments further underscore the model's potential to enhance clinical workflows by providing an AI-driven alternative that reduces the necessity for additional scans.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

However, because these models are trained on images from diverse sources, they risk memorizing and reproducing specific content, raising concerns about intellectual property (IP) infringement. Recent advances in prompt engineering offer a cost-effective way to enhance generative AI performance. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques in mitigating IP infringement risks in image generation. Our findings show that Chain of Thought Prompting and Task Instruction Prompting significantly reduce the similarity between generated images and the training data of diffusion models, thereby lowering the risk of IP infringement.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reward Model through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03318v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal Reward Models (RMs) have shown significant promise in delivering reward signals to align vision models with human preferences. However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o, which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision reward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/think</p></details> | [Code Link](https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward) |
| **[Regression is all you need for medical image translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02048v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The acquisition of information-rich images within a limited time budget is crucial in medical imaging. Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits - creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact, the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel 2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore, we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality. Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods. Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the practical application of MIT in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Spaceborn to Airborn: SAR Image Synthesis Using Foundation Models for Multi-Scale Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03844v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery has increased considerably in recent years, with datasets commercially available. However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Dataset Copyright Evasion Attack against Personalized Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02824v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling high-quality image generation conditioned on textual prompts. However, the growing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises serious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset ownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks into the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks remain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when triggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we explore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models to circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose the first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to undermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three stages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient watermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models exhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning, evident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can reliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens from the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in intermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens. Finally, we adopt a closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermark. Extensive experiments show that our CEAT2I effectively evades DOV mechanisms while preserving model performance.</p></details> |  | None |

While considerable research has focused on federated image generation, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders have received less attention. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-IID (independently and identically distributed) data environments featuring multiple groups of images of different types. Non-IID data distributions can lead to difficulties in maintaining a consistent latent space and can also result in local generators with disparate texture features being blended during aggregation. We thereby introduce FissionVAE that decouples the latent space and constructs decoder branches tailored to individual client groups. This method allows for customized learning that aligns with the unique data distributions of each group. Additionally, we incorporate hierarchical VAEs and demonstrate the use of heterogeneous decoder architectures within FissionVAE. We also explore strategies for setting the latent prior distributions to enhance the decoupling process. To evaluate our approach, we assemble two composite datasets: the first combines MNIST and FashionMNIST; the second comprises RGB datasets of cartoon and human faces, wild animals, marine vessels, and remote sensing images. Our experiments demonstrate that FissionVAE greatly improves generation quality on these datasets compared to baseline federated VAE models.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, existing methods often suffer from performance bottlenecks when handling complex prompts that involve multiple objects, characteristics, and relations. Therefore, we propose a Multi-agent Collaboration-based Compositional Diffusion (MCCD) for text-to-image generation for complex scenes. Specifically, we design a multi-agent collaboration-based scene parsing module that generates an agent system comprising multiple agents with distinct tasks, utilizing MLLMs to extract various scene elements effectively. In addition, Hierarchical Compositional diffusion utilizes a Gaussian mask and filtering to refine bounding box regions and enhance objects through region enhancement, resulting in the accurate and high-fidelity generation of complex scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MCCD significantly improves the performance of the baseline models in a training-free manner, providing a substantial advantage in complex scene generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey.

In the past few years, T2I has attracted widespread attention and numerous works have emerged. In this survey, we comprehensively review 141 works conducted from 2021 to 2024. First, we introduce four foundation model architectures of T2I (autoregression, non-autoregression, GAN and diffusion) and the commonly used key technologies (autoencoder, attention and classifier-free guidance). Secondly, we systematically compare the methods of these studies in two directions, T2I generation and T2I editing, including the encoders and the key technologies they use. In addition, we also compare the performance of these researches side by side in terms of datasets, evaluation metrics, training resources, and inference speed. In addition to the four foundation models, we survey other works on T2I, such as energy-based models and recent Mamba and multimodality. We also investigate the potential social impact of T2I and provide some solutions. Finally, we propose unique insights of improving the performance of T2I models and possible future development directions. In summary, this survey is the first systematic and comprehensive overview of T2I, aiming to provide a valuable guide for future researchers and stimulate continued progress in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages,3 figures,3 tables</p></details> | None |

Previous studies have unveiled the roles of attention blocks in the U-Net. However, they overlook the dynamic evolution of their importance during the inference process, which hinders their further exploitation to improve image applications. In this study, we first theoretically proved that, re-weighting the outputs of the Transformer blocks within the U-Net is a "free lunch" for improving the signal-to-noise ratio during the sampling process. Next, we proposed Importance Probe to uncover and quantify the dynamic shifts in importance of the Transformer blocks throughout the denoising process. Finally, we design an adaptive importance-based re-weighting schedule tailored to specific image generation and editing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the inference process, and enhances the aesthetic quality of the samples with identity consistency.

We hypothesize that differences between distilled (e.g. FLUX.1-schnell) and baseline (e.g. FLUX.1-dev) models are consistent and, therefore, learnable within a specialized domain, like portrait generation. We generate a synthetic paired dataset and train a fast image-to-image translation head. Using two sets of low- and high-quality synthetic images, our model is trained to refine the output of a distilled generator (e.g., FLUX.1-schnell) to a level comparable to a baseline model like FLUX.1-dev, which is more computationally intensive. Our results show that the pipeline, which combines a distilled version of a large generative model with our enhancement layer, delivers similar photorealistic portraits to the baseline version with up to an 82% decrease in computational cost compared to FLUX.1-dev.

| **[ID-Booth: Identity-consistent Face Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07392v4)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. The source code for the ID-Booth framework is publicly available at https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2025, 14 pages</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth) |

Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits - creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact, the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel 2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore, we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality. Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods. Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the practical application of MIT in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MFCLIP: Multi-modal Fine-grained CLIP for Generalizable Diffusion Face Forgery Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09724v2)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of photo-realistic face generation methods has raised significant concerns in society and academia, highlighting the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection (FFD) techniques. Although existing approaches mainly capture face forgery patterns using image modality, other modalities like fine-grained noises and texts are not fully explored, which limits the generalization capability of the model. In addition, most FFD methods tend to identify facial images generated by GAN, but struggle to detect unseen diffusion-synthesized ones. To address the limitations, we aim to leverage the cutting-edge foundation model, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), to achieve generalizable diffusion face forgery detection (DFFD). In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal fine-grained CLIP (MFCLIP) model, which mines comprehensive and fine-grained forgery traces across image-noise modalities via language-guided face forgery representation learning, to facilitate the advancement of DFFD. Specifically, we devise a fine-grained language encoder (FLE) that extracts fine global language features from hierarchical text prompts. We design a multi-modal vision encoder (MVE) to capture global image forgery embeddings as well as fine-grained noise forgery patterns extracted from the richest patch, and integrate them to mine general visual forgery traces. Moreover, we build an innovative plug-and-play sample pair attention (SPA) method to emphasize relevant negative pairs and suppress irrelevant ones, allowing cross-modality sample pairs to conduct more flexible alignment. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that our model outperforms the state of the arts on different settings like cross-generator, cross-forgery, and cross-dataset evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RAGAR: Retrieval Augment Personalized Image Generation Guided by Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01657v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image generation is crucial for improving the user experience, as it renders reference images into preferred ones according to user visual preferences. Although effective, existing methods face two main issues. First, existing methods treat all items in the user historical sequence equally when extracting user preferences, overlooking the varying semantic similarities between historical items and the reference item. Disproportionately high weights for low-similarity items distort users' visual preferences for the reference item. Second, existing methods heavily rely on consistency between generated and reference images to optimize the generation, which leads to underfitting user preferences and hinders personalization. To address these issues, we propose Retrieval Augment Personalized Image GenerAtion guided by Recommendation (RAGAR). Our approach uses a retrieval mechanism to assign different weights to historical items according to their similarities to the reference item, thereby extracting more refined users' visual preferences for the reference item. Then we introduce a novel rank task based on the multi-modal ranking model to optimize the personalization of the generated images instead of forcing depend on consistency. Extensive experiments and human evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAR achieves significant improvements in both personalization and semantic metrics compared to five baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AMO Sampler: Enhancing Text Rendering with Overshooting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19415v2)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise alignment between textual instructions and generated images in text-to-image generation is a significant challenge, particularly in rendering written text within images. Sate-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text depiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a training-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly enhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting sampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between over-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and reintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler effectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct the compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the text rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe over-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we propose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively controls the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their attention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9% improvement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising overall image quality or increasing inference cost.

To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{WorldGenBench}, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate T2I models' world knowledge grounding and implicit inferential capabilities, covering both the humanities and nature domains. We propose the \textbf{Knowledge Checklist Score}, a structured metric that measures how well generated images satisfy key semantic expectations. Experiments across 21 state-of-the-art models reveal that while diffusion models lead among open-source methods, proprietary auto-regressive models like GPT-4o exhibit significantly stronger reasoning and knowledge integration.

Current editing approaches, primarily designed for single-object modifications, struggle with sequential editing: especially with maintaining previous edits along with adapting new objects naturally into the existing content. These limitations significantly hinder complex editing scenarios where multiple objects need to be modified while preserving their contextual relationships. We address this fundamental challenge through two key proposals: enabling rough mask inputs that preserve existing content while naturally integrating new elements and supporting consistent editing across multiple modifications. Our framework achieves this through layer-wise memory, which stores latent representations and prompt embeddings from previous edits. We propose Background Consistency Guidance that leverages memorized latents to maintain scene coherence and Multi-Query Disentanglement in cross-attention that ensures natural adaptation to existing content. To evaluate our method, we present a new benchmark dataset incorporating semantic alignment metrics and interactive editing scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate superior performance in iterative image editing tasks with minimal user effort, requiring only rough masks while maintaining high-quality results throughout multiple editing steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Recent approaches have further extended these methods with personalization techniques that allow them to integrate user-illustrated concepts (e.g., the user him/herself) using a few sample image illustrations. However, the ability to generate images with multiple interacting concepts, such as human subjects, as well as concepts that may be entangled in one, or across multiple, image illustrations remains illusive. In this work, we propose a concept-driven TTI personalization framework that addresses these core challenges. We build on existing works that learn custom tokens for user-illustrated concepts, allowing those to interact with existing text tokens in the TTI model. However, importantly, to disentangle and better learn the concepts in question, we jointly learn (latent) segmentation masks that disentangle these concepts in user-provided image illustrations. We do so by introducing an Expectation Maximization (EM)-like optimization procedure where we alternate between learning the custom tokens and estimating (latent) masks encompassing corresponding concepts in user-supplied images. We obtain these masks based on cross-attention, from within the U-Net parameterized latent diffusion model and subsequent DenseCRF optimization. We illustrate that such joint alternating refinement leads to the learning of better tokens for concepts and, as a by-product, latent masks. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach qualitatively and quantitatively with several examples and use cases that can combine three or more entangled concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Fi...</summary><p>11 Figures, 14 Pages, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

In computer vision, the attention mechanism was first incorporated in the Vision Transformer ViT, and then its usage has expanded into many tasks in the vision domain, such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and image generation. While the attention mechanism is very expressive and capable, it comes with the disadvantage of being computationally expensive and requiring datasets of considerable size for effective optimization. To address these shortcomings, many designs have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational burden and alleviate the data size requirements. Examples of such attempts in the vision domain are the MLP-Mixer, the Conv-Mixer, the Perciver-IO, and many more attempts with different sets of advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a new computational block as an alternative to the standard ViT block. The newly proposed block reduces the computational requirements by replacing the normal attention layers with a Network in Network structure, therefore enhancing the static approach of the MLP-Mixer with a dynamic learning of element-wise gating function generated by a token mixing process. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed design provides better performance than the baseline architectures on multiple datasets applied in the image classification task of the vision domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Comput & Applic (2025)</p></details> | None |

However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

However, it consumes significant power and faces computation security risks due to the reliance on extensive data centers and servers in the cloud. Reducing power consumption while enhancing computational scale remains persistent challenges in cloud computing. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical cloud computing system that can be seamlessly deployed across edge-metro network. By modulating inputs and models into light, a wide range of edge nodes can directly access the optical computing center via the edge-metro network. The experimental validations show an energy efficiency of 118.6 mW/TOPs (tera operations per second), reducing energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional electronic-based cloud computing solutions. Furthermore, it is experimentally validated that this architecture can perform various complex generative AI models through parallel computing to achieve image generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e., adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional generation.

However, training these two stages separately leads to significant data bias in the inference phase, thus affecting the quality of reconstructed results. We introduce a unified 3D generation framework, named Ouroboros3D, which integrates diffusion-based multi-view image generation and 3D reconstruction into a recursive diffusion process. In our framework, these two modules are jointly trained through a self-conditioning mechanism, allowing them to adapt to each other's characteristics for robust inference. During the multi-view denoising process, the multi-view diffusion model uses the 3D-aware maps rendered by the reconstruction module at the previous timestep as additional conditions. The recursive diffusion framework with 3D-aware feedback unites the entire process and improves geometric consistency.Experiments show that our framework outperforms separation of these two stages and existing methods that combine them at the inference phase.

However, generating high-fidelity personalized images with specific subjects still presents challenges, especially in cases involving multiple subjects. In this paper, we propose AnyStory, a unified approach for personalized subject generation. AnyStory not only achieves high-fidelity personalization for single subjects, but also for multiple subjects, without sacrificing subject fidelity. Specifically, AnyStory models the subject personalization problem in an "encode-then-route" manner. In the encoding step, AnyStory utilizes a universal and powerful image encoder, i.e., ReferenceNet, in conjunction with CLIP vision encoder to achieve high-fidelity encoding of subject features. In the routing step, AnyStory utilizes a decoupled instance-aware subject router to accurately perceive and predict the potential location of the corresponding subject in the latent space, and guide the injection of subject conditions. Detailed experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our method in retaining subject details, aligning text descriptions, and personalizing for multiple subjects.

This technical report presents the first-look evaluation benchmark (named GPT-ImgEval), quantitatively and qualitatively diagnosing GPT-4o's performance across three critical dimensions: (1) generation quality, (2) editing proficiency, and (3) world knowledge-informed semantic synthesis. Across all three tasks, GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both image generation control and output quality, while also showcasing exceptional knowledge reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, based on the GPT-4o's generated data, we propose a classification-model-based approach to investigate the underlying architecture of GPT-4o, where our empirical results suggest the model consists of an auto-regressive (AR) combined with a diffusion-based head for image decoding, rather than the VAR-like architectures. We also provide a complete speculation on GPT-4o's overall architecture. In addition, we conduct a series of analyses to identify and visualize GPT-4o's specific limitations and the synthetic artifacts commonly observed in its image generation. We also present a comparative study of multi-round image editing between GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, and discuss the safety implications of GPT-4o's outputs, particularly their detectability by existing image forensic models. We hope that our work can offer valuable insight and provide a reliable benchmark to guide future research, foster reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in the field of image generation and beyond.

| **[EZIGen: Enhancing zero-shot personalized image generation with precise subject encoding and decoupled guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08091v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot personalized image generation models aim to produce images that align with both a given text prompt and subject image, requiring the model to incorporate both sources of guidance. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained subject details and frequently prioritize one form of guidance over the other, resulting in suboptimal subject encoding and imbalanced generation. In this study, we uncover key insights into overcoming such drawbacks, notably that 1) the choice of the subject image encoder critically influences subject identity preservation and training efficiency, and 2) the text and subject guidance should take effect at different denoising stages. Building on these insights, we introduce a new approach, EZIGen, that employs two main components: leveraging a fixed pre-trained Diffusion UNet itself as subject encoder, following a process that balances the two guidances by separating their dominance stage and revisiting certain time steps to bootstrap subject transfer quality. Through these two components, EZIGen, initially built upon SD2.1-base, achieved state-of-the-art performances on multiple personalized generation benchmarks with a unified model, while using 100 times less training data. Moreover, by further migrating our design to SDXL, EZIGen is proven to be a versatile model-agnostic solution for personalized generation.

Given a reference image, this requires adapting the appearance of a generated 3D asset to reflect the visual style of the reference while maintaining visual consistency from multiple viewpoints. To tackle this problem, we draw inspiration from the success of 2D stylization methods that leverage the attention mechanisms in large image generation models to capture and transfer visual style. In particular, we probe if large reconstruction models, commonly used in the context of 3D generation, has a similar capability. We discover that the certain attention blocks in these models capture the appearance specific features. By injecting features from a visual style image to such blocks, we develop a simple yet effective 3D appearance stylization method. Our method does not require training or test time optimization. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results in terms of 3D appearance stylization, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality visual outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2025</p></details> | None |

When GPT-4o Generation Ushers in Image Compression Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21814v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of AIGC foundation models has revolutionized the paradigm of image compression, which paves the way for the abandonment of most pixel-level transform and coding, compelling us to ask: why compress what you can generate if the AIGC foundation model is powerful enough to faithfully generate intricate structure and fine-grained details from nothing more than some compact descriptors, i.e., texts, or cues. Fortunately, recent GPT-4o image generation of OpenAI has achieved impressive cross-modality generation, editing, and design capabilities, which motivates us to answer the above question by exploring its potential in image compression fields. In this work, we investigate two typical compression paradigms: textual coding and multimodal coding (i.e., text + extremely low-resolution image), where all/most pixel-level information is generated instead of compressing via the advanced GPT-4o image generation function. The essential challenge lies in how to maintain semantic and structure consistency during the decoding process. To overcome this, we propose a structure raster-scan prompt engineering mechanism to transform the image into textual space, which is compressed as the condition of GPT-4o image generation. Extensive experiments have shown that the combination of our designed structural raster-scan prompts and GPT-4o's image generation function achieved the impressive performance compared with recent multimodal/generative image compression at ultra-low bitrate, further indicating the potential of AIGC generation in image compression fields.</p></details> |  | None |

An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.</p></details> |  | None |

Developing algorithms capable of automatically synthesizing vector fonts can significantly facilitate the font design process. However, existing methods mainly concentrate on raster image generation, and only a few approaches can directly synthesize vector fonts. This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable method, VecFontSDF, to reconstruct and synthesize high-quality vector fonts using signed distance functions (SDFs). Specifically, based on the proposed SDF-based implicit shape representation, VecFontSDF learns to model each glyph as shape primitives enclosed by several parabolic curves, which can be precisely converted to quadratic B\'ezier curves that are widely used in vector font products. In this manner, most image generation methods can be easily extended to synthesize vector fonts. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset demonstrate that our method obtains high-quality results on several tasks, including vector font reconstruction, interpolation, and few-shot vector font synthesis, markedly outperforming the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Latent Feature-Guided Conditional Diffusion for High-Fidelity Generative Image Semantic Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21577v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication is proposed and expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of massive data transmission over sixth generation (6G) networks. However, existing deep learning-based joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) image semantic communication scheme predominantly focuses on optimizing pixel-level metrics, and neglects human perceptual requirements, which results in degraded perceptual quality. To address this issue, we propose a latent representation-oriented image semantic communication (LRISC) system, which transmits latent semantic features for image generation with semantic consistency, thereby ensuring the perceptual quality at the receiver. In particular, we first map the source image to latent features in a high-dimensional semantic space via a neural network (NN)- based non-linear transformation. Subsequently, these features are encoded using a joint source and channel coding (JSCC) scheme with adaptive coding length for efficient transmission over a wireless channel. At the receiver, a conditional diffusion model is developed by using the received latent features as conditional guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, progressively reconstructing high-fidelity images while preserving semantic consistency. Moreover, we introduce a channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptation mechanism, allowing one model to work across various channel states. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods, in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) and robustness against channel noise, with an average LPIPS reduction of 43.3% compared to DeepJSCC, while guaranteeing the semantic consistency.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures | None |

As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of $O(N^2)$, compared to $O(N)$ for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs almost no end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

Generating fonts for complex languages like Korean and Chinese, particularly in handwritten styles, presents significant challenges. Traditional AFGs, like Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), are usually unstable during training and often face mode collapse problems. They also struggle to capture fine details within font images. To address these problems, we present a diffusion-based AFG method which generates high-quality, diverse Korean font images using only a single reference image, focusing on handwritten and printed styles. Our approach refines noisy images incrementally, ensuring stable training and visually appealing results. A key innovation is our text encoder, which processes phonetic representations to generate accurate and contextually correct characters, even for unseen characters. We used a pre-trained style encoder from DG FONT to effectively and accurately encode the style images. To further enhance the generation quality, we used perceptual loss that guides the model to focus on the global style of generated images. Experimental results on over 2000 Korean characters demonstrate that our model consistently generates accurate and detailed font images and outperforms benchmark methods, making it a reliable tool for generating authentic Korean fonts across different styles.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, Accepted at ICOIN 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods are limited to providing global quality scores, failing to deliver fine-grained perceptual evaluations for structurally complex subjects like humans, which is a critical challenge considering the frequent anatomical and textural distortions in AI-generated human images (AGHIs). To address this gap, we introduce AGHI-QA, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed for quality assessment of AGHIs. The dataset comprises 4,000 images generated from 400 carefully crafted text prompts using 10 state of-the-art T2I models. We conduct a systematic subjective study to collect multidimensional annotations, including perceptual quality scores, text-image correspondence scores, visible and distorted body part labels. Based on AGHI-QA, we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current T2I methods in generating human images from multiple dimensions. Furthermore, we propose AGHI-Assessor, a novel quality metric that integrates the large multimodal model (LMM) with domain-specific human features for precise quality prediction and identification of visible and distorted body parts in AGHIs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGHI-Assessor showcases state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing IQA methods in multidimensional quality assessment and surpassing leading LMMs in detecting structural distortions in AGHIs.</p></details> |  | None |

The prevailing paradigm has commonly employed self-attention with quadratic computational complexity to handle global spatial relationships in complex images, thereby synthesizing high-fidelity images with coherent visual semantics.Contrary to conventional wisdom, our systematic layer-wise analysis reveals an interesting discrepancy: self-attention in pre-trained diffusion models predominantly exhibits localized attention patterns, closely resembling convolutional inductive biases. This suggests that global interactions in self-attention may be less critical than commonly assumed.Driven by this, we propose \(\Delta\)ConvFusion to replace conventional self-attention modules with Pyramid Convolution Blocks (\(\Delta\)ConvBlocks).By distilling attention patterns into localized convolutional operations while keeping other components frozen, \(\Delta\)ConvFusion achieves performance comparable to transformer-based counterparts while reducing computational cost by 6929$\times$ and surpassing LinFusion by 5.42$\times$ in efficiency--all without compromising generative fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

The malevolent use of synthetic images, such as the dissemination of fake news or the creation of fake profiles, however, raises significant concerns regarding the authenticity of images. Though many forensic algorithms have been developed for detecting synthetic images, their performance, especially the generalization capability, is still far from being adequate to cope with the increasing number of synthetic models. In this work, we propose a simple yet very effective synthetic image detection method via a language-guided contrastive learning. Specifically, we augment the training images with carefully-designed textual labels, enabling us to use a joint visual-language contrastive supervision for learning a forensic feature space with better generalization. It is shown that our proposed LanguAge-guided SynThEsis Detection (LASTED) model achieves much improved generalizability to unseen image generation models and delivers promising performance that far exceeds state-of-the-art competitors over four datasets.

Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 3.5x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.18% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks. With fine-tuning on a turbulence dataset, we show that the method adapts to new settings with more than 40% better accuracy over prior methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In various Text-to-Image or Image-to-Image tasks, attackers can generate a series of images containing inappropriate content by simply editing the language modality input. To mitigate this security concern, numerous guarding or defensive strategies have been proposed, with a particular emphasis on safeguarding language modality. However, in practical applications, threats in the vision modality, particularly in tasks involving the editing of real-world images, present heightened security risks as they can easily infringe upon the rights of the image owner. Therefore, this paper employs a method named typographic attack to reveal that various image generation models are also susceptible to threats within the vision modality. Furthermore, we also evaluate the defense performance of various existing methods when facing threats in the vision modality and uncover their ineffectiveness. Finally, we propose the Vision Modal Threats in Image Generation Models (VMT-IGMs) dataset, which would serve as a baseline for evaluating the vision modality vulnerability of various image generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accept by CVPR2025 (https://cvpr.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/poster/34964)</p></details> | None |

We evaluate Greedy Coordinate Gradients (GCG), PEZ , Random Search, AutoDAN and BLIP2's image captioner across various evaluation metrics related to the quality of inverted prompts and the quality of the images generated by the inverted prompts. We find that focusing on the CLIP similarity between the inverted prompts and the ground truth image acts as a poor proxy for the similarity between ground truth image and the image generated by the inverted prompts. While the discrete optimizers effectively minimize their objectives, simply using responses from a well-trained captioner often leads to generated images that more closely resemble those produced by the original prompts.</p></details> | 11 Pages, 3 Figures | None |

We further build the Efficient Listener Network (ELNet) specially designed to accommodate both the visual and audio information of the speaker as input. Considering of FAD and ELNet, the proposed method learns effective listener facial motion representations and leads to improvements of performance over the state-of-the-art methods while reducing 99% computational time.</p></details> |  | None |

The complexity and the sheer number of available generative techniques, as well as the scarcity of high-quality open source datasets of diverse nature for this task, make training and benchmarking synthetic image source attribution models very challenging. WILD is a new in-the-Wild Image Linkage Dataset designed to provide a powerful training and benchmarking tool for synthetic image attribution models. The dataset is built out of a closed set of 10 popular commercial generators, which constitutes the training base of attribution models, and an open set of 10 additional generators, simulating a real-world in-the-wild scenario. Each generator is represented by 1,000 images, for a total of 10,000 images in the closed set and 10,000 images in the open set. Half of the images are post-processed with a wide range of operators. WILD allows benchmarking attribution models in a wide range of tasks, including closed and open set identification and verification, and robust attribution with respect to post-processing and adversarial attacks. Models trained on WILD are expected to benefit from the challenging scenario represented by the dataset itself. Moreover, an assessment of seven baseline methodologies on closed and open set attribution is presented, including robustness tests with respect to post-processing.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have explored novel attention mechanisms, lightweight architectures, and context-aware modeling, demonstrating impressive performance. However, they often struggle with complex structure (e.g., texture, shape, spatial relations) and semantics (e.g., color consistency, object restoration, and logical correctness), leading to artifacts and inappropriate generation. To address this challenge, we design a simple yet effective inpainting paradigm called latent categories guidance, and further propose a diffusion-based model named PixelHacker. Specifically, we first construct a large dataset containing 14 million image-mask pairs by annotating foreground and background (potential 116 and 21 categories, respectively). Then, we encode potential foreground and background representations separately through two fixed-size embeddings, and intermittently inject these features into the denoising process via linear attention. Finally, by pre-training on our dataset and fine-tuning on open-source benchmarks, we obtain PixelHacker. Extensive experiments show that PixelHacker comprehensively outperforms the SOTA on a wide range of datasets (Places2, CelebA-HQ, and FFHQ) and exhibits remarkable consistency in both structure and semantics.

They often shape our perceptions and expectations of various species. Our study investigates how animal stereotypes manifest in vision-language models during the task of image generation. Through targeted prompts, we explore whether DALL-E perpetuates stereotypical representations of animals, such as "owls as wise," "foxes as unfaithful," etc. Our findings reveal significant stereotyped instances where the model consistently generates images aligned with cultural biases. The current work is the first of its kind to examine animal stereotyping in vision-language models systematically and to highlight a critical yet underexplored dimension of bias in AI-generated visual content.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual-Interrelated Diffusion Model for Few-Shot Anomaly Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13509v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of anomaly inspection in industrial manufacturing is constrained by the scarcity of anomaly data. To overcome this challenge, researchers have started employing anomaly generation approaches to augment the anomaly dataset. However, existing anomaly generation methods suffer from limited diversity in the generated anomalies and struggle to achieve a seamless blending of this anomaly with the original image. Moreover, the generated mask is usually not aligned with the generated anomaly. In this paper, we overcome these challenges from a new perspective, simultaneously generating a pair of the overall image and the corresponding anomaly part. We propose DualAnoDiff, a novel diffusion-based few-shot anomaly image generation model, which can generate diverse and realistic anomaly images by using a dual-interrelated diffusion model, where one of them is employed to generate the whole image while the other one generates the anomaly part. Moreover, we extract background and shape information to mitigate the distortion and blurriness phenomenon in few-shot image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity, realism and the accuracy of mask. Overall, our approach significantly improves the performance of downstream anomaly inspection tasks, including anomaly detection, anomaly localization, and anomaly classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite its practicality, its security analyses have fallen far behind. In this paper, we reveal that this mechanism exacerbates the risk of jailbreak attacks. Different from previous attacks that fuse the unsafe target prompt into one ultimate adversarial prompt, which can be easily detected or may generate non-unsafe images due to under- or over-optimization, we propose Inception, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack against the memory mechanism in real-world text-to-image generation systems. Inception embeds the malice at the inception of the chat session turn by turn, leveraging the mechanism that T2I generation systems retrieve key information in their memory. Specifically, Inception mainly consists of two modules. It first segments the unsafe prompt into chunks, which are subsequently fed to the system in multiple turns, serving as pseudo-gradients for directive optimization. Specifically, we develop a series of segmentation policies that ensure the images generated are semantically consistent with the target prompt. Secondly, after segmentation, to overcome the challenge of the inseparability of minimum unsafe words, we propose recursion, a strategy that makes minimum unsafe words subdivisible. Collectively, segmentation and recursion ensure that all the request prompts are benign but can lead to malicious outcomes. We conduct experiments on the real-world text-to-image generation system ($i.e.$, DALL$\cdot$E 3) to validate the effectiveness of Inception. The results indicate that Inception surpasses the state-of-the-art by a 14\% margin in attack success rate.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Scalable Surrogate Verification of Image-based Neural Network Control Systems using Composition and Unrolling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18554v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-25 | None |

Efficacy of Iterative Human-Driven Prompt Refinement in Image Regeneration Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20340v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With AI-generated content becoming ubiquitous across the web, social media, and other digital platforms, it is vital to examine how such content are inspired and generated. The creation of AI-generated images often involves refining the input prompt iteratively to achieve desired visual outcomes. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored concept of image regeneration using AI, in which a human operator attempts to closely recreate a specific target image by iteratively refining their prompt. Image regeneration is distinct from normal image generation, which lacks any predefined visual reference. A separate challenge lies in determining whether existing image similarity metrics (ISMs) can provide reliable, objective feedback in iterative workflows, given that we do not fully understand if subjective human judgments of similarity align with these metrics. Consequently, we must first validate their alignment with human perception before assessing their potential as a feedback mechanism in the iterative prompt refinement process. To address these research gaps, we present a structured user study evaluating how iterative prompt refinement affects the similarity of regenerated images relative to their targets, while also examining whether ISMs capture the same improvements perceived by human observers. Our findings suggest that incremental prompt adjustments substantially improve alignment, verified through both subjective evaluations and quantitative measures, underscoring the broader potential of iterative workflows to enhance generative AI content creation across various application domains.</p></details> |  | None |

Physics-based simulations are commonly used to address this data scarcity, although they are slow and constrain end-to-end learning. In this work, we explore a new direction for more efficient and end-to-end SAR ship wake simulation using a diffusion model trained on data generated by a physics-based simulator. The training dataset is built by pairing images produced by the simulator with text prompts derived from simulation parameters. Experimental result show that the model generates realistic Kelvin wake patterns and achieves significantly faster inference than the physics-based simulator. These results highlight the potential of diffusion models for fast and controllable wake image generation, opening new possibilities for end-to-end downstream tasks in maritime SAR analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages; Submitted Machine Intelligence for GeoAnalytics and Remote Sensing (MIGARS) - 2025</p></details> | None |

To address these limitations, we start from an naive assumption that text understanding is only a sufficient condition for text rendering, but not a necessary condition. Based on this, we present RepText, which aims to empower pre-trained monolingual text-to-image generation models with the ability to accurately render, or more precisely, replicate, multilingual visual text in user-specified fonts, without the need to really understand them. Specifically, we adopt the setting from ControlNet and additionally integrate language agnostic glyph and position of rendered text to enable generating harmonized visual text, allowing users to customize text content, font and position on their needs. To improve accuracy, a text perceptual loss is employed along with the diffusion loss. Furthermore, to stabilize rendering process, at the inference phase, we directly initialize with noisy glyph latent instead of random initialization, and adopt region masks to restrict the feature injection to only the text region to avoid distortion of the background. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our RepText relative to existing works, our approach outperforms existing open-source methods and achieves comparable results to native multi-language closed-source models. To be more fair, we also exhaustively discuss its limitations in the end.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report. https://reptext.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and generate more realistic images. HDM is a model that incorporates pixel-level operations while maintaining the same training process as DDPM. In HDM, the discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).</p></details> |  | None |

Existing image watermarking methods, though partially effective, often rely on post-processing or reference images, and struggle to balance fidelity, robustness, and tamper localization. To address these limitations, we propose GenPTW, an In-Generation image watermarking framework for latent diffusion models (LDMs), which integrates Provenance Tracing and Tamper Localization into a unified Watermark-based design. It embeds structured watermark signals during the image generation phase, enabling unified provenance tracing and tamper localization. For extraction, we construct a frequency-coordinated decoder to improve robustness and localization precision in complex editing scenarios. Additionally, a distortion layer that simulates AIGC editing is introduced to enhance robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenPTW outperforms existing methods in image fidelity, watermark extraction accuracy, and tamper localization performance, offering an efficient and practical solution for trustworthy AIGC image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in text-to-image models have facilitated generative data augmentation by synthesizing images from labeled data, yet existing methods based solely on class names or reference captions often fail to balance visual diversity and style consistency. In this work, we propose \textbf{Masked Language Prompting (MLP)}, a novel prompting strategy that masks selected words in a reference caption and leverages large language models to generate diverse yet semantically coherent completions. This approach preserves the structural semantics of the original caption while introducing attribute-level variations aligned with the intended style, enabling style-consistent and diverse image generation without fine-tuning. Experimental results on the FashionStyle14 dataset demonstrate that our MLP-based augmentation consistently outperforms class-name and caption-based baselines, validating its effectiveness for fashion style recognition under limited supervision.</p></details> |  | None |

Its time-intensive nature and complexity have spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, or produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically produces human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompt distribution built upon the reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles, and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.</p></details> |  | None |

In order to learn to generate such content, we first create the CineVerse dataset. We use this dataset to train our proposed two-stage approach. First, we prompt a large language model (LLM) with task-specific instructions to take in a high-level scene description and generate a detailed plan for the overall setting and characters, as well as the individual shots. Then, we fine-tune a text-to-image generation model to synthesize high-quality visual keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that CineVerse yields promising improvements in generating visually coherent and contextually rich movie scenes, paving the way for further exploration in cinematic video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>link ...</summary><p>link website: https://cinevers.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Unlike prior methods limited to specific image types (e.g., natural images or geometric visuals), our framework provides a unified solution for captioning natural images, visual text (e.g., posters, UIs, textbooks), and structured visuals (e.g., documents, tables, charts). By converting low-level pixel information into semantically rich textual representations, our framework bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities. Our results highlight three key advantages: (i) Enhanced Visual Reasoning with LLMs, where long-context captions of visual modalities empower LLMs, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 series, to reason effectively in multimodal scenarios; (ii) Improved Image Generation, where detailed captions improve tasks like text-to-image generation and image transformation; and (iii) Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which enables faster convergence with less data. We believe the versatility and adaptability of OmniCaptioner can offer a new perspective for bridging the gap between language and visual modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More visualizations on Homepage: https://alpha-innovator.github.io/OmniCaptioner-project-page and Official code: https://github.com/Alpha-Innovator/OmniCaptioner</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Alpha-Innovator/OmniCaptioner) |

Here, $k$ is a scaling parameter that organizes frequency bands (or projected coefficients), and amplitude describes the norm of such projected coefficients. By incorporating the $K$-amplitude decomposition, K-Flow enables flow matching across the scaling parameter as time. We discuss three venues and six properties of K-Flow, from theoretical foundations, energy and temporal dynamics, and practical applications, respectively. Specifically, from the practical usage perspective, K-Flow allows steerable generation by controlling the information at different scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness of K-Flow, we conduct experiments on unconditional image generation, class-conditional image generation, and molecule assembly generation. Additionally, we conduct three ablation studies to demonstrate how K-Flow steers scaling parameter to effectively control the resolution of image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques. In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

For materials with complex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material failure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in two-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the prediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical engineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are limited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep learning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions. Existing Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven supervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints, which provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed a stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed Multiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution material microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the microstructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive prediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed Neural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By introducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not require paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of stress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress concentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress analysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states through transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction framework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing solutions have tackled these challenges by optimizing the cross-attention mechanism or learning from the caption pairs with minimal semantic changes. However, can we generate high-quality complex contrastive images that diffusion models can directly discriminate based on visual representations? In this work, we leverage large-language models (LLMs) to compose realistic, complex scenarios and harness Visual-Question Answering (VQA) systems alongside diffusion models to automatically curate a contrastive dataset, ConPair, consisting of 15k pairs of high-quality contrastive images. These pairs feature minimal visual discrepancies and cover a wide range of attribute categories, especially complex and natural scenarios. To learn effectively from these error cases, i.e., hard negative images, we propose EvoGen, a new multi-stage curriculum for contrastive learning of diffusion models. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of compositional scenarios, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework on compositional T2I benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose SCoPE (Scheduled interpolation of Coarse-to-fine Prompt Embeddings), a training-free method to improve text-to-image alignment by progressively refining the input prompt in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner. Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image. Our training-free plug-and-play approach significantly enhances prompt alignment, achieves an average improvement of up to +4% in Visual Question Answering (VQA) scores over the Stable Diffusion baselines on 85% of the prompts from the GenAI-Bench dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

In order to deploy these models in extremely resource-constrained edge devices, it is crucial to reduce their peak memory, which is the maximum memory consumed during the execution of a model. A naive approach to reducing peak memory is aggressive down-sampling of feature maps via pooling with large stride, which often results in unacceptable degradation in network performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose residual encoded distillation (ReDistill) for peak memory reduction in a teacher-student framework, in which a student network with less memory is derived from the teacher network using aggressive pooling. We apply our distillation method to multiple problems in computer vision, including image classification and diffusion-based image generation. For image classification, our method yields 4x-5x theoretical peak memory reduction with less degradation in accuracy for most CNN-based architectures. For diffusion-based image generation, our proposed distillation method yields a denoising network with 4x lower theoretical peak memory while maintaining decent diversity and fidelity for image generation. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to other feature-based and response-based distillation methods when applied to the same student network.

However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.

However, fully memorizing such knowledge is impractical due to the vast number of entities and their continuous emergence. To address this, we propose Text-based Intelligent Generation with Entity prompt Refinement (TextTIGER), which augments knowledge on entities included in the prompts and then summarizes the augmented descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate performance degradation from longer inputs. To evaluate our method, we introduce WiT-Cub (WiT with Captions and Uncomplicated Background-explanations), a dataset comprising captions, images, and an entity list. Experiments on four image generation models and five LLMs show that TextTIGER improves image generation performance in standard metrics (IS, FID, and CLIPScore) compared to caption-only prompts. Additionally, multiple annotators' evaluation confirms that the summarized descriptions are more informative, validating LLMs' ability to generate concise yet rich descriptions. These findings demonstrate that refining prompts with augmented and summarized entity-related descriptions enhances image generation capabilities.

Consequently, multi-round interactions are necessary to ensure the generated images meet expectations. Previous methods enhanced prompts via reward feedback but did not optimize over a multi-round dialogue dataset. In this work, we present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback, leveraging a well-trained reward model aligned with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, our framework applies multiple reward functions, such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback, while fine-tuning the diffusion model through LoRA, thus optimizing image generation based on user input. We also construct multi-round dialogue datasets of prompts and image pairs aligned with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving image consistency and alignment with user intent.

To mitigate these concerns, face recognition systems convert raw images into embeddings, traditionally considered privacy-preserving. However, model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing these private facial images, making them a crucial tool for evaluating the privacy risks of face recognition systems. Existing methods usually require training individual generators for each target model, a computationally expensive process. In this paper, we propose DiffUMI, a training-free diffusion-driven universal model inversion attack for face recognition systems. DiffUMI is the first approach to apply a diffusion model for unconditional image generation in model inversion. Unlike other methods, DiffUMI is universal, eliminating the need for training target-specific generators. It operates within a fixed framework and pretrained diffusion model while seamlessly adapting to diverse target identities and models. DiffUMI breaches privacy-preserving face recognition systems with state-of-the-art success, demonstrating that an unconditional diffusion model, coupled with optimized adversarial search, enables efficient and high-fidelity facial reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a novel application of out-of-domain detection (OODD), marking the first use of model inversion to distinguish non-face inputs from face inputs based solely on embeddings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing token grouping methods are often ad hoc and random, disregarding the actual content of the samples. We show that preserving high-information tokens during merging - those essential for semantic fidelity and structural details - significantly improves sample quality, producing finer details and more coherent, realistic generations. Despite being simple and intuitive, this approach remains underexplored. To do so, we propose an importance-based token merging method that prioritizes the most critical tokens in computational resource allocation, leveraging readily available importance scores, such as those from classifier-free guidance in diffusion models. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple applications, including text-to-image synthesis, multi-view image generation, and video generation with various model architectures such as Stable Diffusion, Zero123++, AnimateDiff, or PixArt-$\alpha$.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fast Autoregressive Models for Continuous Latent Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18391v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in sequential data generation, particularly in NLP, but their extension to continuous-domain image generation presents significant challenges. Recent work, the masked autoregressive model (MAR), bypasses quantization by modeling per-token distributions in continuous spaces using a diffusion head but suffers from slow inference due to the high computational cost of the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose the Fast AutoRegressive model (FAR), a novel framework that replaces MAR's diffusion head with a lightweight shortcut head, enabling efficient few-step sampling while preserving autoregressive principles. Additionally, FAR seamlessly integrates with causal Transformers, extending them from discrete to continuous token generation without requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that FAR achieves $2.3\times$ faster inference than MAR while maintaining competitive FID and IS scores. This work establishes the first efficient autoregressive paradigm for high-fidelity continuous-space image generation, bridging the critical gap between quality and scalability in visual autoregressive modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Token-Shuffle: Towards High-Resolution Image Generation with Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17789v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048 with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image generation within MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generative Fields: Uncovering Hierarchical Feature Control for StyleGAN via Inverted Receptive Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17712v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>StyleGAN has demonstrated the ability of GANs to synthesize highly-realistic faces of imaginary people from random noise. One limitation of GAN-based image generation is the difficulty of controlling the features of the generated image, due to the strong entanglement of the low-dimensional latent space. Previous work that aimed to control StyleGAN with image or text prompts modulated sampling in W latent space, which is more expressive than Z latent space. However, W space still has restricted expressivity since it does not control the feature synthesis directly; also the feature embedding in W space requires a pre-training process to reconstruct the style signal, limiting its application. This paper introduces the concept of "generative fields" to explain the hierarchical feature synthesis in StyleGAN, inspired by the receptive fields of convolution neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, we propose a new image editing pipeline for StyleGAN using generative field theory and the channel-wise style latent space S, utilizing the intrinsic structural feature of CNNs to achieve disentangled control of feature synthesis at synthesis time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Synthetic Positives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16965v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning with the nearest neighbor has proved to be one of the most efficient self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques by utilizing the similarity of multiple instances within the same class. However, its efficacy is constrained as the nearest neighbor algorithm primarily identifies "easy" positive pairs, where the representations are already closely located in the embedding space. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Contrastive Learning with Synthetic Positives (CLSP) that utilizes synthetic images, generated by an unconditional diffusion model, as the additional positives to help the model learn from diverse positives. Through feature interpolation in the diffusion model sampling process, we generate images with distinct backgrounds yet similar semantic content to the anchor image. These images are considered "hard" positives for the anchor image, and when included as supplementary positives in the contrastive loss, they contribute to a performance improvement of over 2% and 1% in linear evaluation compared to the previous NNCLR and All4One methods across multiple benchmark datasets such as CIFAR10, achieving state-of-the-art methods. On transfer learning benchmarks, CLSP outperforms existing SSL frameworks on 6 out of 8 downstream datasets. We believe CLSP establishes a valuable baseline for future SSL studies incorporating synthetic data in the training process.</p></details> | 8 pages, conference | None |

So that only easy images are selected for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis scores.

Despite its broad downstream applicability -- ranging from enhanced personalization in image generation to consistent character representation in video rendering -- progress in this field is limited by the lack of reliable automatic evaluation. Existing methods either assess only one aspect of the task (i.e., textual alignment or subject preservation), misalign with human judgments, or rely on costly API-based evaluation. To address this, we introduce RefVNLI, a cost-effective metric that evaluates both textual alignment and subject preservation in a single prediction. Trained on a large-scale dataset derived from video-reasoning benchmarks and image perturbations, RefVNLI outperforms or matches existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and subject categories (e.g., \emph{Animal}, \emph{Object}), achieving up to 6.4-point gains in textual alignment and 8.5-point gains in subject consistency. It also excels with lesser-known concepts, aligning with human preferences at over 87\% accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[StereoMamba: Real-time and Robust Intraoperative Stereo Disparity Estimation via Long-range Spatial Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17401v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo disparity estimation is crucial for obtaining depth information in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS). While current deep learning methods have made significant advancements, challenges remain in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images (1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761), exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DRC: Enhancing Personalized Image Generation via Disentangled Representation Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17349v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image generation has emerged as a promising direction in multimodal content creation. It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics. To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Generalized and Training-Free Text-Guided Semantic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17269v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided semantic manipulation refers to semantically editing an image generated from a source prompt to match a target prompt, enabling the desired semantic changes (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) while preserving irrelevant contents. With the powerful generative capabilities of the diffusion model, the task has shown the potential to generate high-fidelity visual content. Nevertheless, existing methods either typically require time-consuming fine-tuning (inefficient), fail to accomplish multiple semantic manipulations (poorly extensible), and/or lack support for different modality tasks (limited generalizability). Upon further investigation, we find that the geometric properties of noises in the diffusion model are strongly correlated with the semantic changes. Motivated by this, we propose a novel $\textit{GTF}$ for text-guided semantic manipulation, which has the following attractive capabilities: 1) $\textbf{Generalized}$: our $\textit{GTF}$ supports multiple semantic manipulations (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) and can be seamlessly integrated into all diffusion-based methods (i.e., Plug-and-play) across different modalities (i.e., modality-agnostic); and 2) $\textbf{Training-free}$: $\textit{GTF}$ produces high-fidelity results via simply controlling the geometric relationship between noises without tuning or optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, highlighting its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in semantics manipulation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scene Perceived Image Perceptual Score (SPIPS): combining global and local perception for image quality assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17234v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and widespread use of smartphones have resulted in an exponential growth of image data, both real (camera-captured) and virtual (AI-generated). This surge underscores the critical need for robust image quality assessment (IQA) methods that accurately reflect human visual perception. Traditional IQA techniques primarily rely on spatial features - such as signal-to-noise ratio, local structural distortions, and texture inconsistencies - to identify artifacts. While effective for unprocessed or conventionally altered images, these methods fall short in the context of modern image post-processing powered by deep neural networks (DNNs). The rise of DNN-based models for image generation, enhancement, and restoration has significantly improved visual quality, yet made accurate assessment increasingly complex. To address this, we propose a novel IQA approach that bridges the gap between deep learning methods and human perception. Our model disentangles deep features into high-level semantic information and low-level perceptual details, treating each stream separately. These features are then combined with conventional IQA metrics to provide a more comprehensive evaluation framework. This hybrid design enables the model to assess both global context and intricate image details, better reflecting the human visual process, which first interprets overall structure before attending to fine-grained elements. The final stage employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to map the integrated features into a concise quality score. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves improved consistency with human perceptual judgments compared to existing IQA models.</p></details> |  | None |

It can also be easily integrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless, autoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a natural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text generation, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image generation. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right) guides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that this order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image content: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an autoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color of clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this work, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in any-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each patch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune the any-given-order model to produce better-quality images. Through our experiments, we show on two datasets that this new generation method produces better images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training costs and no extra annotations.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel user-centric Interactive AI (IAI) approach for service management, with a distributed GDM-based AIGC framework that emphasizes efficient and cooperative deployment. The proposed method restructures the GDM inference process by allowing users with semantically similar prompts to share parts of the denoising chain. Furthermore, to maximize the users' subjective QoE, we propose an IAI approach, i.e., Reinforcement Learning With Large Language Models Interaction (RLLI), which utilizes Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered generative agents to replicate user interaction, providing real-time and subjective QoE feedback aligned with diverse user personalities. Lastly, we present the GDM-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDDPG) algorithm, adapted to the proposed RLLI framework, to allocate communication and computing resources effectively while accounting for subjective user traits and dynamic wireless conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that G-DDPG improves total QoE by 15% compared with the standard DDPG algorithm.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Model (VFM) within an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to enhance feature integration. This design captures detailed global representations and preserves essential spectral characteristics, treating RGB-to-NIR translation as more than a simple domain transfer problem. A multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator ensures realistic image generation at various detail levels, while carefully designed loss functions couple global context understanding with local feature preservation. We performed experiments on the RANUS dataset to demonstrate Pix2Next's advantages in quantitative metrics and visual quality, improving the FID score by 34.81% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of Pix2Next by showing improved performance on a downstream object detection task using generated NIR data to augment limited real NIR datasets. The proposed approach enables the scaling up of NIR datasets without additional data acquisition or annotation efforts, potentially accelerating advancements in NIR-based computer vision applications.</p></details> | 19 pages,12 figures | None |

However, due to the inherent complexity of digital images, issues of invisibility and security persist when using CNN models for information embedding. In this paper, we propose Curriculum Learning Progressive Steganophy Network (CLPSTNet). The network consists of multiple progressive multi-scale convolutional modules that integrate Inception structures and dilated convolutions. The module contains multiple branching pathways, starting from a smaller convolutional kernel and dilatation rate, extracting the basic, local feature information from the feature map, and gradually expanding to the convolution with a larger convolutional kernel and dilatation rate for perceiving the feature information of a larger receptive field, so as to realize the multi-scale feature extraction from shallow to deep, and from fine to coarse, allowing the shallow secret information features to be refined in different fusion stages. The experimental results show that the proposed CLPSTNet not only has high PSNR , SSIM metrics and decoding accuracy on three large public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, but also the steganographic images generated by CLPSTNet have low steganalysis scores.You can find our code at \href{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet) |

However, relationships between potential flows and explicit EBMs remain underexplored, while contrastive divergence training via implicit Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is often unstable and expensive in high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose Variational Potential Flow Bayes (VPFB), a new energy-based generative framework that eliminates the need for implicit MCMC sampling and does not rely on auxiliary networks or cooperative training. VPFB learns an energy-parameterized potential flow by constructing a flow-driven density homotopy that is matched to the data distribution through a variational loss minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the flow-driven and marginal homotopies. This principled formulation enables robust and efficient generative modeling while preserving the interpretability of EBMs. Experimental results on image generation, interpolation, out-of-distribution detection, and compositional generation confirm the effectiveness of VPFB, showing that our method performs competitively with existing approaches in terms of sample quality and versatility across diverse generative modeling tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> | None |

Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks. However, this requires separate model architectures, training designs, and multiple parameter sets to handle different tasks. In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce a novel generative image modeling framework that seamlessly bridges this gap by leveraging a diffusion model to jointly model low-level image latents (from a variational autoencoder) and high-level semantic features (from a pretrained self-supervised encoder like DINO). Our latent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature pairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and training efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard Diffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex distillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a powerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages learned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both conditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial improvements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a new direction for representation-aware generative modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

Tuning-based approaches rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive subject-specific optimization, while zero-shot methods fail to maintain adequate subject consistency. In this work, we propose FreeGraftor, a training-free framework that addresses these limitations through cross-image feature grafting. Specifically, FreeGraftor employs semantic matching and position-constrained attention fusion to transfer visual details from reference subjects to the generated image. Additionally, our framework incorporates a novel noise initialization strategy to preserve geometry priors of reference subjects for robust feature matching. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method enables precise subject identity transfer while maintaining text-aligned scene synthesis. Without requiring model fine-tuning or additional training, FreeGraftor significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and training-free approaches in both subject fidelity and text alignment. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly extend to multi-subject generation, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Previous efforts mainly concentrated on single-view generation, often resulting in inconsistencies across neighboring ground views. In this work, we propose a novel cross-view synthesis approach designed to overcome these challenges by ensuring consistency across ground-view images generated from satellite views. Our method, based on a fixed latent diffusion model, introduces two conditioning modules: satellite-guided denoising, which extracts high-level scene layout to guide the denoising process, and satellite-temporal denoising, which captures camera motion to maintain consistency across multiple generated views. We further contribute a large-scale satellite-ground dataset containing over 100,000 perspective pairs to facilitate extensive ground scene or video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods on perceptual and temporal metrics, achieving high photorealism and consistency in multi-view outputs.</p></details> | 8 figures | None |

However, the guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets, image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of our flow matching guidance framework.

While existing jailbreak studies primarily focus on VLMs' susceptibility to harmful instructions, we reveal a fundamental yet overlooked vulnerability: toxic text continuation, where VLMs produce highly toxic completions when prompted with harmful text prefixes paired with semantically adversarial images. To systematically study this threat, we propose Red Team Diffuser (RTD), the first red teaming diffusion model that coordinates adversarial image generation and toxic continuation through reinforcement learning. Our key innovations include dynamic cross-modal attack and stealth-aware optimization. For toxic text prefixes from an LLM safety benchmark, we conduct greedy search to identify optimal image prompts that maximally induce toxic completions. The discovered image prompts then drive RL-based diffusion model fine-tuning, producing semantically aligned adversarial images that boost toxicity rates. Stealth-aware optimization introduces joint adversarial rewards that balance toxicity maximization (via Detoxify classifier) and stealthiness (via BERTScore), circumventing traditional noise-based adversarial patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RTD, increasing the toxicity rate of LLaVA outputs by 10.69% over text-only baselines on the original attack set and 8.91% on an unseen set, proving generalization capability. Moreover, RTD exhibits strong cross-model transferability, raising the toxicity rate by 5.1% on Gemini and 26.83% on LLaMA. Our findings expose two critical flaws in current VLM alignment: (1) failure to prevent toxic continuation from harmful prefixes, and (2) overlooking cross-modal attack vectors. These results necessitate a paradigm shift toward multimodal red teaming in safety evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Harmonizing Visual Representations for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21979v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying visual understanding and generation within a single multimodal framework remains a significant challenge, as the two inherently heterogeneous tasks require representations at different levels of granularity. Current approaches that utilize vector quantization (VQ) or variational autoencoders (VAE) for unified visual representation prioritize intrinsic imagery features over semantics, compromising understanding performance. In this work, we take inspiration from masked image modelling (MIM) that learns rich semantics via a mask-and-reconstruct pre-training and its successful extension to masked autoregressive (MAR) image generation. A preliminary study on the MAR encoder's representation reveals exceptional linear probing accuracy and precise feature response to visual concepts, which indicates MAR's potential for visual understanding tasks beyond its original generation role. Based on these insights, we present \emph{Harmon}, a unified autoregressive framework that harmonizes understanding and generation tasks with a shared MAR encoder. Through a three-stage training procedure that progressively optimizes understanding and generation capabilities, Harmon achieves state-of-the-art image generation results on the GenEval, MJHQ30K and WISE benchmarks while matching the performance of methods with dedicated semantic encoders (e.g., Janus) on image understanding benchmarks.

| **[Gungnir: Exploiting Stylistic Features in Images for Backdoor Attacks on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20650v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated significant advances in the field of image generation. However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that Gungnir can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0 backdoor detection rate (BDR). Our codes are available at https://github.com/paoche11/Gungnir.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/paoche11/Gungnir) |

Understanding the dynamics of the reverse diffusion process is crucial in steering the generation and achieving high sample quality. However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), aim at uncovering the operating principles of models through granular analysis of their internal representations. These MI techniques have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we show that the discovered concepts have a causal effect on the model output and can be leveraged to steer the generative process. We design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages of diffusion image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages of diffusion only minor textural details are subject to change.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 32 figures, preliminary version</p></details> | None |

However, user prompts often contain ambiguities, making it difficult for these systems to interpret users' actual intentions. Consequently, many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in our proposed dataset. Our annotation tools and several examples of our dataset are available at https://zenodo.org/records/14876029 for easier review.

However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

A key issue in this method is how to define steganographic distortion. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, the definition of distortion has evolved from manual design to deep learning design. Concurrently, rapid advancements in image generation have made generated images viable as cover media. However, existing distortion design methods based on machine learning do not fully leverage the advantages of generated cover media, resulting in suboptimal security performance. To address this issue, we propose GIFDL (Generated Image Fluctuation Distortion Learning), a steganographic distortion learning method based on the fluctuations in generated images. Inspired by the idea of natural steganography, we take a series of highly similar fluctuation images as the input to the steganographic distortion generator and introduce a new GAN training strategy to disguise stego images as fluctuation images. Experimental results demonstrate that GIFDL, compared with state-of-the-art GAN-based distortion learning methods, exhibits superior resistance to steganalysis, increasing the detection error rates by an average of 3.30% across three steganalyzers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TIFS</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements have positioned diffusion models as effective MDE tools by framing the challenge as a conditional image generation task. Despite their progress, these methods often struggle with accurately reconstructing distant depths, due largely to the imbalanced distribution of depth values and an over-reliance on spatial-domain features. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VistaDepth, a novel framework that integrates adaptive frequency-domain feature enhancements with an adaptive weight-balancing mechanism into the diffusion process. Central to our approach is the Latent Frequency Modulation (LFM) module, which dynamically refines spectral responses in the latent feature space, thereby improving the preservation of structural details and reducing noisy artifacts. Furthermore, we implement an adaptive weighting strategy that modulates the diffusion loss in real-time, enhancing the model's sensitivity towards distant depth reconstruction. These innovations collectively result in superior depth perception performance across both distance and detail. Experimental evaluations confirm that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion-based MDE techniques, particularly excelling in the accurate reconstruction of distant regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Generative AI models have made it possible to create high-quality images, but concerns about copyright infringement are a hindrance to their abundant use. As these models use data from training images to generate new ones, it is often a daunting task to ensure they do not violate intellectual property rights. Some AI models have even been noted to directly copy copyrighted images, a problem often referred to as source copying. Traditional copyright protection measures such as watermarks and metadata have also proven to be futile in this regard. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-step image generation model inspired by the conditional diffusion model. The first step involves creating an image segmentation mask for some prompt-based generated images. This mask embodies the shape of the image. Thereafter, the diffusion model is asked to generate the image anew while avoiding the shape in question. This approach shows a decrease in structural similarity from the training image, i.e. we are able to avoid the source copying problem using this approach without expensive retraining of the model or user-centered prompt generation techniques. This makes our approach the most computationally inexpensive approach to avoiding both copyright infringement and source copying for diffusion model-based image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, preprint</p></details> | None |

In this work, we present Twin-Co, a framework that leverages synchronized, co-adaptive dialogue to progressively refine image generation. Instead of a static generation process, Twin-Co employs a dynamic, iterative workflow where an intelligent dialogue agent continuously interacts with the user. Initially, a base image is generated from the user's prompt. Then, through a series of synchronized dialogue exchanges, the system adapts and optimizes the image according to evolving user feedback. The co-adaptive process allows the system to progressively narrow down ambiguities and better align with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that Twin-Co not only enhances user experience by reducing trial-and-error iterations but also improves the quality of the generated images, streamlining the creative process across various applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14815v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted material, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model and 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures | None |

This study introduces CRF-GAN, a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture that enhances structural consistency in 3D medical image synthesis. Integrating Conditional Random Fields within a two-step generation process allows CRF-GAN improving spatial coherence while maintaining high-resolution image quality. The model's performance is evaluated against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model. Materials and Methods: We evaluate the performance of CRF-GAN against the HA-GAN model. The comparison between the two models was made through a quantitative evaluation, using FID and MMD metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, to assess the realism of the generated images. Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID and MMD scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings. Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. The key objective was not only to lower the computational cost but also to reallocate the freed-up resources towards the creation of higher-resolution 3D imaging, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability. Moreover, unlike many previous studies, we combined qualitative and quantitative assessments to obtain a more holistic feedback on the model's performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted to Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine</p></details> | None |

This gap hinders the model's ability to synthesize coherent and novel visual representations from textual prompts, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multi-modal learning. In this work, we propose MedUnifier, a unified VLP framework tailored for medical data. MedUnifier seamlessly integrates text-grounded image generation capabilities with multi-modal learning strategies, including image-text contrastive alignment, image-text matching and image-grounded text generation. Unlike traditional methods that reply on continuous visual representations, our approach employs visual vector quantization, which not only facilitates a more cohesive learning strategy for cross-modal understanding but also enhances multi-modal generation quality by effectively leveraging discrete representations. Our framework's effectiveness is evidenced by the experiments on established benchmarks, including uni-modal tasks (supervised fine-tuning), cross-modal tasks (image-text retrieval and zero-shot image classification), and multi-modal tasks (medical report generation, image synthesis), where it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. MedUnifier also offers a highly adaptable tool for a wide range of language and vision tasks in healthcare, marking advancement toward the development of a generalizable AI model for medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be pubilshed in CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches rely on spatial visual tokens, where image patches are encoded and arranged according to a spatial order (e.g., raster scan). However, we show that spatial tokens lack the recursive structure inherent to languages, hence form an impossible language for LLM to master. In this paper, we build a proper visual language by leveraging diffusion timesteps to learn discrete, recursive visual tokens. Our proposed tokens recursively compensate for the progressive attribute loss in noisy images as timesteps increase, enabling the diffusion model to reconstruct the original image at any timestep. This approach allows us to effectively integrate the strengths of LLMs in autoregressive reasoning and diffusion models in precise image generation, achieving seamless multimodal comprehension and generation within a unified framework.

It makes the hiding capacity of GS higher than that of traditional steganography, as well as more resistant to classical steganalysis. However, the generators and extractors of existing GS methods can only target specific formats and types of data and lack of universality. Besides, the model size is usually related to the underlying grid resolution, and the transmission behavior of the extractor is susceptible to suspicion of steganalysis. Implicit neural representation(INR) is a technique for representing data in a continuous manner. Inspired by this, we propose an INR-based generative steganography by point cloud representation (INR-GSPC). By using the function generator, the problem of the generator model size growing exponentially with the increase of gridded data has been solved. That is able to generate a wide range of data types and break through the limitation of resolution. In order to unify the data formats of the generator and message extractor, the data is converted to point cloud representation. We designed and fixed a point cloud message extractor. By iterating over the point cloud with adding small perturbations to generate stego-media. This method can avoid the training and transmission process of the message extractor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to apply point cloud to generative steganography. Experiments demonstrate that the stego-images generated by the scheme have an average PSNR value of more than 65, and the accuracy of message extraction reaches more than 99%.</p></details> | 10pages,13figures | None |

Timely disclosure and mitigation of security vulnerabilities in T2I models are crucial for ensuring the safe deployment of generative models. We explore a novel training-free backdoor poisoning paradigm through model editing, which is recently employed for knowledge updating in large language models. Nevertheless, we reveal the potential security risks posed by model editing techniques to image generation models. In this work, we establish the principles for backdoor attacks based on model editing, and propose a relationship-driven precise backdoor poisoning method, REDEditing. Drawing on the principles of equivalent-attribute alignment and stealthy poisoning, we develop an equivalent relationship retrieval and joint-attribute transfer approach that ensures consistent backdoor image generation through concept rebinding. A knowledge isolation constraint is proposed to preserve benign generation integrity. Our method achieves an 11\% higher attack success rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Remarkably, adding just one line of code enhances output naturalness while improving backdoor stealthiness by 24\%.

Recently, many methods based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework have been proposed to address sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Although these methods have made considerable advancements, they still show significant issues with overfitting. To reduce the overfitting, we introduce VGNC, a novel Validation-guided Gaussian Number Control (VGNC) approach based on generative novel view synthesis (NVS) models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to alleviate the overfitting issue of sparse-view 3DGS with generative validation images. Specifically, we first introduce a validation image generation method based on a generative NVS model. We then propose a Gaussian number control strategy that utilizes generated validation images to determine the optimal Gaussian numbers, thereby reducing the issue of overfitting. We conducted detailed experiments on various sparse-view 3DGS baselines and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of VGNC. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only reduces overfitting but also improves rendering quality on the test set while decreasing the number of Gaussian points. This reduction lowers storage demands and accelerates both training and rendering. The code will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages,8 figures | None |

However, due to the complex and diverse pathological features of medical images and the imbalanced class distribution in medical data, generating high-quality and diverse medical images from limited data is significantly challenging. Additionally, to fully leverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure information and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding distortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical relevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we propose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent pathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and utilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the generation of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation through causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features. Here, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological and identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by pathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation of diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging a large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical reports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model on long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent work on semantic image synthesis mainly follows the de facto GAN-based approaches, which may lead to unsatisfactory quality or diversity of generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on DDPM for semantic image synthesis. Unlike previous conditional diffusion model directly feeds the semantic layout and noisy image as input to a U-Net structure, which may not fully leverage the information in the input semantic mask, our framework processes semantic layout and noisy image differently. It feeds noisy image to the encoder of the U-Net structure while the semantic layout to the decoder by multi-layer spatially-adaptive normalization operators. To further improve the generation quality and semantic interpretability in semantic image synthesis, we introduce the classifier-free guidance sampling strategy, which acknowledge the scores of an unconditional model for sampling process. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity (FID) and diversity (LPIPS).

To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Towards NSFW-Free Text-to-Image Generation via Safety-Constraint Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14290v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of generated content remains a fundamental challenge for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. Existing studies either fail to guarantee complete safety under potentially harmful concepts or struggle to balance safety with generation quality. To address these issues, we propose Safety-Constrained Direct Preference Optimization (SC-DPO), a novel framework for safety alignment in T2I models. SC-DPO integrates safety constraints into the general human preference calibration, aiming to maximize the likelihood of generating human-preferred samples while minimizing the safety cost of the generated outputs. In SC-DPO, we introduce a safety cost model to accurately quantify harmful levels for images, and train it effectively using the proposed contrastive learning and cost anchoring objectives. To apply SC-DPO for effective T2I safety alignment, we constructed SCP-10K, a safety-constrained preference dataset containing rich harmful concepts, which blends safety-constrained preference pairs under both harmful and clean instructions, further mitigating the trade-off between safety and sample quality. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Focusing Mechanism (DFM) for SC-DPO, promoting the model's learning of difficult preference pair samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-DPO outperforms existing methods, effectively defending against various NSFW content while maintaining optimal sample quality and human preference alignment. Additionally, SC-DPO exhibits resilience against adversarial prompts designed to generate harmful content.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Edge-preserving noise for diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01540v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that generalizes over existing isotropic models by considering a hybrid noise scheme. In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also particularly more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results (FID and CLIP score) showing consistent improvements of up to 30% for both tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for Video Saliency Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14267v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video saliency prediction is crucial for downstream applications, such as video compression and human-computer interaction. With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging RWKV-7's linear-complexity Weighted Key-Value (WKV) architecture, CrossWKV integrates text and image modalities in a single pass, utilizing a generalized delta rule with vector-valued gating and low-rank adaptations (LoRA) to achieve superior cross-modal alignment. Unlike Transformer-based models, CrossWKV's non-diagonal, input-dependent transition matrix enables it to represent complex functions beyond the $\mathrm{TC}^0$ complexity class, including all regular languages, as demonstrated by its ability to perform state-tracking tasks like $S_5$ permutation modeling. Evaluated within the Diffusion in RWKV-7 (DIR-7) on datasets such as LAION-5B and ImageNet, CrossWKV achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.88 and a CLIP score of 0.33 on ImageNet 256x256, matching state-of-the-art performance while offering robust generalization across diverse prompts. The model's enhanced expressivity, combined with constant memory usage and linear scaling, positions it as a powerful solution for advanced cross-modal tasks, with potential applications in high-resolution generation and dynamic state manipulation.Code at https://github.com/TorchRWKV/flash-linear-attention</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TorchRWKV/flash-linear-attention) |

We argue that fake image detection should not operate as a "black box". Instead, an ideal approach must ensure both strong generalization and transparency. Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offers new opportunities for reasoning-based AI-generated image detection. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in comparison to traditional detection methods and human evaluators, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we design six distinct prompts and propose a framework that integrates these prompts to develop a more robust, explainable, and reasoning-driven detection system.

Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability.</p></details> |  | None |

By framing the task as grid-based image completion and simply replicating the subject image(s) in a mosaic layout, we activate strong identity-preserving capabilities without any additional data, training, or inference-time fine-tuning. This "free lunch" approach is further strengthened by a novel cascade attention design and meta prompting technique, boosting fidelity and versatility. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines across multiple key metrics in benchmarks and human preference studies, with trade-offs in certain aspects. Additionally, it supports diverse edits, including logo insertion, virtual try-on, and subject replacement or insertion. These results demonstrate that a pre-trained foundational text-to-image model can enable high-quality, resource-efficient subject-driven generation, opening new possibilities for lightweight customization in downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Language Patterns of Prompts in Text-to-Image Generation and Their Impact on Visual Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14125v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following the initial excitement, Text-to-Image (TTI) models are now being examined more critically. While much of the discourse has focused on biases and stereotypes embedded in large-scale training datasets, the sociotechnical dynamics of user interactions with these models remain underexplored. This study examines the linguistic and semantic choices users make when crafting prompts and how these choices influence the diversity of generated outputs. Analyzing over six million prompts from the Civiverse dataset on the CivitAI platform across seven months, we categorize users into three groups based on their levels of linguistic experimentation: consistent repeaters, occasional repeaters, and non-repeaters. Our findings reveal that as user participation grows over time, prompt language becomes increasingly homogenized through the adoption of popular community tags and descriptors, with repeated prompts comprising 40-50% of submissions. At the same time, semantic similarity and topic preferences remain relatively stable, emphasizing common subjects and surface aesthetics. Using Vendi scores to quantify visual diversity, we demonstrate a clear correlation between lexical similarity in prompts and the visual similarity of generated images, showing that linguistic repetition reinforces less diverse representations. These findings highlight the significant role of user-driven factors in shaping AI-generated imagery, beyond inherent model biases, and underscore the need for tools and practices that encourage greater linguistic and thematic experimentation within TTI systems to foster more inclusive and diverse AI-generated content.</p></details> |  | None |

Established on the off-the-shelf text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, we propose a novel training-free text-guided image-to-image (I2I) translation framework dubbed as \textbf{P}hase-\textbf{T}ransferred \textbf{Diffusion} Model (PTDiffusion) for hidden art syntheses. PTDiffusion harmoniously embeds an input reference image into arbitrary scenes described by the text prompts, producing illusion images exhibiting hidden visual cues of the reference image. At the heart of our method is a plug-and-play phase transfer mechanism that dynamically and progressively transplants diffusion features' phase spectrum from the denoising process to reconstruct the reference image into the one to sample the generated illusion image, realizing deep fusion of the reference structural information and the textual semantic information in the diffusion model latent space. Furthermore, we propose asynchronous phase transfer to enable flexible control to the degree of hidden content discernability. Our method bypasses any model training and fine-tuning process, all while substantially outperforming related text-guided I2I methods in image generation quality, text fidelity, visual discernibility, and contextual naturalness for illusion picture synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments.

| **[Entropy Rectifying Guidance for Diffusion and Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13987v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance techniques are commonly used in diffusion and flow models to improve image quality and consistency for conditional generative tasks such as class-conditional and text-to-image generation. In particular, classifier-free guidance (CFG) -- the most widely adopted guidance technique -- contrasts conditional and unconditional predictions to improve the generated images. This results, however, in trade-offs across quality, diversity and consistency, improving some at the expense of others. While recent work has shown that it is possible to disentangle these factors to some extent, such methods come with an overhead of requiring an additional (weaker) model, or require more forward passes per sampling step. In this paper, we propose Entropy Rectifying Guidance (ERG), a simple and effective guidance mechanism based on inference-time changes in the attention mechanism of state-of-the-art diffusion transformer architectures, which allows for simultaneous improvements over image quality, diversity and prompt consistency. ERG is more general than CFG and similar guidance techniques, as it extends to unconditional sampling. ERG results in significant improvements in various generation tasks such as text-to-image, class-conditional and unconditional image generation. We also show that ERG can be seamlessly combined with other recent guidance methods such as CADS and APG, further boosting generation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

By initializing from multimodal Generative PreTraining (mGPT), we demonstrate that decoder-only Autoregressive (AR) model can achieve image generation performance comparable to modern diffusion models with high efficiency through Flexible Progressive Supervised Fine-tuning (FP-SFT). Equipped with our proposed Unambiguous image Representation (UniRep), Lumina-mGPT can flexibly generate high-quality images of varying aspect ratios. Building on the strong image generation capabilities, we further explore Ominiponent Supervised Fine-tuning (Omni-SFT), an initial attempt to elevate Lumina-mGPT into a unified multi-modal generalist. The resulting model demonstrates versatile multimodal capabilities, including visual generation tasks like text-to-image/multiview generation and controllable generation, visual recognition tasks like segmentation and depth estimation, and vision-language tasks like multi-turn visual question answering, showing the rosy potential of the technical direction.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect AI-generated images (AIGI). Despite progress in AIGI detection, achieving reliable performance across diverse generation models and scenes remains challenging due to the lack of source-invariant features and limited generalization capabilities in existing methods. In this work, we explore the potential of using image entropy as a cue for AIGI detection and propose Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of entropy feature maps computed across shuffled small patches over multiple image scaled. MLEP comprehensively captures pixel relationships across dimensions and scales while significantly disrupting image semantics, reducing potential content bias. Leveraging MLEP, a robust CNN-based classifier for AIGI detection can be trained. Extensive experiments conducted in an open-world scenario, evaluating images synthesized by 32 distinct generative models, demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, effective interaction with these models is challenging for average users due to the need for specialized prompt engineering knowledge and the inability to perform multi-turn image generation, hindering a dynamic and iterative creation process. Recent attempts have tried to equip Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with T2I models to bring the user's natural language instructions into reality. Hence, the output modality of MLLMs is extended, and the multi-turn generation quality of T2I models is enhanced thanks to the strong multi-modal comprehension ability of MLLMs. However, many of these works face challenges in identifying correct output modalities and generating coherent images accordingly as the number of output modalities increases and the conversations go deeper. Therefore, we propose DialogGen, an effective pipeline to align off-the-shelf MLLMs and T2I models to build a Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System (MIDS) for multi-turn Text-to-Image generation. It is composed of drawing prompt alignment, careful training data curation, and error correction. Moreover, as the field of MIDS flourishes, comprehensive benchmarks are urgently needed to evaluate MIDS fairly in terms of output modality correctness and multi-modal output coherence. To address this issue, we introduce the Multi-modal Dialogue Benchmark (DialogBen), a comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to assess the ability of MLLMs to generate accurate and coherent multi-modal content that supports image editing. It contains two evaluation metrics to measure the model's ability to switch modalities and the coherence of the output images. Our extensive experiments on DialogBen and user study demonstrate the effectiveness of DialogGen compared with other State-of-the-Art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hunyuan-dialoggen.github.io/.

Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional diffusion models such as SR3 and I$^2$SB in efficiency and image quality.

Prior approaches have difficulties in recovering fine-grained details and true colors of the scene under extremely low-light environments due to near-to-zero SNR. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown significant progress towards general domain image generation. In this paper, we propose to leverage the pre-trained latent diffusion model to perform the neural ISP for enhancing extremely low-light images. Specifically, to tailor the pre-trained latent diffusion model to operate on the RAW domain, we train a set of lightweight taming modules to inject the RAW information into the diffusion denoising process via modulating the intermediate features of UNet. We further observe different roles of UNet denoising and decoder reconstruction in the latent diffusion model, which inspires us to decompose the low-light image enhancement task into latent-space low-frequency content generation and decoding-phase high-frequency detail maintenance. Through extensive experiments on representative datasets, we demonstrate our simple design not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative evaluations but also shows significant superiority in visual comparisons over strong baselines, which highlight the effectiveness of powerful generative priors for neural ISP under extremely low-light environments.

To address this problem, we propose U-Shape Mamba (USM), a novel diffusion model that leverages Mamba-based layers within a U-Net-like hierarchical structure. By progressively reducing sequence length in the encoder and restoring it in the decoder through Mamba blocks, USM significantly lowers computational overhead while maintaining strong generative capabilities. Experimental results against Zigma, which is currently the most efficient Mamba-based diffusion model, demonstrate that USM achieves one-third the GFlops, requires less memory and is faster, while outperforming Zigma in image quality. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is improved by 15.3, 0.84 and 2.7 points on AFHQ, CelebAHQ and COCO datasets, respectively. These findings highlight USM as a highly efficient and scalable solution for diffusion-based generative models, making high-quality image synthesis more accessible to the research community while reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepeted at CVPR 2025 eLVM workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[Early Timestep Zero-Shot Candidate Selection for Instruction-Guided Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13490v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image generation and editing remains challenging due to the inherent diversity induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external supervision or training.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many large-scale text-to-image systems are designed for broad applicability, yielding conventional output that may limit creative exploration. They also employ interaction methods that may be difficult for beginners. Given that creative end users often operate in diverse, context-specific ways that are often unpredictable, more variation and personalization are necessary. We introduce POET, a real-time interactive tool that (1) automatically discovers dimensions of homogeneity in text-to-image generative models, (2) expands these dimensions to diversify the output space of generated images, and (3) learns from user feedback to personalize expansions. An evaluation with 28 users spanning four creative task domains demonstrated POET's ability to generate results with higher perceived diversity and help users reach satisfaction in fewer prompts during creative tasks, thereby prompting them to deliberate and reflect more on a wider range of possible produced results during the co-creative process. Focusing on visual creativity, POET offers a first glimpse of how interaction techniques of future text-to-image generation tools may support and align with more pluralistic values and the needs of end users during the ideation stages of their work.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real paired front and back images of human subjects are rarely available with privacy, ethical and cost of acquisition, which restricts scalability of the data. Additionally, learning priors from image inputs using deep generative models, such as GANs or diffusion models, to infer unseen regions such as the human back often leads to artifacts, structural inconsistencies, or loss of fine-grained detail. To address these issues, we present SMPL-GPTexture (skinned multi-person linear model - general purpose Texture), a novel pipeline that takes natural language prompts as input and leverages a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model to produce paired high-resolution front and back images of a human subject as the starting point for texture estimation. Using the generated paired dual-view images, we first employ a human mesh recovery model to obtain a robust 2D-to-3D SMPL alignment between image pixels and the 3D model's UV coordinates for each views. Second, we use an inverted rasterization technique that explicitly projects the observed colour from the input images into the UV space, thereby producing accurate, complete texture maps. Finally, we apply a diffusion-based inpainting module to fill in the missing regions, and the fusion mechanism then combines these results into a unified full texture map. Extensive experiments shows that our SMPL-GPTexture can generate high resolution texture aligned with user's prompts.</p></details> |  | None |

As the quality of base-model generated images continues to improve, so does the demand for further application like image editing. In recent years, many remarkable works are realizing a wide variety of editing effects. However, the wide variety of editing types and diverse editing approaches have made it difficult for researchers to establish a comprehensive view of the development of this field. In this survey, we summarize the image editing field from four aspects: tasks definition, methods classification, results evaluation and editing datasets. First, we provide a definition of image editing, which in turn leads to a variety of editing task forms from the perspective of operation parts and manipulation actions. Subsequently, we categorize and summary methods for implementing editing into three categories: inversion-based, fine-tuning-based and adapter-based. In addition, we organize the currently used metrics, available datasets and corresponding construction methods. At the end, we present some visions for the future development of the image editing field based on the previous summaries.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap between 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity scenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key insight is treating scenes as hierarchical "objects" under isometric views, where a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into manipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D content that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional structure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed instance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that effectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape prior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements and complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while maintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://zju3dv.github.io/hiscene/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zju3dv.github.io/hiscene) |
| **[ArtistAuditor: Auditing Artist Style Pirate in Text-to-Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13061v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles (perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable. To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely, ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then, ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions. The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario.

However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions.

Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning. Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing privacy-preserving generative AI.</p></details> |  | None |

Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the \emph{static} inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain \emph{diffusion timesteps} and \emph{spatial regions}. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose \textbf{Dy}namic \textbf{Di}ffusion \textbf{T}ransformer (DyDiT), an architecture that \emph{dynamically} adjusts its computation along both \emph{timestep} and \emph{spatial} dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a \emph{Timestep-wise Dynamic Width} (TDW) approach that adapts model width conditioned on the generation timesteps. In addition, we design a \emph{Spatial-wise Dynamic Token} (SDT) strategy to avoid redundant computation at unnecessary spatial locations. TDW and SDT can be seamlessly integrated into DiT and significantly accelerates the generation process. Building on these designs, we further enhance DyDiT in three key aspects. First, DyDiT is integrated seamlessly with flow matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended journal version for ICLR. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.03456</p></details> | None |

However, due to the computationally intensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux images needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction Denoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), which uses a branch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to improve the accuracy of generated black hole images based on seven physical parameters of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters. By enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50 for parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter prediction performance. This approach reduces computational costs and provides a faster, more efficient method for dataset expansion, parameter estimation, and model fitting.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, conventional VAEs often generate relatively blurry images due to their assumption of an isotropic Gaussian latent space and constraints in capturing high-frequency details. In this paper, we explore a novel wavelet-based approach (Wavelet-VAE) in which the latent space is constructed using multi-scale Haar wavelet coefficients. We propose a comprehensive method to encode the image features into multi-scale detail and approximation coefficients and introduce a learnable noise parameter to maintain stochasticity. We thoroughly discuss how to reformulate the reparameterization trick, address the KL divergence term, and integrate wavelet sparsity principles into the training objective. Our experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and other high-resolution datasets demonstrates that the Wavelet-VAE improves visual fidelity and recovers higher-resolution details compared to conventional VAEs. We conclude with a discussion of advantages, potential limitations, and future research directions for wavelet-based generative modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

These advancements have sparked research in fake image detection and attribution, yet prior studies have not fully explored the practical and scientific dimensions of this task. In addition to attributing images to 12 state-of-the-art T2I generators, we provide extensive analyses on what inference stage hyperparameters and image modifications are discernible. Our experiments reveal that initialization seeds are highly detectable, along with other subtle variations in the image generation process to some extent. We further investigate what visual traces are leveraged in image attribution by perturbing high-frequency details and employing mid-level representations of image style and structure. Notably, altering high-frequency information causes only slight reductions in accuracy, and training an attributor on style representations outperforms training on RGB images.

By varying the random seeds, we can generate many images for a fixed text prompt. Technically, the seed controls the initial noise and, in multi-step diffusion inference, the noise used for reparameterization at intermediate timesteps in the reverse diffusion process. However, the specific impact of the random seed on the generated images remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale scientific study into the impact of random seeds during diffusion inference. Remarkably, we reveal that the best 'golden' seed achieved an impressive FID of 21.60, compared to the worst 'inferior' seed's FID of 31.97. Additionally, a classifier can predict the seed number used to generate an image with over 99.9% accuracy in just a few epochs, establishing that seeds are highly distinguishable based on generated images. Encouraged by these findings, we examined the influence of seeds on interpretable visual dimensions. We find that certain seeds consistently produce grayscale images, prominent sky regions, or image borders. Seeds also affect image composition, including object location, size, and depth. Moreover, by leveraging these 'golden' seeds, we demonstrate improved image generation such as high-fidelity inference and diversified sampling. Our investigation extends to inpainting tasks, where we uncover some seeds that tend to insert unwanted text artifacts. Overall, our extensive analyses highlight the importance of selecting good seeds and offer practical utility for image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, optimization-based methods require subject-specific fine-tuning, which inevitably degrades textual controllability. To address these challenges, we propose InstantCharacter, a scalable framework for character customization built upon a foundation diffusion transformer. InstantCharacter demonstrates three fundamental advantages: first, it achieves open-domain personalization across diverse character appearances, poses, and styles while maintaining high-fidelity results. Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked transformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character features and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion transformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a large-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset is systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired (text-image combinations) subsets. This dual-data structure enables simultaneous optimization of identity consistency and textual editability through distinct learning pathways. Qualitative experiments demonstrate the advanced capabilities of InstantCharacter in generating high-fidelity, text-controllable, and character-consistent images, setting a new benchmark for character-driven image generation.

This overwhelming specialized model production introduces new challenges for high parameter redundancy and huge storage cost, thereby necessitating the development of effective methods to consolidate and unify the capabilities of diverse powerful models into a single one. A common practice in model merging adopts static linear interpolation in the parameter space to achieve the goal of style mixing. However, it neglects the features of T2I generation task that numerous distinct models cover sundry styles which may lead to incompatibility and confusion in the merged model. To address this issue, we introduce a style-promptable image generation pipeline which can accurately generate arbitrary-style images under the control of style vectors. Based on this design, we propose the score distillation based model merging paradigm (DMM), compressing multiple models into a single versatile T2I model. Moreover, we rethink and reformulate the model merging task in the context of T2I generation, by presenting new merging goals and evaluation protocols. Our experiments demonstrate that DMM can compactly reorganize the knowledge from multiple teacher models and achieve controllable arbitrary-style generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional demoir\'eing methods have generally treated images as a whole for processing and training, neglecting the unique signal characteristics of different color channels. Moreover, the randomness and variability of moir\'e pattern generation pose challenges to the robustness of existing methods when applied to real-world data. To address these issues, this paper presents SIDME (Self-supervised Image Demoir\'eing via Masked Encoder-Decoder Reconstruction), a novel model designed to generate high-quality visual images by effectively processing moir\'e patterns. SIDME combines a masked encoder-decoder architecture with self-supervised learning, allowing the model to reconstruct images using the inherent properties of camera sampling frequencies. A key innovation is the random masked image reconstructor, which utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to handle the reconstruction task. Furthermore, since the green channel in camera sampling has a higher sampling frequency compared to red and blue channels, a specialized self-supervised loss function is designed to improve the training efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure the generalization ability of the model, a self-supervised moir\'e image generation method has been developed to produce a dataset that closely mimics real-world conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDME outperforms existing methods in processing real moir\'e pattern data, showing its superior generalization performance and robustness.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures | None |

Current methods, including those based on Visual Question Answering (VQA), still struggle with fine-grained assessments and precise quantification of image-text alignment. This paper presents an improved evaluation method named Instruction-augmented Multimodal Alignment for Image-Text and Element Matching (iMatch), which evaluates image-text semantic alignment by fine-tuning multimodal large language models.

Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures.

Extensive research in making T2I models produce hyper-realistic images has led to new concerns, such as generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) web content and polluting the web society. To help prevent misuse of T2I models and create a safer web environment for users features like NSFW filters and post-hoc security checks are used in these models. However, recent work unveiled how these methods can easily fail to prevent misuse. In particular, adversarial attacks on text and image modalities can easily outplay defensive measures. %Exploiting such leads to the growing concern of preventing adversarial attacks on text and image modalities. Moreover, there is currently no robust multimodal NSFW dataset that includes both prompt and image pairs and adversarial examples.

The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user feedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the alignment between user intent and model input. By evaluating generated outputs against user expectations, the Feedback-Reflection (FR) module identifies discrepancies and facilitates improvements. In an effort to ensure consistently high-quality results, the Adaptive Optimization (AO) module fine-tunes the generation process by balancing user preferences and maintaining prompt fidelity. Experimental results show that TDRI outperforms existing methods by achieving 33.6% human preference, compared to 6.2% for GPT-4 augmentation, and the highest CLIP and BLIP alignment scores (0.338 and 0.336, respectively). In iterative feedback tasks, user satisfaction increased to 88% after 8 rounds, with diminishing returns beyond 6 rounds. Furthermore, TDRI has been found to reduce the number of iterations and improve personalization in the creation of fashion products. TDRI exhibits a strong potential for a wide range of applications in the creative and industrial domains, as it streamlines the creative process and improves alignment with user preferences</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Allocation for Hybrid Bit and Generative Semantic Communications in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05647v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel framework consisting of hybrid bit-level and generative semantic communications for efficient downlink image transmission within space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). The proposed model comprises multiple low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground users. Considering the limitations in signal coverage and receiver antennas that make the direct communication between satellites and ground users unfeasible in many scenarios, thus UAVs serve as relays and forward images from satellites to the ground users. Our hybrid communication framework effectively combines bit-level transmission with several semantic-level image generation modes, optimizing bandwidth usage to meet stringent satellite link budget constraints and ensure communication reliability and low latency under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To reduce the transmission delay while ensuring reconstruction quality for the ground user, we propose a novel metric to measure delay and reconstruction quality in the proposed system, and employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to optimize resource allocation in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of communication resource conservation, reduced latency, and maintaining high image quality, significantly outperforming traditional solutions. Therefore, the proposed framework can ensure that real-time image transmission requirements in SAGINs, even under dynamic network conditions and user demand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications</p></details> | None |
| **[Aligning Generative Denoising with Discriminative Objectives Unleashes Diffusion for Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11457v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of image generation, generative diffusion models are increasingly adopted for discriminative tasks, as pixel generation provides a unified perception interface. However, directly repurposing the generative denoising process for discriminative objectives reveals critical gaps rarely addressed previously. Generative models tolerate intermediate sampling errors if the final distribution remains plausible, but discriminative tasks require rigorous accuracy throughout, as evidenced in challenging multi-modal tasks like referring image segmentation. Motivated by this gap, we analyze and enhance alignment between generative diffusion processes and perception tasks, focusing on how perception quality evolves during denoising. We find: (1) earlier denoising steps contribute disproportionately to perception quality, prompting us to propose tailored learning objectives reflecting varying timestep contributions; (2) later denoising steps show unexpected perception degradation, highlighting sensitivity to training-denoising distribution shifts, addressed by our diffusion-tailored data augmentation; and (3) generative processes uniquely enable interactivity, serving as controllable user interfaces adaptable to correctional prompts in multi-round interactions. Our insights significantly improve diffusion-based perception models without architectural changes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on depth estimation, referring image segmentation, and generalist perception tasks.

Recent advancements in GANs include 3D-aware models such as EG3D, which feature efficient triplane-based architectures capable of reconstructing 3D geometry from single images. However, limited attention has been given to providing an integrated framework for 3D-aware, high-quality, reference-based image editing. This study addresses this gap by exploring and demonstrating the effectiveness of the triplane space for advanced reference-based edits. Our novel approach integrates encoding, automatic localization, spatial disentanglement of triplane features, and fusion learning to achieve the desired edits. We demonstrate how our approach excels across diverse domains, including human faces, 360-degree heads, animal faces, partially stylized edits like cartoon faces, full-body clothing edits, and edits on class-agnostic samples. Our method shows state-of-the-art performance over relevant latent direction, text, and image-guided 2D and 3D-aware diffusion and GAN methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Highlight.

| **[ADT: Tuning Diffusion Models with Adversarial Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11423v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved outstanding image generation by reversing a forward noising process to approximate true data distributions. During training, these models predict diffusion scores from noised versions of true samples in a single forward pass, while inference requires iterative denoising starting from white noise. This training-inference divergences hinder the alignment between inference and training data distributions, due to potential prediction biases and cumulative error accumulation. To address this problem, we propose an intuitive but effective fine-tuning framework, called Adversarial Diffusion Tuning (ADT), by stimulating the inference process during optimization and aligning the final outputs with training data by adversarial supervision. Specifically, to achieve robust adversarial training, ADT features a siamese-network discriminator with a fixed pre-trained backbone and lightweight trainable parameters, incorporates an image-to-image sampling strategy to smooth discriminative difficulties, and preserves the original diffusion loss to prevent discriminator hacking. In addition, we carefully constrain the backward-flowing path for back-propagating gradients along the inference path without incurring memory overload or gradient explosion. Finally, extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion models (v1.5, XL, and v3), demonstrate that ADT significantly improves both distribution alignment and image quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Omni$^2$: Unifying Omnidirectional Image Generation and Editing in an Omni Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11379v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>$360^{\circ}$ omnidirectional images (ODIs) have gained considerable attention recently, and are widely used in various virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications. However, capturing such images is expensive and requires specialized equipment, making ODI synthesis increasingly important. While common 2D image generation and editing methods are rapidly advancing, these models struggle to deliver satisfactory results when generating or editing ODIs due to the unique format and broad 360$^{\circ}$ Field-of-View (FoV) of ODIs. To bridge this gap, we construct \textbf{\textit{Any2Omni}}, the first comprehensive ODI generation-editing dataset comprises 60,000+ training data covering diverse input conditions and up to 9 ODI generation and editing tasks. Built upon Any2Omni, we propose an \textbf{\underline{Omni}} model for \textbf{\underline{Omni}}-directional image generation and editing (\textbf{\textit{Omni$^2$}}), with the capability of handling various ODI generation and editing tasks under diverse input conditions using one model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed Omni$^2$ model for both the ODI generation and editing tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

We develop several technical improvements to address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to professional typography generation. In addition, it provides native high-resolution output (up to 2K), allowing it to generate images with high visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Seedr...</summary><p>Seedream 3.0 Technical Report</p></details> | None |

However, these models also face the risk of unsafe generation, potentially producing harmful content that violates usage policies, such as explicit material. Existing safe generation methods typically focus on suppressing inappropriate content by erasing undesired concepts from visual representations, while neglecting to sanitize the textual representation. Although these methods help mitigate the risk of misuse to some extent, their robustness remains insufficient when dealing with adversarial attacks. Given that semantic consistency between input text and output image is a core requirement of T2I models, we identify that textual representations are likely the primary source of unsafe generation. To this end, we propose Embedding Sanitizer (ES), which enhances the safety of T2I models by sanitizing inappropriate concepts in prompt embeddings. To our knowledge, ES is the first interpretable safe generation framework that assigns a score to each token in the prompt to indicate its potential harmfulness. In addition, ES adopts a plug-and-play modular design, offering compatibility for seamless integration with various T2I models and other safeguards. Evaluations on five prompt benchmarks show that ES outperforms eleven existing safeguard baselines, achieving state-of-the-art robustness while maintaining high-quality image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Using LLMs as prompt modifier to avoid biases in AI image generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11104v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can reduce biases in text-to-image generation systems by modifying user prompts. We define bias as a model's unfair deviation from population statistics given neutral prompts. Our experiments with Stable Diffusion XL, 3.5 and Flux demonstrate that LLM-modified prompts significantly increase image diversity and reduce bias without the need to change the image generators themselves. While occasionally producing results that diverge from original user intent for elaborate prompts, this approach generally provides more varied interpretations of underspecified requests rather than superficial variations. The method works particularly well for less advanced image generators, though limitations persist for certain contexts like disability representation.

| **[AnimeDL-2M: Million-Scale AI-Generated Anime Image Detection and Localization in Diffusion Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11015v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image generation, particularly diffusion models, have significantly lowered the barrier for creating sophisticated forgeries, making image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) increasingly challenging. While prior work in IMDL has focused largely on natural images, the anime domain remains underexplored-despite its growing vulnerability to AI-generated forgeries. Misrepresentations of AI-generated images as hand-drawn artwork, copyright violations, and inappropriate content modifications pose serious threats to the anime community and industry. To address this gap, we propose AnimeDL-2M, the first large-scale benchmark for anime IMDL with comprehensive annotations. It comprises over two million images including real, partially manipulated, and fully AI-generated samples. Experiments indicate that models trained on existing IMDL datasets of natural images perform poorly when applied to anime images, highlighting a clear domain gap between anime and natural images. To better handle IMDL tasks in anime domain, we further propose AniXplore, a novel model tailored to the visual characteristics of anime imagery. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AniXplore achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

| **[Bringing together invertible UNets with invertible attention modules for memory-efficient diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10883v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained state of the art performance on many image generation tasks. However, most models require significant computational resources to achieve this. This becomes apparent in the application of medical image synthesis due to the 3D nature of medical datasets like CT-scans, MRIs, electron microscope, etc. In this paper we propose a novel architecture for a single GPU memory-efficient training for diffusion models for high dimensional medical datasets. The proposed model is built by using an invertible UNet architecture with invertible attention modules. This leads to the following two contributions: 1. denoising diffusion models and thus enabling memory usage to be independent of the dimensionality of the dataset, and 2. reducing the energy usage during training. While this new model can be applied to a multitude of image generation tasks, we showcase its memory-efficiency on the 3D BraTS2020 dataset leading to up to 15\% decrease in peak memory consumption during training with comparable results to SOTA while maintaining the image quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Art3D: Training-Free 3D Generation from Flat-Colored Illustration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10466v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained image-to-3D generative models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse shape generations. However, most of them struggle to synthesize plausible 3D assets when the reference image is flat-colored like hand drawings due to the lack of 3D illusion, which are often the most user-friendly input modalities in art content creation. To this end, we propose Art3D, a training-free method that can lift flat-colored 2D designs into 3D. By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D image generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully enhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying the process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of painting styles. To benchmark the generalization performance of existing image-to-3D models on flat-colored images without 3D feeling, we collect a new dataset, Flat-2D, with over 100 samples. Experimental results demonstrate the performance and robustness of Art3D, exhibiting superior generalizable capacity and promising practical applicability.

| **[Anchor Token Matching: Implicit Structure Locking for Training-free AR Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10434v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has seen groundbreaking advancements with diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity synthesis and precise image editing through cross-attention manipulation. Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have re-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match diffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion models fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences in structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of attention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image editing, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we introduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing strategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention manipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by dynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the Anchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural consistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing while maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional training and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our findings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing, further bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive generative models.

Existing methods face certain limitations in terms of both data and algorithm. For training data, most approaches rely on manual annotated preference data, either by directly fine-tuning the generators or by training reward models to provide training signals. However, the high annotation cost makes them difficult to scale up, the reward model consumes extra computation and cannot guarantee accuracy. From an algorithmic perspective, most methods neglect the value of text and only take the image feedback as a comparative signal, which is inefficient and sparse. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose the InstructEngine framework. Regarding annotation cost, we first construct a taxonomy for text-to-image generation, then develop an automated data construction pipeline based on it. Leveraging advanced large multimodal models and human-defined rules, we generate 25K text-image preference pairs. Finally, we introduce cross-validation alignment method, which refines data efficiency by organizing semantically analogous samples into mutually comparable pairs. Evaluations on DrawBench demonstrate that InstructEngine improves SD v1.5 and SDXL's performance by 10.53% and 5.30%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation study confirming the benefits of InstructEngine's all components. A win rate of over 50% in human reviews also proves that InstructEngine better aligns with human preferences.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

In this paper, we introduce RHanDS, a conditional diffusion-based framework designed to refine malformed hands by utilizing decoupled structure and style guidance. The hand mesh reconstructed from the malformed hand offers structure guidance for correcting the structure of the hand, while the malformed hand itself provides style guidance for preserving the style of the hand. To alleviate the mutual interference between style and structure guidance, we introduce a two-stage training strategy and build a series of multi-style hand datasets. In the first stage, we use paired hand images for training to ensure stylistic consistency in hand refining. In the second stage, various hand images generated based on human meshes are used for training, enabling the model to gain control over the hand structure. Experimental results demonstrate that RHanDS can effectively refine hand structure while preserving consistency in hand style.</p></details> |  | None |

They are poorly understood and suffer from strong biases inherited from the training sets. One way to address these shortcomings is to have a better control over the training sets, in particular by using synthetic sets. In this paper, we propose a synthetic image generator relying on a few simple principles. In particular, we focus on geometric modeling, textures, and a simple modeling of image acquisition. These properties, integrated in a classical Dead Leaves model, enable the creation of efficient training sets. Standard image denoising and super-resolution networks can be trained on such datasets, reaching performance almost on par with training on natural image datasets. As a first step towards explainability, we provide a careful analysis of the considered principles, identifying which image properties are necessary to obtain good performances. Besides, such training also yields better robustness to various geometric and radiometric perturbations of the test sets.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper contributes a ChatGPT-Prompted visual hallucination evaluation Dataset (PhD) for objective VHE at a large scale. The essence of VHE is to ask an MLLM questions about specific images to assess its susceptibility to hallucination. Depending on what to ask (objects, attributes, sentiment, etc.) and how the questions are asked, we structure PhD along two dimensions, i.e. task and mode. Five visual recognition tasks, ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting), are considered. Besides a normal visual QA mode, which we term PhD-base, PhD also asks questions with specious context (PhD-sec) or with incorrect context ({PhD-icc), or with AI-generated counter common sense images (PhD-ccs). We construct PhD by a ChatGPT-assisted semi-automated pipeline, encompassing four pivotal modules: task-specific hallucinatory item (hitem) selection, hitem-embedded question generation, specious / incorrect context generation, and counter-common-sense (CCS) image generation. With over 14k daily images, 750 CCS images and 102k VQA triplets in total, PhD reveals considerable variability in MLLMs' performance across various modes and tasks, offering valuable insights into the nature of hallucination. As such, PhD stands as a potent tool not only for VHE but may also play a significant role in the refinement of MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025, Highlight</p></details> | None |

Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.</p></details> |  | None |
