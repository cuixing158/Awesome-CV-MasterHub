As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of $O(N^2)$, compared to $O(N)$ for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs almost no end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

| **[Beyond Content: How Grammatical Gender Shapes Visual Representation in Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03199v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models. Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73% on average (compared to 22% with gender-neutral English), while feminine grammatical markers increase female representation to 38% (compared to 28% in English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects. Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Imagining Alternatives: Towards High-Resolution 3D Counterfactual Medical Image Generation via Language Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05978v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however, the success of these models is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language remains unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a step toward this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied to neurological imaging, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential. On two neurological MRI datasets, our framework simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis in 3D medical imaging.

| **[Text-to-CT Generation via 3D Latent Diffusion Model with Contrastive Vision-Language Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00633v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: While recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have enabled the synthesis of realistic medical images, progress has been largely confined to 2D modalities such as chest X-rays. Extending text-to-image generation to volumetric CT remains a significant challenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the absence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical imaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation that combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language pretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model trained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared embedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT volumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained volumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring external super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the CT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity, clinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for text-to-CT generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CT scans synthesized by our framework can effectively augment real data, improving downstream diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Our results show that modality-specific vision-language alignment is a key component for high-quality 3D medical image generation. By integrating contrastive pretraining and volumetric diffusion, our method offers a scalable and controllable solution for synthesizing clinically meaningful CT volumes from text, paving the way for new applications in data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation.

| **[Query-Kontext: An Unified Multimodal Model for Image Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26641v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM) with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism. Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods in several cases.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[On Fitting Flow Models with Large Sinkhorn Couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05526v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and $n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs. These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a. Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[HilbertA: Hilbert Attention for Image Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26538v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region. Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of $2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at $2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Post-Training Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26436v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in 4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations, leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression (QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Go with Your Gut: Scaling Confidence for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26376v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP) autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i) Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3) successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in challenging scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/EnVision-Research/ScalingAR</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/EnVision-Research/ScalingAR) |
| **[EVODiff: Entropy-aware Variance Optimized Diffusion Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26096v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

| **[Taming the Tri-Space Tension: ARC-Guided Hallucination Modeling and Control for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04946v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent "hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the Hallucination Tri-Space and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,6 figures,7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Exact Solutions to the Quantum Schrödinger Bridge Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25980v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that, similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions, we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework, and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings, including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation and applications in Mean-Field Games.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose KDC-Diff, a novel and scalable generative framework designed to significantly reduce computational overhead while maintaining high performance. At its core, KDC-Diff designs a structurally streamlined U-Net with a dual-layered knowledge distillation strategy to transfer semantic and structural representations from a larger teacher model. Moreover, a latent-space replay-based continual learning mechanism is incorporated to ensure stable generative performance across sequential tasks. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, our model demonstrates strong performance across FID, CLIP, KID, and LPIPS metrics while achieving substantial reductions in parameter count, inference time, and FLOPs. KDC-Diff offers a practical, lightweight, and generalizable solution for deploying diffusion models in low-resource environments, making it well-suited for the next generation of intelligent and resource-aware computing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently Under Review at IEEE open journal for Computer Society</p></details> | None |
| **[Teaching Metric Distance to Discrete Autoregressive Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02379v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models expand beyond natural language to domains such as mathematics, multimodal understanding, and embodied agents, tokens increasingly reflect metric relationships rather than purely linguistic meaning. We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are most notable in low-data regimes, demonstrating DIST2Loss's strength under resource constraints.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25774v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image (T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process, leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality. The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.</p></details> | 24 pages, 17 figures | None |
| **[How Diffusion Models Memorize](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i) memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together, these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism of memorization in diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feature Space Analysis by Guided Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07936v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains, this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various image attributes are encoded into the user-specified feature. Our decoder is implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature. One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into these DNNs' feature spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 13 figures, codes: https://github.com/KimiakiShirahama/FeatureSpaceAnalysisByGuidedDiffusionModel</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/KimiakiShirahama/FeatureSpaceAnalysisByGuidedDiffusionModel) |
| **[IRIS: Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25562v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This erodes trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generated image detectors that remain reliable across different generators. While recent approaches leverage diffusion denoising cues, they typically rely on single-step reconstruction errors and overlook the sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - LATent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across multiple denoising steps. Instead of treating each denoising step in isolation, LATTE captures the trajectory of these representations, revealing subtle and discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Experiments on several benchmarks, such as GenImage, Chameleon, and Diffusion Forensics, show that LATTE achieves superior performance, especially in challenging cross-generator and cross-dataset scenarios, highlighting the potential of latent trajectory modeling.

| **[MixGRPO: Unlocking Flow-based GRPO Efficiency with Mixed ODE-SDE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21802v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%.

This paper presents a large-scale study on gender bias in text-to-image (T2I) models, focusing on everyday situations. While previous research has examined biases in occupations, we extend this analysis to gender associations in daily activities, objects, and contexts. We create a dataset of 3,217 gender-neutral prompts and generate 200 images over 5 prompt variations per prompt from five leading T2I models. We automatically detect the perceived gender of people in the generated images and filter out images with no person or multiple people of different genders, leaving 2,293,295 images. To enable a broad analysis of gender bias in T2I models, we group prompts into semantically similar concepts and calculate the proportion of male- and female-gendered images for each prompt. Our analysis shows that T2I models reinforce traditional gender roles and reflect common gender stereotypes in household roles. Women are predominantly portrayed in care and human-centered scenarios, and men in technical or physical labor scenarios.</p></details> | 40 pages | None |
| **[DC-Gen: Post-Training Diffusion Acceleration with Deeply Compressed Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25180v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup. Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a 4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model.

| **[GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25178v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GLASS Flows: Transition Sampling for Alignment of Flow and Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25170v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Aligning Visual Foundation Encoders to Tokenizers for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25162v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of 1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aligntok.github.io/</p></details> | None |

While AR models have achieved transformative success in language modeling, replicating this success in vision tasks has presented unique challenges due to inherent spatial dependencies in images. Addressing the unique challenges of vision tasks, our method (CART) adds image details iteratively via semantically meaningful decompositions. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of CART by applying it across three distinct decomposition strategies: (i) Base-Detail Decomposition (Mumford-Shah smoothness), (ii) Intrinsic Decomposition (albedo/shading), and (iii) Specularity Decomposition (diffuse/specular). This "next-detail" strategy outperforms traditional "next-token" and "next-scale" approaches, improving controllability, semantic interpretability, and resolution scalability. Experiments show CART generates visually compelling results while enabling structured image manipulation, opening new directions for controllable generative modeling via physically or perceptually motivated image factorization.</p></details> | <details><summary>figur...</summary><p>figures compressed to meet arxiv size limit</p></details> | None |
| **[GSM8K-V: Can Vision Language Models Solve Grade School Math Word Problems in Visual Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25160v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text, enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception, planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently, numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation, we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement. GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and generalizable VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>68 pa...</summary><p>68 pages, 6 figures, Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/GSM8K-V Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/GSM8K-V Datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZJU-REAL/GSM8K-V</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/GSM8K-V) |
| **[Differentiable Expectation-Maximisation and Applications to Gaussian Mixture Model Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02109v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$ between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and texture synthesis illustrate the versatility of the proposed approach in different settings.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose LayerD, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into layers for re-editable creative workflow. LayerD addresses the decomposition task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In experiments, we show that LayerD successfully achieves high-quality decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of LayerD with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project page: https://cyberagentailab.github.io/LayerD/ , GitHub: https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/LayerD</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/LayerD) |
| **[Score Distillation of Flow Matching Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25127v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one- or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[STAGE: Stable and Generalizable GRPO for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25027v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work, we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues: contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting. Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task generalization compared to baseline GRPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/krennic999/STAGE</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/krennic999/STAGE) |
| **[FRABench and UFEval: Unified Fine-grained Evaluation with Task and Aspect Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12795v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating open-ended outputs of Multimodal Large Language Models has become a bottleneck as model capabilities, task diversity, and modality rapidly expand. Existing ``MLLM-as-a-Judge'' evaluators, though promising, remain constrained to specific tasks and aspects. In this paper, we argue that, on one hand, based on the interconnected nature of aspects, learning specific aspects can generalize to unseen aspects; on the other hand, jointly learning to assess multiple visual aspects and tasks may foster a synergistic effect. To this end, we propose UFEval, the first unified fine-grained evaluator with task and aspect generalization for four evaluation tasks -- Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. However, training such a unified evaluator is hindered by the lack of a large-scale, multi-modal, and aspect-level resource. To address this gap, we introduce FRABench, a comprehensive fine-grained evaluation dataset. Specifically, (1) We first construct a hierarchical aspect taxonomy encompassing 112 distinct aspects across the aforementioned four tasks. (2) Based on this taxonomy, we create FRABench, comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k evaluation labels obtained from a combination of human and GPT-4o annotations. (3) Finally, leveraging FRABench, we develop UFEval, a unified fine-grained evaluator. Experiments show that learning on specific aspects enables UFEval to generalize to unseen aspects, and joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks and aspects can lead to substantial mutual benefits.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Segmentor-Guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning for Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24913v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising results for modeling coronary artery disease.

While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks, with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Origins of Creativity in Attention-Based Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17324v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how `creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g., (Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process. However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself (translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise `mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RealUnify: Do Unified Models Truly Benefit from Unification? A Comprehensive Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24897v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI. However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy. RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10 categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1) Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense, logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding, which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the potential of unified modeling.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VAGUEGAN: Stealthy Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on Image Generative Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24891v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied, attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Environment-Aware Satellite Image Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24875v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals: a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge, the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different mediums.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 26 figures | None |

Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects. RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, running 4.8 times faster than naive reward-agnostic test-time search baseline on average. Furthermore, with sufficient inference budget, it can achieve comparable performance to learning-based baselines that require reward-specific fine-tuning.

SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s (T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s (T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for AI-powered consumer applications (AIPC).

Yet leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity. We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments diffusion models with a register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation. We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision. Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative, scientific, and practical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, overlap with arXiv:2507.20855 and arXiv:2501.15878</p></details> | None |

LoRACLR uses a contrastive objective to align and merge the weight spaces of these models, ensuring compatibility while minimizing interference. By enforcing distinct yet cohesive representations for each concept, LoRACLR enables efficient, scalable model composition for high-quality, multi-concept image synthesis.

However, these attributions also hinder the practical deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application. Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search. We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup.

| **[Uni-X: Mitigating Modality Conflict with a Two-End-Separated Architecture for Unified Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24365v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR) transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs, modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture. Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing, while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for future unified multimodal modeling.

| **[Hyperspherical Latents Improve Continuous-Token Autoregressive Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24335v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG), and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG -- to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models, achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54 and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge, this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter scales.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cycle Diffusion Model for Counterfactual Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24267v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints, enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation, counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaling Diffusion Transformers Efficiently via $μ$P](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15270v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector for Image Forgery Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12341v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods.

This paper introduces GANji, a lightweight framework for benchmarking foundational AI image generation techniques using a dataset of 10,314 Japanese Kanji characters. It systematically compares the performance of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). The results demonstrate that while the DDPM achieves the highest image fidelity, with a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score of 26.2, its sampling time is over 2,000 times slower than the other models. The GANji framework is an effective and accessible tool for revealing the fundamental trade-offs between model architecture, computational cost, and visual quality, making it ideal for both educational and research purposes.</p></details> |  | None |

The achievement of HunyuanImage 3.0 relies on several key components, including meticulous data curation, advanced architecture design, a native Chain-of-Thoughts schema, progressive model pre-training, aggressive model post-training, and an efficient infrastructure that enables large-scale training and inference. With these advancements, we successfully trained a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model comprising over 80 billion parameters in total, with 13 billion parameters activated per token during inference, making it the largest and most powerful open-source image generative model to date. We conducted extensive experiments and the results of automatic and human evaluation of text-image alignment and visual quality demonstrate that HunyuanImage 3.0 rivals previous state-of-the-art models. By releasing the code and weights of HunyuanImage 3.0, we aim to enable the community to explore new ideas with a state-of-the-art foundation model, fostering a dynamic and vibrant multimodal ecosystem.

| **[Not All Tokens are Guided Equal: Improving Guidance in Visual Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23876v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Representation Entanglement for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Much Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01467v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models, through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\% increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively, SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer).

| **[Leveraging BEV Paradigm for Ground-to-Aerial Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01812v5)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground-to-aerial image synthesis focuses on generating realistic aerial images from corresponding ground street view images while maintaining consistent content layout, simulating a top-down view. The significant viewpoint difference leads to domain gaps between views, and dense urban scenes limit the visible range of street views, making this cross-view generation task particularly challenging. In this paper, we introduce SkyDiffusion, a novel cross-view generation method for synthesizing aerial images from street view images, utilizing a diffusion model and the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) paradigm. The Curved-BEV method in SkyDiffusion converts street-view images into a BEV perspective, effectively bridging the domain gap, and employs a "multi-to-one" mapping strategy to address occlusion issues in dense urban scenes. Next, SkyDiffusion designed a BEV-guided diffusion model to generate content-consistent and realistic aerial images. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, Ground2Aerial-3, designed for diverse ground-to-aerial image synthesis applications, including disaster scene aerial synthesis, low-altitude UAV image synthesis, and historical high-resolution satellite image synthesis tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SkyDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-view datasets across natural (CVUSA), suburban (CVACT), urban (VIGOR-Chicago), and various application scenarios (G2A-3), achieving realistic and content-consistent aerial image generation.

These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Continuous Speculative Decoding for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11925v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous visual autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated promising performance in image generation. However, the heavy autoregressive inference burden imposes significant overhead. In Large Language Models (LLMs), speculative decoding has effectively accelerated discrete autoregressive inference. However, the absence of an analogous theory for continuous distributions precludes its use in accelerating continuous AR models. To fill this gap, this work presents continuous speculative decoding, and addresses challenges from: 1) low acceptance rate, caused by inconsistent output distribution between target and draft models, and 2) modified distribution without analytic expression, caused by complex integral. To address challenge 1), we propose denoising trajectory alignment and token pre-filling strategies. To address challenge 2), we introduce acceptance-rejection sampling algorithm with an appropriate upper bound, thereby avoiding explicitly calculating the integral. Furthermore, our denoising trajectory alignment is also reused in acceptance-rejection sampling, effectively avoiding repetitive diffusion model inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed continuous speculative decoding achieves over $2\times$ speedup on off-the-shelf models, while maintaining the original generation quality.

This is realized through two key designs: (1) multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details. Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a 27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space. Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AudioMoG: Guiding Audio Generation with Mixture-of-Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23727v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance methods have demonstrated significant improvements in cross-modal audio generation, including text-to-audio (T2A) and video-to-audio (V2A) generation. The popularly adopted method, classifier-free guidance (CFG), steers generation by emphasizing condition alignment, enhancing fidelity but often at the cost of diversity. Recently, autoguidance (AG) has been explored for audio generation, encouraging the sampling to faithfully reconstruct the target distribution and showing increased diversity. Despite these advances, they usually rely on a single guiding principle, e.g., condition alignment in CFG or score accuracy in AG, leaving the full potential of guidance for audio generation untapped. In this work, we explore enriching the composition of the guidance method and present a mixture-of-guidance framework, AudioMoG. Within the design space, AudioMoG can exploit the complementary advantages of distinctive guiding principles by fulfilling their cumulative benefits. With a reduced form, AudioMoG can consider parallel complements or recover a single guiding principle, without sacrificing generality. We experimentally show that, given the same inference speed, AudioMoG approach consistently outperforms single guidance in T2A generation across sampling steps, concurrently showing advantages in V2A, text-to-music, and image generation. These results highlight a "free lunch" in current cross-modal audio generation systems: higher quality can be achieved through mixed guiding principles at the sampling stage without sacrificing inference efficiency.

| **[Score Replacement with Bounded Deviation for Rare Prompt Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20808v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models achieve impressive performance in high-fidelity image generation but often struggle with rare concepts that appear infrequently in the training distribution. Prior work attempts to address this issue by prompt switching, where generation begins with a frequent proxy prompt and later transitions to the original rare prompt. However, such designs typically rely on fixed schedules that disregard the model's internal dynamics, making them brittle across prompts and backbones. In this paper, we re-frame rare prompt generation through the lens of score replacement: the denoising trajectory of a rare prompt can be initially guided by the score of a semantically related frequent prompt, which acts as a proxy. However, as the process unfolds, the proxy score gradually diverges from the true rare prompt score. To control this drift, we introduce a bounded deviation criterion that triggers the switch once the deviation exceeds a threshold. This formulation offers both a principled justification and a practical mechanism for rare prompt generation, enabling adaptive switching that can be widely adopted by different models. Extensive experiments across SDXL, SD3, Flux, and Sana confirm that our method consistently improves rare concept synthesis, outperforming strong baselines in both automated metrics and human evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a set of desirable properties to define the representation structure of a neural network for image generation, including feature completeness, spatial boundedness and consistency. These properties enable us to propose a method for disentangling primitive feature components from the intermediate-layer features, where each feature component generates a primitive regional pattern covering multiple image patches. In this way, the generation of the entire image can be explained as a superposition of these feature components. We prove that these feature components, which satisfy the feature completeness property and the linear additivity property (derived from the feature completeness, spatial boundedness, and consistency properties), can be computed as OR Harsanyi interaction. Experiments have verified the faithfulness of the disentangled primitive regional patterns.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene, which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background. Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely align with text prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 15 figures, Project page: https://xdlbw.github.io/ZeroScene/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://xdlbw.github.io/ZeroScene) |

Existing methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation, where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising, inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic consistency, and human-rated creativity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular, forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks, while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures | None |

However, their practical deployment is hindered by substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits.

Test-time optimization has emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts. This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the large language model to propose improved prompts.

Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are designed to ascertain whether specific data were utilized during a model's training phase. As current MIAs for diffusion models typically exploit the model's image prediction ability, we formalize them into a unified general paradigm which computes the membership score for membership identification. Under this paradigm, we empirically find that existing attacks overlook the inherent deficiency in how diffusion models process high-frequency information. Consequently, this deficiency leads to member data with more high-frequency content being misclassified as hold-out data, and hold-out data with less high-frequency content tend to be misclassified as member data. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that this deficiency reduces the membership advantage of attacks, thereby interfering with the effective discrimination of member data and hold-out data. Based on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play high-frequency filter module to mitigate the adverse effects of the deficiency, which can be seamlessly integrated into any attacks within this general paradigm without additional time costs. Extensive experiments corroborate that this module significantly improves the performance of baseline attacks across different datasets and models.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior defenses such as I2VGuard attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against misuse of I2V generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICASSP 26 4 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

This limitation becomes particularly critical in practical applications such as advertising and marketing, where preserving the identity of featured individuals is essential for a campaign's effectiveness. It is particularly severe when subjects are distant from the camera or appear within a group, frequently leading to a significant loss of identity. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized image synthesis. Key contributions include the "Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, which significantly enhances identity retention in complex scenes, and a training-free content consistency loss that improves the preservation of fine-grained details by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially exceeds the baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust identity integrity, all without necessitating model retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code, datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this field.

Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It introduces vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pre-training strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released upon paper acceptance</p></details> | None |
| **[Stochastic Interpolants via Conditional Dependent Coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23122v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost. Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization. Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these approaches neglect the causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0 model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0 achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58 percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI 2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training, reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution. Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen), Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement, along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in the retrieval and further contributes to generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT, Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update. The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a unified model.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains. Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images, significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation performance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures | None |

Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image generation by earlier methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation. Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image, generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages,13 figures,7 tables</p></details> | None |

To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps (instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with higher fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces. We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+ layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains (AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable manner.

In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.</p></details> |  | None |

While diffusion model backbones are known to encode semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for advancing this task.

However, existing methods, particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore, we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios. Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wutao-cs.github.io/MultiCrafter/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wutao-cs.github.io/MultiCrafter) |

When modeling discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However, such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model, leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model.

| **[Deepfakes: we need to re-think the concept of "real" images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21864v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current "fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake" images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Through detailed exploration, we offer a suite of ready-to-use solutions, ranging from linear attention design to optimization strategies. Our core contributions include 5 practical guidelines: 1) Applying depth-wise convolution within simple linear attention is sufficient for image generation. 2) Using fewer heads in linear attention provides a free-lunch performance boost without increasing latency. 3) Inheriting weights from a fully converged, pre-trained DiT. 4) Loading all parameters except those related to linear attention. 5) Hybrid knowledge distillation: using a pre-trained teacher DiT to help the training of the student linear DiT, supervising not only the predicted noise but also the variance of the reverse diffusion process. These guidelines lead to our proposed \underline{L}inear D\underline{i}ffusion \underline{T}ransformer (LiT), which serves as a safe and efficient alternative baseline for DiT with pure linear attention. In class-conditional 256$\times$256 and 512$\times$512 ImageNet generation, LiT can be quickly adapted from DiT using only $20\%$ and $33\%$ of DiT's training steps, respectively, while achieving comparable performance. LiT also rivals methods based on Mamba or Gated Linear Attention. Moreover, the same guidelines generalize to text-to-image generation: LiT can be swiftly converted from PixArt-$\Sigma$ to generate high-quality images, maintaining comparable GenEval scores.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures | None |

Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases.

However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o, which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision reward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>[Acce...</summary><p>[Accepted by NeurIPS2025] Project Page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/think</p></details> | [Code Link](https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward) |
| **[Language Models Can Learn from Verbal Feedback Without Scalar Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22638v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy) |
| **[Transport Based Mean Flows for Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22592v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation, and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UniMIC: Token-Based Multimodal Interactive Coding for Human-AI Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22570v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression, lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for next-generation multimodal interactive communication.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps. We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with significantly reduced computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/zghhui/GCPO</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/zghhui/GCPO) |

In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy. Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.</p></details> |  | None |

Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

Evaluation in this space relies heavily on automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation. Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment. These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models in generation.

| **[Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10568v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only 32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and a 75 percent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Unwinnable Arms Race of AI Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21135v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The generative reverse process is derandomized by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics, which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure | None |

To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2) decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies (LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22 generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables, accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error for Detecting AI-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09487v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, AI-generated image detection has gained increasing attention, as the rapid advancement of image generation technologies has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models, since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts and thus overfit to the models used for training. To address this limitation, we propose a novel representation, namely Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The key hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images, which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE provides a robust and discriminative feature for detecting fake images across diverse generative models. Additionally, we introduce a fusion module that integrates SARE into the backbone detector via a cross-attention mechanism. Image features attend to semantic representations extracted from SARE, enabling the model to adaptively leverage semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong generalization, outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and ForenSynths. We further validate the effectiveness of caption guidance through a detailed analysis of semantic shifts, confirming its ability to enhance detection robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose \textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information. Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled, style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Training-Free Layout-to-Image Generation with Marginal Attention Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10495v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-resolution images from text but struggle with precise control over spatial composition and object counting. To address these challenges, prior works developed layout-to-image (L2I) approaches that incorporate layout instructions into text-to-image models. However, existing L2I methods typically require fine-tuning of pre-trained parameters or training additional control modules for the diffusion models. In this work, we propose a training-free L2I approach, MAC (Marginal Attention Constrained Generation), which eliminates the need for additional modules or fine-tuning. Specifically, we use text-visual cross-attention feature maps to quantify inconsistencies between the layout of the generated images and the provided instructions, and then compute loss functions to optimize latent features during the diffusion reverse process. To enhance spatial controllability and mitigate semantic failures in complex layout instructions, we leverage pixel-to-pixel correlations in the self-attention feature maps to align cross-attention maps and combine three loss functions constrained by boundary attention to update latent features. Comprehensive experimental results on both L2I and non-L2I pretrained diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing training-free L2I techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of image composition on the DrawBench and HRS benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

The approach is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL) stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image generation.

While the input modality (photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image, NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50 apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, submitted for ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[LayoutAgent: A Vision-Language Agent Guided Compositional Diffusion for Spatial Layout Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22720v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images, but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning, leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency, but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation. Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on SPACE in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI</p></details> | None |

A computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve). InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask, and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> | None |

We develop a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g., 1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image (without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream 4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images. This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications.

While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore, we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.</p></details> |  | None |

The primary obstacle is that the explicit positional encodings(PE), such as RoPE, need extrapolating to unseen positions which degrades performance when the inference resolution differs from training. In this paper, We propose a Length-Extrapolatable Diffusion Transformer~(LEDiT) to overcome this limitation. LEDiT needs no explicit PEs, thereby avoiding PE extrapolation. The key innovation of LEDiT lies in the use of causal attention. We demonstrate that causal attention can implicitly encode global positional information and show that such information facilitates extrapolation. We further introduce a locality enhancement module, which captures fine-grained local information to complement the global coarse-grained position information encoded by causal attention. Experimental results on both conditional and text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that LEDiT supports up to 4x resolution scaling (e.g., from 256x256 to 512x512), achieving better image quality compared to the state-of-the-art length extrapolation methods. We believe that LEDiT marks a departure from the standard RoPE-based methods and offers a promising insight into length extrapolation.

Existing approaches often compromise biological plausibility by entirely avoiding the use of spikes for error propagation or relying on both positive and negative learning signals, while the question of how spikes can represent negative values remains unresolved. To address these limitations, we introduce Bidirectional Spike-based Distillation (BSD), a novel learning algorithm that jointly trains a feedforward and a backward spiking network. We formulate learning as a transformation between two spiking representations (i.e., stimulus encoding and concept encoding) so that the feedforward network implements perception and decision-making by mapping stimuli to actions, while the backward network supports memory recall by reconstructing stimuli from concept representations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including image recognition, image generation, and sequential regression, show that BSD achieves performance comparable to networks trained with classical error backpropagation. These findings represent a significant step toward biologically grounded, spike-driven learning in neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learnable Sampler Distillation for Discrete Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19962v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps.

Unlike existing multimodal MDMs such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O presents a single framework that enables image-level understanding, object grounding, image editing, and high-resolution (1024px) text-to-image synthesis. Lavida-O incorporates a novel Elastic Mixture-of-Transformers (Elastic-MoT) architecture that couples a lightweight generation branch with a larger understanding branch, supported by token compression, universal text conditioning and stratified sampling for efficient and high-quality generation. Lavida-O further incorporates planning and iterative self-reflection in image generation and editing tasks, seamlessly boosting generation quality with its understanding capabilities. Lavida-O achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks including RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive models and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference.

However, their safety and robustness against adversarial attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions, potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%, significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

A widely adopted approach is identifying "metamers," stimuli physically different yet perceptually equivalent within a system. However, conventional methods lack a direct approach to searching for the human metameric space. Instead, researchers first develop biologically inspired models and then infer about human metamers indirectly by testing whether model metamers also appear as metamers to humans. Here, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Metamer Exploration (MAME) framework, enabling direct, high-dimensional exploration of human metameric spaces through online image generation guided by human perceptual feedback. MAME modulates reference images across multiple dimensions based on hierarchical neural network responses, adaptively updating generation parameters according to participants' perceptual discriminability. Using MAME, we successfully measured multidimensional human metameric spaces within a single psychophysical experiment. Experimental results using a biologically plausible CNN model showed that human discrimination sensitivity was lower for metameric images based on low-level features compared to high-level features, which image contrast metrics could not explain. The finding suggests a relatively worse alignment between the metameric spaces of humans and the CNN model for low-level processing compared to high-level processing. Counterintuitively, given recent discussions on alignment at higher representational levels, our results highlight the importance of early visual computations in shaping biologically plausible models. Our MAME framework can serve as a future scientific tool for directly investigating the functional organization of human vision.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures | None |

While classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategies have shown promising results in image generation, their application to speech synthesis are underexplored. Separating the conditions used for CFG enables trade-offs between different desired characteristics in speech synthesis. In this paper, we evaluate the adaptability of CFG strategies originally developed for image generation to speech synthesis and extend separated-condition CFG approaches for this domain. Our results show that CFG strategies effective in image generation generally fail to improve speech synthesis. We also find that we can improve speaker similarity while limiting degradation of text adherence by applying standard CFG during early timesteps and switching to selective CFG only in later timesteps. Surprisingly, we observe that the effectiveness of a selective CFG strategy is highly text-representation dependent, as differences between the two languages of English and Mandarin can lead to different results even with the same model.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts, and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>text-...</summary><p>text-to-image generation, automatic prompt, DPO, Counterfactual</p></details> | None |

These detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to WACV</p></details> | None |

We identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2) overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a curated amodal mask dataset.

However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a 22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

While diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and $2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$.

However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. Through extensive experimentation, we first demonstrate that MediSyn quantitatively matches or surpasses the performance of specialist models. Second, we show that our synthetic images are realistic and exhibit strong alignment with their corresponding text prompts, as validated by a team of expert physicians. Third, we provide empirical evidence that our synthetic images are visually distinct from their corresponding real patient images. Finally, we demonstrate that in data-limited settings, classifiers trained solely on synthetic data or real data supplemented with synthetic data can outperform those trained solely on real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential of generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG), which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step, gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark.

While advancements have been made in expediting the sampling process, the underlying architectural inefficiencies within DiT remain underexplored. We introduce SparseDiT, a novel framework that implements token sparsification across spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance computational efficiency while preserving generative quality. Spatially, SparseDiT employs a tri-segment architecture that allocates token density based on feature requirements at each layer: Poolingformer in the bottom layers for efficient global feature extraction, Sparse-Dense Token Modules (SDTM) in the middle layers to balance global context with local detail, and dense tokens in the top layers to refine high-frequency details. Temporally, SparseDiT dynamically modulates token density across denoising stages, progressively increasing token count as finer details emerge in later timesteps. This synergy between SparseDiT spatially adaptive architecture and its temporal pruning strategy enables a unified framework that balances efficiency and fidelity throughout the generation process. Our experiments demonstrate SparseDiT effectiveness, achieving a 55% reduction in FLOPs and a 175% improvement in inference speed on DiT-XL with similar FID score on 512x512 ImageNet, a 56% reduction in FLOPs across video generation datasets, and a 69% improvement in inference speed on PixArt-$\alpha$ on text-to-image generation task with a 0.24 FID score decrease.

Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods.

| **[Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common assumption in probabilistic generative models for image generation is that learning the global data distribution suffices to generate novel images via sampling. We investigate the limitation of this core assumption, namely that learning global distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability Space (MEPS) and the Local Dependence Hypothesis (LDH), for investigation. MEPS arises from the observation that deterministic mappings (e.g. neural networks) involving random variables tend to reduce overlap coefficients among involved random variables, thereby inducing exclusivity. We further propose a lower bound in terms of the overlap coefficient, and introduce a Binary Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) that encodes images into signed binary latent representations. LDH formalizes dependence within a finite observation radius, which motivates our $\gamma$-Autoregressive Random Variable Model ($\gamma$-ARVM). $\gamma$-ARVM is an autoregressive model, with a variable observation range $\gamma$, that predicts a histogram for the next token. Using $\gamma$-ARVM, we observe that as the observation range increases, autoregressive models progressively shift toward memorization. In the limit of global dependence, the model behaves as a pure memorizer when operating on the binary latents produced by our BL-AE. Comprehensive experiments and discussions support our investigation.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent multi-modal diffusion transformers extend this by introducing joint self-attention over concatenated image and text tokens, enabling richer and more scalable cross-modal alignment. However, a detailed understanding of how and where these attention maps contribute to image generation remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Seg4Diff (Segmentation for Diffusion), a systematic framework for analyzing the attention structures of MM-DiT, with a focus on how specific layers propagate semantic information from text to image. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify a semantic grounding expert layer, a specific MM-DiT block that consistently aligns text tokens with spatially coherent image regions, naturally producing high-quality semantic segmentation masks. We further demonstrate that applying a lightweight fine-tuning scheme with mask-annotated image data enhances the semantic grouping capabilities of these layers and thereby improves both segmentation performance and generated image fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that semantic grouping is an emergent property of diffusion transformers and can be selectively amplified to advance both segmentation and generation performance, paving the way for unified models that bridge visual perception and generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

While prior methods emphasize identity preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation.

One key concept in spatial cognition is the Frame of Reference, which identifies the perspective of spatial expressions. Despite its significance, FoR has received limited attention in AI models that need spatial intelligence. There is a lack of dedicated benchmarks and in-depth evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in this area. To address this issue, we introduce the Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks (FoREST) benchmark, designed to assess FoR comprehension in LLMs. We evaluate LLMs on answering questions that require FoR comprehension and layout generation in text-to-image models using FoREST. Our results reveal a notable performance gap across different FoR classes in various LLMs, affecting their ability to generate accurate layouts for text-to-image generation. This highlights critical shortcomings in FoR comprehension. To improve FoR understanding, we propose Spatial-Guided prompting, which improves LLMs ability to extract essential spatial concepts. Our proposed method improves overall performance across spatial reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 Figures, 4 Tables, EMNLP-2025 Main (Oral)</p></details> | None |

Intriguingly, analysis of pre-trained DiT models reveals that global self-attention is often redundant, predominantly capturing local patterns-highlighting the potential for more efficient alternatives. In this paper, we revisit convolution as an alternative building block for constructing efficient and expressive diffusion models. However, naively replacing self-attention with convolution typically results in degraded performance. Our investigations attribute this performance gap to the higher channel redundancy in ConvNets compared to Transformers. To resolve this, we introduce a compact channel attention mechanism that promotes the activation of more diverse channels, thereby enhancing feature diversity. This leads to Diffusion ConvNet (DiCo), a family of diffusion models built entirely from standard ConvNet modules, offering strong generative performance with significant efficiency gains. On class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmarks, DiCo-XL achieves an FID of 2.05 at 256x256 resolution and 2.53 at 512x512, with a 2.7x and 3.1x speedup over DiT-XL/2, respectively. Furthermore, experimental results on MS-COCO demonstrate that the purely convolutional DiCo exhibits strong potential for text-to-image generation.

The U-GNN is prominent for a pooling operation that leverages zero-padding and avoids arbitrary graph coarsening, with graph convolutions layered on top to capture local dependencies. This technique permits learning feature embeddings for sampled nodes at deeper levels of the architecture that remain convolutional with respect to the original graph.

While several training-free methods attempt to solve this, they are constrained to the U-Net architecture, which not only leads to low-quality results and artifacts like object repetition but also renders them incompatible with superior Diffusion Transformer (DiT). To address these issues, we introduce AlignedGen, a novel training-free framework that enhances style consistency across images generated by DiT models. Our work first reveals a critical insight: naive attention sharing fails in DiT due to conflicting positional signals from improper position embeddings. We introduce Shifted Position Embedding (ShiftPE), an effective solution that resolves this conflict by allocating a non-overlapping set of positional indices to each image. Building on this foundation, we develop Advanced Attention Sharing (AAS), a suite of three techniques meticulously designed to fully unleash the potential of attention sharing within the DiT. Furthermore, to broaden the applicability of our method, we present an efficient query, key, and value feature extraction algorithm, enabling our method to seamlessly incorporate external images as style references. Extensive experimental results validate that our method effectively enhances style consistency across generated images while maintaining precise text-to-image alignment.</p></details> |  | None |

We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces three key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases; and (iii) a seed group strategy that controls for initialization effects to isolate exploration contributions. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce a subjective DIQA dataset DIQA-5000. The DIQA-5000 dataset comprises 5,000 document images, generated by applying multiple document enhancement techniques to 500 real-world images with diverse distortions. Each enhanced image was rated by 15 subjects across three rating dimensions: overall quality, sharpness, and color fidelity. Furthermore, we propose a specialized no-reference DIQA model that exploits document layout features to maintain quality perception at reduced resolutions to lower computational cost. Recognizing that image quality is influenced by both low-level and high-level visual features, we designed a feature fusion module to extract and integrate multi-level features from document images. To generate multi-dimensional scores, our model employs independent quality heads for each dimension to predict score distributions, allowing it to learn distinct aspects of document image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art general-purpose IQA models on both DIQA-5000 and an additional document image dataset focused on OCR accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VCE: Safe Autoregressive Image Generation via Visual Contrast Exploitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16986v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, autoregressive image generation models have wowed audiences with their remarkable capability in creating surprisingly realistic images. Models such as GPT-4o and LlamaGen can not only produce images that faithfully mimic renowned artistic styles like Ghibli, Van Gogh, or Picasso, but also potentially generate Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and ethical use. Despite these concerns, methods to safeguard autoregressive text-to-image models remain underexplored. Previous concept erasure methods, primarily designed for diffusion models that operate in denoising latent space, are not directly applicable to autoregressive models that generate images token by token. To address this critical gap, we propose Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE), a novel framework comprising: (1) an innovative contrastive image pair construction paradigm that precisely decouples unsafe concepts from their associated content semantics, and (2) a sophisticated DPO-based training approach that enhances the model's ability to identify and leverage visual contrastive features from image pairs, enabling precise concept erasure. Our comprehensive experiments across three challenging tasks-artist style erasure, explicit content erasure, and object removal-demonstrate that our method effectively secures the model, achieving state-of-the-art results while erasing unsafe concepts and maintaining the integrity of unrelated safe concepts.

However, current approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding, referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception and generative capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Attentive Eraser: Unleashing Diffusion Model's Object Removal Potential via Self-Attention Redirection Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12974v8)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have emerged as promising newcomers in the field of generative models, shining brightly in image generation. However, when employed for object removal tasks, they still encounter issues such as generating random artifacts and the incapacity to repaint foreground object areas with appropriate content after removal. To tackle these problems, we propose Attentive Eraser, a tuning-free method to empower pre-trained diffusion models for stable and effective object removal. Firstly, in light of the observation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process. Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process, effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a variety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based methods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion model architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability.

It has also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably, convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization that removes the need of early-stopping.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse style LoRA modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Such data generation entails placing relevant objects of appropriate sizes each, at meaningful location in a scene canvas. There have been two classes of popular approaches to such generation: graphics based, and generative models-based. Optimization problems are known to lurk in the background for both these classes of approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practically useful manifestation of the classical Bin Packing problem in the context of generation of synthetic image data. We conjecture that the newly introduced problem, Resizable Anchored Region Packing(RARP) Problem, is NP-hard, and provide detailed arguments about our conjecture. As a first solution, we present a novel heuristic algorithm that is generic enough and therefore scales and packs arbitrary number of arbitrary-shaped regions at arbitrary locations, into an image canvas. The algorithm follows greedy approach to iteratively pack region pairs in a careful way, while obeying the optimization constraints. The algorithm is validated by an implementation that was used to generate a large-scale synthetic anomaly detection dataset, with highly varying degree of bin packing parameters per image sample i.e. RARP instance. Visual inspection of such data and checking of the correctness of each solution proves the effectiveness of our algorithm. With generative modeling being on rise in deep learning, and synthetic data generation poised to become mainstream, we expect that the newly introduced problem will be valued in the imaging scientific community.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing open-source models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models, and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges still persist in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and contextually accurate images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page : https://vatsal-malaviya.github.io/AcT2I/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://vatsal-malaviya.github.io/AcT2I) |

In handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features. Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and is competitive with recent image generation networks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10.

However, achieving a fine-grained alignment between input prompts and generated images remains a major challenge especially in text-to-image generation. Therefore, recent works have introduced self-improving mechanisms based on self-generated data and self-feedback to efficiently mitigate this challenge without relying on external large-scale data or models. However, existing self-improving approaches have not focused on fine-grained visual details especially at the object level in generating training data or providing a feedback, and thus they still struggle to resolve the object hallucination problem in text-to-image generation. To tackle this problem, we propose an Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization (OSPO), a self-improving framework for enhancing object-level text-image alignment. OSPO is designed to explicitly address the need for constructing and leveraging object-level hard negative data and an object-centric optimization in improving object-specific fidelity. In specific, OSPO consists of: (1) Initial Prompt Generation (2) Hard Preference Pair Generation (3) Filtering and Selection (4) Object-centric Preference Optimization with Conditional Preference Loss. Extensive experiments on compositional image generation benchmarks demonstrate that OSPO significantly improves fine-grained alignment in text-to-image generation, surpassing not only prior self-improving methods but also diffusion-based specialized image generation models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual intermediation remains poorly quantified. In this work, we provide empirical analysis of the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language serves as an intermediate representation for visual information. We generated 150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual degradation and 91.5% demonstrate significant structural information loss, providing empirical evidence that the describe-then-generate bottleneck represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 Figures | None |

To address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity. These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1 produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together with substantial efficiency gains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Kuramoto Orientation Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15328v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion. Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs \textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase, gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

That is, solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN- and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images, achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we investigate whether recently developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity. Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However, its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted non-archival paper at ICCV 2025 Workshop on Curated Data for Efficient Learning (CDEL)</p></details> | None |

Existing methods typically improve fairness and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work, we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

As a generative paradigm originally designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency, and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models (ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes an AI-driven agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model (VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility, clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time inference on edge platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCVW 2025</p></details> | None |

Although many approaches focus on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term, while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

While data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review (8 pages, 2 figures)</p></details> | None |

However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing-aware vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning(PVLM) method for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZS-DFA),which facilitates effective and fine-grained traceability to unseen advanced generators. Specifically, we conduct a novel and fine-grained ZS-DFA benchmark to evaluate the attribution performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion. Besides, we propose an innovative parsing-guided vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning (PVLM) method to capture general and diverse attribution features. We are motivated by the observation that the preservation of source face attributes in facial images generated by GAN and diffusion models varies significantly. We employ the inherent face attributes preservation differences to capture face parsing-aware forgery representations. Therefore, we devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via dynamic vision-parsing matching. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center loss to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results show that our model exceeds the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA benchmark via various protocol evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Mutual Information Perspective on Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models for Positive View Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13718v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image generation, Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs) employ multiple latent variables to gradually shape the final images, from global characteristics to finer and local details (e.g., StyleGAN, NVAE), emerging as powerful tools for diverse applications. Yet their generative dynamics remain only empirically observed, without a systematic understanding of each latent variable's impact. In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies the contribution of each latent variable using Mutual Information (MI) as a metric. Our analysis reveals that current MLVGMs often underutilize some latent variables, and provides actionable insights for their use in downstream applications. With this foundation, we introduce a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL). By leveraging the hierarchical and disentangled variables of MLVGMs, our approach produces diverse and semantically meaningful views without the need for real image data. Additionally, we introduce a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy, where the generator dynamically creates new samples during SSCRL training, greatly increasing data variability. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these contributions, showing that MLVGMs' generated views compete on par with or even surpass views generated from real data. This work establishes a principled approach to understanding and exploiting MLVGMs, advancing both generative modeling and self-supervised learning.

Whilst the rapid expansion in the field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats, making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for easily setting up multiple conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, under review</p></details> | None |
| **[AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures | None |

Existing exam-style benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams, featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam, GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate knowledge, reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI.</p></details> |  | None |

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories caused by fragmented architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Recent studies have shown that abstract images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025</p></details> | None |

However, the random Gaussian noise used to start the diffusion process influences the final output, causing variations in image quality and prompt adherence. Existing noise-level optimization approaches generally rely on extra dataset construction, additional networks, or backpropagation-based optimization, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose Noise Level Guidance (NLG), a simple, efficient, and general noise-level optimization approach that refines initial noise by increasing the likelihood of its alignment with general guidance - requiring no additional training data, auxiliary networks, or backpropagation. The proposed NLG approach provides a unified framework generalizable to both conditional and unconditional diffusion models, accommodating various forms of diffusion-level guidance. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach enhances output generation quality and input condition adherence. By seamlessly integrating with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency, our method establishes NLG as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion models.

Many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent.

Existing safety methods typically refine prompts using large language models (LLMs), but they overlook the images produced, which can result in unsafe outputs or unnecessary changes to already safe prompts. To address this, we propose an iterative prompt refinement algorithm that uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze both the input prompts and the generated images. By leveraging visual feedback, our method refines prompts more effectively, improving safety while maintaining user intent and reliability comparable to existing LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset labeled with both textual and visual safety signals using off-the-shelf multi-modal LLM, enabling supervised fine-tuning.

However, the complexity of managing node connections and diverse modules can be challenging for users. In this paper, we introduce ComfyGPT, a self-optimizing multi-agent system designed to generate ComfyUI workflows based on task descriptions automatically. The key innovations of ComfyGPT include: (1) consisting of four specialized agents to build a multi-agent workflow generation system: ReformatAgent, FlowAgent, RefineAgent, and ExecuteAgent; (2) focusing on generating precise node connections instead of entire workflows, improving generation accuracy; and (3) enhancing workflow generation through reinforcement learning. Moreover, we introduce FlowDataset, a large-scale dataset containing 13,571 workflow-description pairs, and FlowBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating workflow generation systems. Additionally, we propose four novel evaluation metrics: Format Validation (FV), Pass Accuracy (PA), Pass Instruct Alignment (PIA), and Pass Node Diversity (PND).

Current fashion image editing techniques, though advanced with multimodal prompts and powerful diffusion models, often struggle to accurately identify editing regions and preserve the desired garment texture detail. To address these challenges, we introduce a new multimodal fashion image editing architecture based on latent diffusion models, called Detail-Preserved Diffusion Models (DPDEdit). DPDEdit guides the fashion image generation of diffusion models by integrating text prompts, region masks, human pose images, and garment texture images. To precisely locate the editing region, we first introduce Grounded-SAM to predict the editing region based on the user's textual description, and then combine it with other conditions to perform local editing. To transfer the detail of the given garment texture into the target fashion image, we propose a texture injection and refinement mechanism. Specifically, this mechanism employs a decoupled cross-attention layer to integrate textual descriptions and texture images, and incorporates an auxiliary U-Net to preserve the high-frequency details of generated garment texture. Additionally, we extend the VITON-HD dataset using a multimodal large language model to generate paired samples with texture images and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our DPDEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image fidelity and coherence with the given multimodal inputs.</p></details> | 13 pages,12 figures | None |

However, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many situations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are available. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> | None |

Existing works predominantly focus on output-level demographic distributions, which do not necessarily guarantee concept representations to be disentangled post-mitigation. We propose BiasMap, a model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational biases in stable diffusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g., gender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into representational bias during the image generation. Using attribution maps of these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics-semantics concept entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that remains hidden in existing fairness discovery approaches. In addition, we further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected SoftIoU during the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional bias mitigation.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their remarkable advancements, diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically, End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

We collected a dataset, called FF5, of five fake face image generators, including recent diffusion models. We find that a simple model trained on a specific image generator can achieve near-perfect accuracy in separating synthetic and real images. The model handles common image distortions (reduced resolution, compression) by using data augmentation. Moreover, partial manipulations, where synthetic images are blended into real ones by inpainting, are identified and the area of the manipulation is localized by a simple model of YOLO architecture. However, the model turned out to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks and does not generalize to unseen generators. Failure to generalize to detect images produced by a newer generator also occurs for recent state-of-the-art methods, which we tested on Realistic Vision, a fine-tuned version of StabilityAI's Stable Diffusion image generator.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was presented at the DAGM German Conference on Pattern Recognition (GCPR), 2025</p></details> | None |

However, optimizing these circuits remains challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints. While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner into practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, to appear in ASP-DAC'26</p></details> | None |
| **[Double Helix Diffusion for Cross-Domain Anomaly Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12787v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2) the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation, connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing diffusion parallelism inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy, demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on heterogeneous GPUs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Image Tokenizer Needs Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12474v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However, there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers, coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 16 figures, 10 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.08354</p></details> | None |

We present Structured Masking for AR-based Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[KB-DMGen: Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic Pose Masking for Human Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20083v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in Human Image Generation (HIG) with various control signals such as pose priors. In HIG, both accurate human poses and coherent visual quality are crucial for image generation. However, most existing methods mainly focus on pose accuracy while neglecting overall image quality, often improving pose alignment at the cost of image quality. To address this, we propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB), implemented as a visual codebook, provides coarse, global guidance based on input text-related visual features, improving pose accuracy while maintaining image quality, while the Dynamic pose Mask (DM) offers fine-grained local control to enhance precise pose accuracy. By injecting KB and DM at different stages of the diffusion process, our framework enhances pose accuracy through both global and local control without compromising image quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of KB-DMGen, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on the HumanArt dataset.

| **[Robust Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models: A Theoretical Perspective on Security and Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12024v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE} (Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an \emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models.</p></details> | Camera ready version | None |

It is difficult for dental professionals to strike a balance between esthetic requirements and functional requirements. Traditional smile design has had heavy reliance on dentist expertise and used plaster models and hand drawings, raising questions about the outcome for patients. Digital technology, led by Dr. Christian Coachman in 2007, allows photographic and videographic assessments, enabling improved intercommunication among specialists and patients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have supported analysis of facial features and development of personalized smile designs in the last few years. Outputs are, however, susceptible to practitioner bias or limitations of training data, and may be suboptimal for individual users. The study presented here suggests a comprehensive system integrating AI, big data, and recognition technologies to automate the smile design process so that both experienced and inexperienced dentists can generate pleasing aesthetics with ease. The system has a Facial Feature Extraction Module and an Image Generation Module, serving diverse practitioner and patient needs. User data can be incorporated in future research for design optimization and testing of virtual and augmented reality for real-time previewing. Data gathered can also be employed in aesthetic preference analyses, which can enhance our knowledge of smile design in dental practice.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures | None |

Recognizing this, we aim to generate images for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current best practices in this field, based on GANs, have not yet reached the desired level of quality. As latent diffusion models make significant strides in image generation, we are prompted to evaluate ControlNet, a notable method for its dense control capabilities. Our investigation uncovered two primary issues with its results: the presence of weird sub-structures within large semantic areas and the misalignment of content with the semantic mask. Through empirical study, we pinpointed the cause of these problems as a mismatch between the noised training data distribution and the standard normal prior applied at the inference stage. To address this challenge, we developed specific noise priors for SIS, encompassing spatial, categorical, and a novel spatial-categorical joint prior for inference. This approach, which we have named SCP-Diff, has set new state-of-the-art results in SIS on Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, yielding a FID as low as 10.53 on Cityscapes.

However, these models are strongly restricted to their limited knowledge, a.k.a., their own fixed parameters, that are trained with closed datasets. This leads to significant hallucinations or distortions when facing fine-grained and unseen novel real-world objects, e.g., the appearance of the Tesla Cybertruck. To this end, we present the first real-object-based retrieval-augmented generation framework (RealRAG), which augments fine-grained and unseen novel object generation by learning and retrieving real-world images to overcome the knowledge gaps of generative models. Specifically, to integrate missing memory for unseen novel object generation, we train a reflective retriever by self-reflective contrastive learning, which injects the generator's knowledge into the sef-reflective negatives, ensuring that the retrieved augmented images compensate for the model's missing knowledge. Furthermore, the real-object-based framework integrates fine-grained visual knowledge for the generative models, tackling the distortion problem and improving the realism for fine-grained object generation. Our Real-RAG is superior in its modular application to all types of state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models and also delivers remarkable performance boosts with all of them, such as a gain of 16.18% FID score with the auto-regressive model on the Stanford Car benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 | None |
| **[SeeDiff: Off-the-Shelf Seeded Mask Generation from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19808v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |

To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image quality and style diversity.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast, optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance. Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images, generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer. Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

This shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and instruction-following capabilities.

In this paper, we adopt a human-centered approach to responsible model development by involving stakeholders in evaluating and reflecting on the promises, risks, and challenges of a novel text-to-CT Scan GenAI model. Through exploratory model prompting activities, we uncover the perspectives of medical students, radiology trainees, and radiologists on the role that text-to-CT Scan GenAI can play across medical education, training, and practice. This human-centered approach additionally enabled us to surface technical challenges and domain-specific risks of generating synthetic medical images.

The method builds on probabilistic modelling of the image generative process, where the underlying common anatomy and geometric variations of the observed images are explicitly disentangled as latent variables. Therefore, groupwise image registration is achieved via hierarchical Bayesian inference. We propose a novel hierarchical variational auto-encoding architecture to realise the inference procedure of the latent variables, where the registration parameters can be explicitly estimated in a mathematically interpretable fashion. Remarkably, this new paradigm learns groupwise image registration in an unsupervised closed-loop self-reconstruction process, sparing the burden of designing complex image-based similarity measures. The computationally efficient disentangled network architecture is also inherently scalable and flexible, allowing for groupwise registration on large-scale image groups with variable sizes. Furthermore, the inferred structural representations from multi-modal images via disentanglement learning are capable of capturing the latent anatomy of the observations with visual semantics. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the proposed framework, including four different datasets from cardiac, brain, and abdominal medical images. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our method over conventional similarity-based approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |

By design, TTI models always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate default images: images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. Studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for prompt engineering and TTI generation. We present the first investigation into default images on Midjourney. We describe an initial study in which we manually created input prompts triggering default images, and several ablation studies. Building on these, we conduct a computational analysis of about 750,000 images, revealing consistent default images across unrelated prompts. We also conduct an online user study investigating how default images may affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI generation, highlighting their practical relevance as well as challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures | None |
