The world model leverages action and visual inputs to predict future image states, learning the underlying physics of the environment to refine action generation. Conversely, the VLA model produces subsequent actions from image observations, enhancing visual understanding and supporting the world model's image generation. The unified framework of RynnVLA-002 enables joint learning of environmental dynamics and action planning. Our experiments show that RynnVLA-002 surpasses individual VLA and world models, demonstrating their mutual enhancement. We evaluate RynnVLA-002 in both simulation and real-world robot tasks. RynnVLA-002 achieves 97.4% success rate on the LIBERO simulation benchmark without pretraining, while in real-world LeRobot experiments, its integrated world model boosts the overall success rate by 50%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EvDiff: High Quality Video with an Event Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17492v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Can AI Perceive Physical Danger and Intervene?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21651v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark is released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2) |
| **[The Coding Limits of Robust Watermarking for Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10577v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We ask a basic question about cryptographic watermarking for generative models: to what extent can a watermark remain reliable when an adversary is allowed to corrupt the encoded signal? To study this question, we introduce a minimal coding abstraction that we call a zero-bit tamper-detection code. This is a secret-key procedure that samples a pseudorandom codeword and, given a candidate word, decides whether it should be treated as unmarked content or as the result of tampering with a valid codeword. It captures the two core requirements of robust watermarking: soundness and tamper detection. Within this abstraction we prove a sharp unconditional limit on robustness to independent symbol corruption. For an alphabet of size $q$, there is a critical corruption rate of $1 - 1/q$ such that no scheme with soundness, even relaxed to allow a fixed constant false positive probability on random content, can reliably detect tampering once an adversary can change more than this fraction of symbols. In particular, in the binary case no cryptographic watermark can remain robust if more than half of the encoded bits are modified. We also show that this threshold is tight by giving simple information-theoretic constructions that achieve soundness and tamper detection for all strictly smaller corruption rates. We then test experimentally whether this limit appears in practice by looking at the recent watermarking for images of Gunn, Zhao, and Song (ICLR 2025). We show that a simple crop and resize operation reliably flipped about half of the latent signs and consistently prevented belief-propagation decoding from recovering the codeword, erasing the watermark while leaving the image visually intact.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL). Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving Multimodal Distillation for 3D Semantic Segmentation under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17455v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation networks trained under full supervision for one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars without intervention. To reduce the performance gap under domain shifts, a recent trend is to leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) providing robust features across domains. In this work, we conduct an exhaustive study to identify recipes for exploiting VFMs in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of lidar point clouds. Building upon unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, our study reveals that: (1) the architecture of the lidar backbone is key to maximize the generalization performance on a target domain; (2) it is possible to pretrain a single backbone once and for all, and use it to address many domain shifts; (3) best results are obtained by keeping the pretrained backbone frozen and training an MLP head for semantic segmentation. The resulting pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in four widely-recognized and challenging settings. The code will be available at: https://github.com/valeoai/muddos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/valeoai/muddos) |
| **[Illustrator's Depth: Monocular Layer Index Prediction for Image Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17454v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Illustrator's Depth, a novel definition of depth that addresses a key challenge in digital content creation: decomposing flat images into editable, ordered layers. Inspired by an artist's compositional process, illustrator's depth infers a layer index to each pixel, forming an interpretable image decomposition through a discrete, globally consistent ordering of elements optimized for editability. We also propose and train a neural network using a curated dataset of layered vector graphics to predict layering directly from raster inputs. Our layer index inference unlocks a range of powerful downstream applications. In particular, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image vectorization while also enabling high-fidelity text-to-vector-graphics generation, automatic 3D relief generation from 2D images, and intuitive depth-aware editing. By reframing depth from a physical quantity to a creative abstraction, illustrator's depth prediction offers a new foundation for editable image decomposition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Planning with Sketch-Guided Verification for Physics-Aware Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17450v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: https://sketchverify.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[SPEAR-1: Scaling Beyond Robot Demonstrations via 3D Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17411v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic Foundation Models (RFMs) hold great promise as generalist, end-to-end systems for robot control. Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $π_0$-FAST and $π_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\times$ fewer robot demonstrations. This carefully-engineered training strategy unlocks new VLM capabilities and as a consequence boosts the reliability of embodied control beyond what is achievable with only robotic data. We make our model weights and 3D-annotated datasets publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

The majority of the existing face image datasets often suffer from notable biases related to race, gender, and other demographic characteristics, limiting the effectiveness and fairness of face verification systems. In response to these challenges, we propose a comprehensive methodology that integrates advanced generative models to create varied and diverse high-quality synthetic face images. This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs. Furthermore, we introduce the Diverse and Inclusive Faces for Verification (DIF-V) dataset, comprising 27,780 images of 926 unique identities, designed as a benchmark for future research in face verification. Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance. By tackling the inherent inequities in existing datasets, this work not only enriches the discussion on diversity and ethics in artificial intelligence but also lays the foundation for developing more inclusive and reliable face verification technologies</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Crafting Imperceptible On-Manifold Adversarial Attacks for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10998v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks on tabular data present unique challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional gradient-based methods prioritise $\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions. To address this, we propose a latent-space perturbation framework using a mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate statistically consistent adversarial examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve statistical consistency. We introduce In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to jointly evaluate attack effectiveness and distributional alignment. Evaluation across six publicly available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted from image domain approaches, achieving substantially lower outlier rates and higher IDSR across six datasets and three model architectures. Our comprehensive analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control, and generative architecture demonstrate that the effectiveness of VAE-based attacks depends strongly on reconstruction quality and the availability of sufficient training data. When these conditions are met, the proposed framework achieves superior practical utility and stability compared with input-space methods. This work underscores the importance of maintaining on-manifold perturbations for generating realistic and robust adversarial examples in tabular domains.</p></details> | Final Version | None |
| **[A Training-Free Style-Personalization via SVD-Based Feature Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04482v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation that operates during inference using a scale-wise autoregressive model. Our method generates a stylized image guided by a single reference style while preserving semantic consistency and mitigating content leakage. Through a detailed step-wise analysis of the generation process, we identify a pivotal step where the dominant singular values of the internal feature encode style-related components. Building upon this insight, we introduce two lightweight control modules: Principal Feature Blending, which enables precise modulation of style through SVD-based feature reconstruction, and Structural Attention Correction, which stabilizes structural consistency by leveraging content-guided attention correction across fine stages. Without any additional training, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures | None |

Our approach generates visual representations of premises using text-to-image models and performs inference by comparing these representations with textual hypotheses. We evaluate two inference techniques: cosine similarity and visual question answering. Our method achieves high accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics. Additionally, we design a controlled adversarial dataset to validate the robustness of our approach. Our findings suggest that leveraging visual modality as a meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Latent Transmission and Glare Maps for Lens Veiling Glare Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17353v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beyond the commonly recognized optical aberrations, the imaging performance of compact optical systems-including single-lens and metalens designs-is often further degraded by veiling glare caused by stray-light scattering from non-ideal optical surfaces and coatings, particularly in complex real-world environments. This compound degradation undermines traditional lens aberration correction yet remains underexplored. A major challenge is that conventional scattering models (e.g., for dehazing) fail to fit veiling glare due to its spatial-varying and depth-independent nature. Consequently, paired high-quality data are difficult to prepare via simulation, hindering application of data-driven veiling glare removal models. To this end, we propose VeilGen, a generative model that learns to simulate veiling glare by estimating its underlying optical transmission and glare maps in an unsupervised manner from target images, regularized by Stable Diffusion (SD)-based priors. VeilGen enables paired dataset generation with realistic compound degradation of optical aberrations and veiling glare, while also providing the estimated latent optical transmission and glare maps to guide the veiling glare removal process. We further introduce DeVeiler, a restoration network trained with a reversibility constraint, which utilizes the predicted latent maps to guide an inverse process of the learned scattering model. Extensive experiments on challenging compact optical systems demonstrate that our approach delivers superior restoration quality and physical fidelity compared with existing methods. These suggest that VeilGen reliably synthesizes realistic veiling glare, and its learned latent maps effectively guide the restoration process in DeVeiler.

While recent generative models have advanced artistic image synthesis, they struggle to generalize across media and often show temporal or structural inconsistencies, hindering faithful reproduction of human creative workflows. To address this, we propose a unified framework for multi-media painting process generation with a semantics-driven style control mechanism that embeds multiple media into a diffusion models conditional space and uses cross-medium style augmentation. This enables consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles. A reverse-painting training strategy further ensures smooth, human-aligned generation. We also build a large-scale dataset of real painting processes and evaluate cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity, achieving strong results on LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP metrics. Finally, our Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve quantitatively models the creative sequence, i.e., composition, color blocking, and detail refinement, mirroring human artistic progression.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Refracting Reality: Generating Images with Realistic Transparent Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17340v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative image models can produce convincingly real images, with plausible shapes, textures, layouts and lighting. However, one domain in which they perform notably poorly is in the synthesis of transparent objects, which exhibit refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering. Refraction is a particular challenge, because refracted pixel rays often intersect with surfaces observed in other parts of the image, providing a constraint on the color. It is clear from inspection that generative models have not distilled the laws of optics sufficiently well to accurately render refractive objects. In this work, we consider the problem of generating images with accurate refraction, given a text prompt. We synchronize the pixels within the object's boundary with those outside by warping and merging the pixels using Snell's Law of Refraction, at each step of the generation trajectory. For those surfaces that are not directly observed in the image, but are visible via refraction or reflection, we recover their appearance by synchronizing the image with a second generated image -- a panorama centered at the object -- using the same warping and merging procedure. We demonstrate that our approach generates much more optically-plausible images that respect the physical constraints.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lung-DDPM+: Efficient Thoracic CT Image Synthesis using Diffusion Probabilistic Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09327v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks, such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves 8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM. Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks. We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules, highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging.

However, many neural-based models rely on large datasets, raising concerns about copyright infringement and high-performance costs. In contrast, we propose MusicAIR, an innovative multimodal AI music generation framework powered by a novel algorithm-driven symbolic music core, effectively mitigating copyright infringement risks. The music core algorithms connect critical lyrical and rhythmic information to automatically derive musical features, creating a complete, coherent melodic score solely from the lyrics. The MusicAIR framework facilitates music generation from lyrics, text, and images. The generated score adheres to established principles of music theory, lyrical structure, and rhythmic conventions. We developed Generate AI Music (GenAIM), a web tool using MusicAIR for lyric-to-song, text-to-music, and image-to-music generation. In our experiments, we evaluated AI-generated music scores produced by the system using both standard music metrics and innovative analysis that compares these compositions with original works. The system achieves an average key confidence of 85%, outperforming human composers at 79%, and aligns closely with established music theory standards, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse, human-like compositions. As a co-pilot tool, GenAIM can serve as a reliable music composition assistant and a possible educational composition tutor while simultaneously lowering the entry barrier for all aspiring musicians, which is innovative and significantly contributes to AI for music generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Big Data 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[HazeMatching: Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22397v5)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 11 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 8 pages + refs, 45 pages total (including supplement), 28 supplementary figures</p></details> | None |

At its very core, CSR is about finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques, stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here, we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4 diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results, demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases, enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[SpatialGeo:Boosting Spatial Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs via Geometry-Semantics Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17308v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in image and language tasks due to the strong reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[One Small Step in Latent, One Giant Leap for Pixels: Fast Latent Upscale Adapter for Your Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10629v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models struggle to scale beyond their training resolutions, as direct high-resolution sampling is slow and costly, while post-hoc image super-resolution (ISR) introduces artifacts and additional latency by operating after decoding. We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Platonic Representations for Poverty Mapping: Unified Vision-Language Codes or Agent-Induced Novelty?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01109v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images, (ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.</p></details> | 7 figures | None |

Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Resolving Sentiment Discrepancy for Multimodal Sentiment Detection via Semantics Completion and Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07026v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of social media posts in recent years, the need to detect sentiments in multimodal (image-text) content has grown rapidly. Since posts are user-generated, the image and text from the same post can express different or even contradictory sentiments, leading to potential \textbf{sentiment discrepancy}. However, existing works mainly adopt a single-branch fusion structure that primarily captures the consistent sentiment between image and text. The ignorance or implicit modeling of discrepant sentiment results in compromised unimodal encoding and limited performance. In this paper, we propose a semantics Completion and Decomposition (CoDe) network to resolve the above issue. In the semantics completion module, we complement image and text representations with the semantics of the in-image text, helping bridge the sentiment gap. In the semantics decomposition module, we decompose image and text representations with exclusive projection and contrastive learning, thereby explicitly capturing the discrepant sentiment between modalities. Finally, we fuse image and text representations by cross-attention and combine them with the learned discrepant sentiment for final classification. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of CoDe and the effectiveness of each proposed module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Pattern Recognition</p></details> | None |

In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, Project Page: https://github.com/SooLab/AllPath</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SooLab/AllPath) |
| **[Dual-domain Adaptation Networks for Realistic Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17217v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic image super-resolution (SR) focuses on transforming real-world low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones, handling more complex degradation patterns than synthetic SR tasks. This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.

Our Self-Supervised & Cross-Modal Pretraining for CT Representation Extraction (SPECTRE) approach utilizes scalable 3D Vision Transformer architectures and modern self-supervised and vision-language pretraining strategies to learn general-purpose CT representations. Volumetric CT poses unique challenges, such as extreme token scaling, geometric anisotropy, and weak or noisy clinical supervision, that make standard transformer and contrastive learning recipes ineffective out of the box. The framework jointly optimizes a local transformer for high-resolution volumetric feature extraction and a global transformer for whole-scan context modeling, making large-scale 3D attention computationally tractable. Notably, SPECTRE is trained exclusively on openly available CT datasets, demonstrating that high-performing, generalizable representations can be achieved without relying on private data. Pretraining combines DINO-style self-distillation with SigLIP-based vision-language alignment using paired radiology reports, yielding features that are both geometrically consistent and clinically meaningful. Across multiple CT benchmarks, SPECTRE consistently outperforms prior CT foundation models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, establishing SPECTRE as a scalable, open, and fully transformer-based foundation model for 3D medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Real Noise Decoupling for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17196v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial step in enhancing the quality of HSIs. Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments on public and our captured datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, SISR has made a significant leap and achieved promising results with deep learning. GAN-based models stand out among all the deep learning models because of their excellent performance in perceiving quality. However, it is rather difficult for them to reconstruct realistic high-frequency details and achieve stable training. To solve these issues, we introduce an Edge-Attention guided Generative Adversarial Network (EatGAN), the first GAN-based SISR model that simultaneously leverages edge priors both explicitly and implicitly inside the generator, which (i) proposes a Normalized Edge Attention (NEA) mechanism based on channel-affine and spatial gating that transforms edge prior into lightweight, learnable modulation parameters and injects and fuses them multiple times in a (ii) edge-guided hybrid residual block, which progressively enforces structural consistency across scales; and (iii) a composite generator objective combining pixel, perceptual, edge-gradient, and adversarial terms. Experiments show consistent state-of-the-art across distortion-oriented benchmarks and perception oriented benchmarks. Notably, our model achieves 40.87 dB and 0.073 (LPIPS) on Manga 109, which indicates that reframing image priors from passive guidance into a controllable modulation primitive for generators can chart a practical path toward trustworthy, high-fidelity Super-Resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages (8 pages of main text + 3 pages of reference + 6 pages of supplementary material)</p></details> | None |

These fundamental problems in computer vision are powered by large-scale, painstakingly annotated datasets. Despite their impact, these datasets are costly to build, biased in coverage, and difficult to scale. Synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative but struggle with flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity. We introduce Synthetic Object Compositions (SOC), an accurate and scalable data synthesis pipeline via a novel object-centric composition strategy. It composes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation and camera configuration augmentation with generative harmonization and mask-area-weighted blending, yielding accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on just 100K of our synthetic images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) and synthetic pipelines (Copy-Paste, X-Paste, SynGround, SegGen) by +24-36% -- achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO. Beyond the general open-vocabulary setup, SOC also enables controllable dataset construction for different use cases and boosts performance in both low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments delivers strong performance across different real-data scales and yields even greater improvements under extremely limited real-data conditions, including +6.59 AP on a 1% COCO data setup. Furthermore, this controllability enables targeted data generation for intra-class referring, a diagnostic grounding task we propose that requires fine-grained attribute discrimination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/weikaih04/Synthetic-Detection-Segmentation-Grounding-Data</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/weikaih04/Synthetic-Detection-Segmentation-Grounding-Data) |
| **[Model Inversion Attack Against Deep Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12233v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep hashing improves retrieval efficiency through compact binary codes, yet it introduces severe and often overlooked privacy risks. The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional LIC suffers from severe artifacts due to heavy quantization, while generative VQ modeling gives poor fidelity due to the mismatch between learned generative priors and specific inputs. In this work, we propose Hybrid-Diffusion Image Compression (HDCompression), a dual-stream framework that utilizes both generative VQ-modeling and diffusion models, as well as conventional LIC, to achieve both high fidelity and high perceptual quality. Different from previous hybrid methods that directly use pre-trained LIC models to generate low-quality fidelity-preserving information from heavily quantized latent, we use diffusion models to extract high-quality complementary fidelity information from the ground-truth input, which can enhance the system performance in several aspects: improving index map prediction, enhancing the fidelity-preserving output of the LIC stream, and refining conditioned image reconstruction with VQ-latent correction. In addition, our diffusion model is based on a dense representative vector (DRV), which is lightweight with very simple sampling schedulers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HDCompression outperforms the previous conventional LIC, generative VQ-modeling, and hybrid frameworks in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualization, providing balanced robust compression performance at ultra-low bitrates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PRICAI 2025 (Oral Presentation)</p></details> | None |

Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, albeit at the cost of slightly more false positives. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\%$ to $6.3\%$. The subsequent hardware-aware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over $20\%$ with negligible impact on RD performance, yielding a final model that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality to existing FPGA-based LIC implementations.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we present REArtGS, a novel framework that introduces additional geometric and motion constraints to 3D Gaussian primitives, enabling realistic surface reconstruction and generation for articulated objects. Specifically, given multi-view RGB images of arbitrary two states of articulated objects, we first introduce an unbiased Signed Distance Field (SDF) guidance to regularize Gaussian opacity fields, enhancing geometry constraints and improving surface reconstruction quality. Then we establish deformable fields for 3D Gaussians constrained by the kinematic structures of articulated objects, achieving unsupervised generation of surface meshes in unseen states. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate our approach achieves high-quality textured surface reconstruction for given states, and enables high-fidelity surface generation for unseen states.

Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image. However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose \textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To train AutoV, we develop an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various visual prompts for LVLMs. Experiments indicate that AutoV enhances the performance of various LVLMs across multiple image understanding tasks. For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{10.2}\%$ accuracy gain on VizWiz, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{3.8}\%$ on MMMU, highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method.</p></details> | 17 pages | None |

Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; Under review</p></details> | None |

However, despite their efficiency, VAR models often suffer from the diversity collapse i.e., a reduction in output variability, analogous to that observed in few-step distilled diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances generative diversity with only neglectable performance influences.

Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables; Accepted by WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs. Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying and intervening in gender bias within T2I models.

However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |

In this article, an OSDG framework for hyperspectral image classification is proposed, centered on a new Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty Disentanglement mechanism. It has been designed to address the domain shift influencing both spectral, spatial and combined feature extraction pathways using evidential deep learning, after which the most reliable pathway for each sample is adaptively selected. The proposed framework is further integrated with frequency-domain feature extraction for domain-invariant representation learning, dual-channel residual networks for spectral-spatial feature extraction, and evidential deep learning based uncertainty quantification. Experiments conducted on three cross scene hyperspectral datasets, show that performance comparable to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods can be achieved despite no access to target data, while high unknown-class rejection and known-class accuracy levels are maintained. The implementation will be available at github.com/amir-khb/UGOSDG upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](http://github.com/amir-khb/UGOSDG) |

Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation. These approaches help reduce the total generation time to under 30 minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes, surpassing prior approaches in both rendering speed and visual quality while preserving editability. The code will be available soon.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EurIPS 2025 workshop "Rethinking AI: Efficiency, Frugality, and Sustainability"</p></details> | None |

Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MMAsia 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Vision Language Models are Confused Tourists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17004v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VLM-Augmented Degradation Modeling for Image Restoration Under Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16998v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions, such as rain, haze, snow, or a mixture of them, is desirable yet challenging for autonomous driving and outdoor robots. In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DReX: Pure Vision Fusion of Self-Supervised and Convolutional Representations for Image Complexity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16991v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual complexity prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in image compression, retrieval, and classification. Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,3 figures,aaai2026</p></details> | None |

Existing image-to-image generation methods often produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment. We introduce the first oven-based cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and propose an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image. This formulation enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets. To ensure temporal consistency and culinary plausibility, we introduce a domain-specific \textit{Culinary Image Similarity (CIS)} metric, which serves both as a training loss and a progress-monitoring signal. Our model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30\% improvement on our dataset; 60\% on public datasets)</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures | None |

While generative models have advanced material synthesis, existing methods lack a unified representation bridging natural image appearance and PBR properties, leading to fragmented task-specific pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB image data. We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture. Trained on MatHybrid-410K, a mixed corpus combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images, MatPedia achieves native $1024\times1024$ synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity.</p></details> |  | None |

The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based multi-temporal-resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-temporal-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding the optical flow being dominated by head movements. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, we use the proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) operation and convolutional layers to extract multi-scale spatio-temporal features. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  | None |

However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design instructions for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Noted...</summary><p>Noted that This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material</p></details> | None |

We tackle the setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available. We propose Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that localizes and edits defects by contrasting two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. By accumulating per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, we obtain a mask to guide the latent inpainting during later diffusion steps and preserve the surrounding context while generating realistic local defects. To improve stability and control, DeltaDeno performs token-level prompt refinement that aligns shared content and strengthens anomaly tokens, and applies a spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens in the predicted region. Experiments on public datasets show that DeltaDeno achieves great generation, realism and consistent gains in downstream detection performance.

However, traditional methods for object ReID directly adopting CNN models trained on the ImageNet dataset usually produce unsatisfactory retrieval performance on colonoscopic datasets due to the large domain gap. Additionally, these methods neglect to explore the potential of self-discrepancy among intra-class or inter-class relations in the colonoscopic polyp dataset, which remains an open research problem in the medical community. To solve this dilemma, we propose a simple but effective training method named Colo-ReID, which can help our model learn more general and discriminative knowledge based on the meta-learning strategy in scenarios with fewer samples. Based on this, a dynamic Meta-Learning Regulation mechanism called MLR is introduced to further boost the performance of polyp re-identification. Our experimental results show that Colo-ReID consistently outperforms second-best method in terms of mAP performance by +2.3% on polyp re-identification task.

Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops. Our initial exploration suggests that unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark.

While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold. Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach for image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.</p></details> |  | None |

Current benchmarks test high level relationships ('left of,' 'behind', etc.) but ignore fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real world applications: precise 3D localization, physical compatibility between objects, object affordances and multi step spatial planning. In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark. We also release BOP-ASK-lab, an out-of-distribution benchmark with images not sourced from BOP, enabling testing of generalization.

However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address. Additionally, we provide a collection of essential open-access resources, tools, and tutorials, available on our GitHub: https://github.com/mkhateri/Awesome-MRI-Super-Resolution.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.</p></details> |  | None |

This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models including a Vision Transformer under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high accuracy (96-98%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V2 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations in this study confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/kiranshahi/pneumonia-analysis</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/kiranshahi/pneumonia-analysis) |

While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details. This work bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, providing a scalable route to single input, object level multi-view SVG generation and supporting applications such as asset creation and semantic vector editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns. We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.</p></details> | Accepted to WACV2025 | None |

While state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods excel at synthesizing photorealistic novel views through rasterization-based rendering, their reliance on sparse, explicit primitives severely limits their ability to recover watertight and topologically consistent 3D surfaces.We introduce MonoGSDF, a novel method that couples Gaussian-based primitives with a neural Signed Distance Field (SDF) for high-quality reconstruction. During training, the SDF guides Gaussians' spatial distribution, while at inference, Gaussians serve as priors to reconstruct surfaces, eliminating the need for memory-intensive Marching Cubes. To handle arbitrary-scale scenes, we propose a scaling strategy for robust generalization. A multi-resolution training scheme further refines details and monocular geometric cues from off-the-shelf estimators enhance reconstruction quality. Experiments on real-world datasets show MonoGSDF outperforms prior methods while maintaining efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Machine Learning-Driven Solution for Denoising Inertial Confinement Fusion Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16717v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we show that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and (2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our dataset and method produce highly customized portraits with superior visual quality that are tailored to human preferences.

| **[Towards Metric-Aware Multi-Person Mesh Recovery by Jointly Optimizing Human Crowd in Camera Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13282v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-person human mesh recovery from a single image is a challenging task, hindered by the scarcity of in-the-wild training data. Prevailing in-the-wild human mesh pseudo-ground-truth (pGT) generation pipelines are single-person-centric, where each human is processed individually without joint optimization. This oversight leads to a lack of scene-level consistency, producing individuals with conflicting depths and scales within the same image. To address this, we introduce Depth-conditioned Translation Optimization (DTO), a novel optimization-based method that jointly refines the camera-space translations of all individuals in a crowd. By leveraging anthropometric priors on human height and depth cues from a monocular depth estimator, DTO solves for a scene-consistent placement of all subjects within a principled Maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. Applying DTO to the 4D-Humans dataset, we construct DTO-Humans, a new large-scale pGT dataset of 0.56M high-quality, scene-consistent multi-person images, featuring dense crowds with an average of 4.8 persons per image. Furthermore, we propose Metric-Aware HMR, an end-to-end network that directly estimates human mesh and camera parameters in metric scale. This is enabled by a camera branch and a relative metric loss that enforces plausible relative scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on relative depth reasoning and human mesh recovery.

In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. Additionally, we show that our model is effective for style-based image editing, where specific style parameters correspond to distinct facial movements. These findings underscore the model's potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for research on macaque facial expressions.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

The benchmark is built from both synthetic and real-world image sequences and provides a diverse set of answer-verifiable tasks that are reproducible, scalable, and unambiguous. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://oahzxl.github.io/VReasonBench</p></details> | [Code Link](https://oahzxl.github.io/VReasonBench) |

However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |

Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

As data sets grow larger, exact nearest neighbor searches quickly become unfeasible, leading to the adoption of approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searches. ANN has been studied for text data, images, and trajectories. However, there has been little effort to develop ANN systems for polygons in spatial database systems and geographic information systems. We present PolyMinHash, a system for approximate polygon similarity search that adapts MinHashing into a novel 2D polygon-hashing scheme to generate short, similarity-preserving signatures of input polygons. Minhash is generated by counting the number of randomly sampled points needed before the sampled point lands within the polygon's interior area, yielding hash values that preserve area-based Jaccard similarity. We present the tradeoff between search accuracy and runtime of our PolyMinHash system. Our hashing mechanism reduces the number of candidates to be processed in the query refinement phase by up to 98% compared to the number of candidates processed by the brute-force algorithm.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Erase to Retain: Low Rank Adaptation Guided Selective Unlearning in Medical Segmentation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16574v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement. For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent. These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.</p></details> |  | None |

However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work aims to continuously expand to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral Presentation at AAAI 2026 Main Technical Track (this version is not peer-reviewed; it is the extended version)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui) |

This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical. This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators. With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

It introduces a new automated benchmark construction method for this evaluation. The experiment compared common LVLMs with human participants using a mixed dataset of AI and human-created images. Results showed that LVLMs could distinguish between the image types to some extent but exhibited a rightward bias, and perform significantly worse compared to humans. To build on these findings, we developed an automated benchmark construction process using AI. This process involved topic retrieval, narrative script generation, error embedding, and image generation, creating a diverse set of text-image pairs with intentional errors. We validated our method through constructing two caparable benchmarks. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LVLMs in real-world understanding and advances benchmark construction techniques, providing a scalable and automatic approach for AI model evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contrastive vision-language learning with paraphrasing and negation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16527v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.</p></details> |  | None |

The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Visual Cues: Leveraging General Semantics as Support for Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16435v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

This is particularly important when high-level semantic information (e.g., actions and relations) is used to make decisions about abstract categories (e.g., danger). In such tasks, AI models need to generalise beyond situation-specific details, and this ability can be reflected in C-XAI outputs that randomise over irrelevant features. However, it is unclear whether people appreciate such generalisation and can distinguish it from other, less desirable forms of imprecision in C-XAI outputs. Therefore, the present study investigated how the generality and relevance of C-XAI outputs affect people's evaluation of AI. In an experimental railway safety evaluation scenario, participants rated the performance of a simulated AI that classified traffic scenes involving people as dangerous or not. These classification decisions were explained via concepts in the form of similar image snippets. The latter differed in their match with the classified image, either regarding a highly relevant feature (i.e., people's relation to tracks) or a less relevant feature (i.e., people's action). Contrary to the hypotheses, concepts that generalised over less relevant features were rated lower than concepts that matched the classified image precisely. Moreover, their ratings were no better than those for systematic misrepresentations of the less relevant feature. Conversely, participants were highly sensitive to imprecisions in relevant features. These findings cast doubts on the assumption that people can easily infer from C-XAI outputs whether AI models have gained a deeper understanding of complex situations.</p></details> |  | None |

Although PDF documents are prominent sources of knowledge, text-based RAG pipelines are ineffective at capturing their rich multi-modal information. In contrast, visual document RAG (VD-RAG) uses screenshots of document pages as the KB, which has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results. However, by introducing the image modality, VD-RAG introduces new attack vectors for adversaries to disrupt the system by injecting malicious documents into the KB. In this paper, we demonstrate the vulnerability of VD-RAG to poisoning attacks targeting both retrieval and generation. We define two attack objectives and demonstrate that both can be realized by injecting only a single adversarial image into the KB. Firstly, we introduce a targeted attack against one or a group of queries with the goal of spreading targeted disinformation. Secondly, we present a universal attack that, for any potential user query, influences the response to cause a denial-of-service in the VD-RAG system. We investigate the two attack objectives under both white-box and black-box assumptions, employing a multi-objective gradient-based optimization approach as well as prompting state-of-the-art generative models. Using two visual document datasets, a diverse set of state-of-the-art retrievers (embedding models) and generators (vision language models), we show VD-RAG is vulnerable to poisoning attacks in both the targeted and universal settings, yet demonstrating robustness to black-box attacks in the universal setting.</p></details> |  | None |

Through systematic pilot studies, we uncover the significant potential of ULMs to enable the synergistic co-evolution of dual capabilities within a shared policy optimization framework. Building on this insight, we introduce CoRL, a co-reinforcement learning framework comprising a unified RL stage for joint optimization and a refined RL stage for task-specific enhancement. With the proposed CoRL, our resulting model, ULM-R1, achieves average improvements of 7% on three text-to-image generation datasets and 23% on nine multimodal understanding benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRL and highlight the substantial benefit of reinforcement learning in facilitating cross-task synergy and optimization for ULMs. Code is available at https://github.com/mm-vl/ULM-R1.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/mm-vl/ULM-R1) |

Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often struggle due to insufficient background priors and limited generative capability, both of which are highly important under such conditions. In this paper, we introduce BeyondHaze, a generative nighttime dehazing method that not only reduces haze and glow effects but also reconstructs plausible background structures in regions where visual cues are heavily degraded. Our approach is built on two main ideas: obtaining strong background priors by adapting image diffusion models to nighttime dehazing, and enhancing generative ability in haze- and glow-obscured areas through guided training. Task-specific nighttime dehazing knowledge is distilled into an image diffusion model while preserving its capacity to generate clean images. The diffusion model is further trained on tailored image pairs to improve its ability to recover background details that are suppressed by haze effects. Since generative models may introduce hallucinated content, we design our framework to allow user control over the generative level, enabling a balance between visual realism and fidelity. Experiments on real-world nighttime images demonstrate that BeyondHaze substantially improves visibility and scene detail under dense haze.</p></details> |  | None |

However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.</p></details> | 2 Figures, 1 Table | None |

However, their potential in 3D scene segmentation remains largely untapped, despite the common availability of 2D images alongside 3D point cloud datasets. While significant research has been dedicated to 2D-3D fusion, recent state-of-the-art 3D methods predominantly focus on 3D data, leaving the integration of VFMs into 3D models underexplored. In this work, we challenge this trend by introducing DITR, a generally applicable approach that extracts 2D foundation model features, projects them to 3D, and finally injects them into a 3D point cloud segmentation model. DITR achieves state-of-the-art results on both indoor and outdoor 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks. To enable the use of VFMs even when images are unavailable during inference, we additionally propose to pretrain 3D models by distilling 2D foundation models. By initializing the 3D backbone with knowledge distilled from 2D VFMs, we create a strong basis for downstream 3D segmentation tasks, ultimately boosting performance across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 3DV 2026.

In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures | None |

Existing CoVR benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving, and provides 180K triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving datasets. Previous CoVR benchmarks, focusing on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct each  pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics, we propose TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image, video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR, TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 27.22.</p></details> |  | None |

We exploit the VGGT tracking head to aggregate 2D semantic instance masks into 3D objects. To allow for temporal consistency and richer contextual reasoning the system stores timestamps and instance-level identities, thereby enabling the detection of changes in the environment.

Unlearning toxic motions is challenging as those can be generated from explicit text prompts and from implicit toxic combinations of safe motions (e.g., "kicking" is "loading and swinging a leg"). We propose the first motion unlearning benchmark by filtering toxic motions from the large and recent text-to-motion datasets of HumanML3D and Motion-X. We propose baselines, by adapting state-of-the-art image unlearning techniques to process spatio-temporal signals. Finally, we propose a novel motion unlearning model based on Latent Code Replacement, which we dub LCR. LCR is training-free and suitable to the discrete latent spaces of state-of-the-art text-to-motion diffusion models. LCR is simple and consistently outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. Project page: https://www.pinlab.org/hmu.</p></details> |  | None |

In practical workflows, designers typically generate and edit each RGBA layer independently before compositing them into a final raster image. However, this process is irreversible: once composited, layer-level editing is no longer possible. Existing methods commonly rely on image matting and inpainting, but remain limited in controllability and segmentation precision. To address these challenges, we propose two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT), which decouples image elements into distinct layers and enables fine-grained control; and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA), which injects target image information into multi-layer tokens to achieve precise conditional generation. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, we build a new benchmark and introduce tailored evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in both decomposition quality and controllability. Furthermore, the separated layers produced by CLD can be directly manipulated in commonly used design tools such as PowerPoint, highlighting its practical value and applicability in real-world creative workflows.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Generalized Gradient Norm Clipping & Non-Euclidean $(L_0,L_1)$-Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01913v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a hybrid non-Euclidean optimization method which generalizes gradient norm clipping by combining steepest descent and conditional gradient approaches. The method achieves the best of both worlds by establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of ($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms for deep learning, which we dub Clipped Scion, and demonstrate their properties on image classification and language modeling.

| **[LSAP: Rethinking Inversion Fidelity, Perception and Editability in GAN Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12746v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As research on image inversion advances, the process is generally divided into two stages. The first step is Image Embedding, involves using an encoder or optimization procedure to embed an image and obtain its corresponding latent code. The second stage, referred to as Result Refinement, further improves the inversion and editing outcomes. Although this refinement stage substantially enhances reconstruction fidelity, perception and editability remain largely unchanged and are highly dependent on the latent codes derived from the first stage. Therefore, a key challenge lies in obtaining latent codes that preserve reconstruction fidelity while simultaneously improving perception and editability. In this work, we first reveal that these two properties are closely related to the degree of alignment (or disalignment) between the inverted latent codes and the synthetic distribution. Based on this insight, we propose the \textbf{ Latent Space Alignment Inversion Paradigm (LSAP)}, which integrates both an evaluation metric and a unified inversion solution. Specifically, we introduce the \textbf{Normalized Style Space ($\mathcal{S^N}$ space)} and \textbf{Normalized Style Space Cosine Distance (NSCD)} to quantify the disalignment of inversion methods. Moreover, our paradigm can be optimized for both encoder-based and optimization-based embeddings, providing a consistent alignment framework. Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that NSCD effectively captures perceptual and editable characteristics, and that our alignment paradigm achieves state-of-the-art performance in both stages of inversion.</p></details> | under review | None |
| **[Mantis: A Versatile Vision-Language-Action Model with Disentangled Visual Foresight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16175v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Video2Layout: Recall and Reconstruct Metric-Grounded Cognitive Map for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16160v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP) |
| **[How Noise Benefits AI-generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16136v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent methods are primarily built on UNet-based diffusion models, which have improved scene text editing results, but still struggle with complex glyph structures, especially for non-Latin ones (\eg, Chinese, Korean, Japanese). To address these issues, we present \textbf{FLUX-Text}, a simple and advanced multilingual scene text editing DiT method. Specifically, our FLUX-Text enhances glyph understanding and generation through lightweight Visual and Text Embedding Modules, while preserving the original generative capability of FLUX. We further propose a Regional Text Perceptual Loss tailored for text regions, along with a matching two-stage training strategy to better balance text editing and overall image quality. Benefiting from the DiT-based architecture and lightweight feature injection modules, FLUX-Text can be trained with only $0.1$M training examples, a \textbf{97\%} reduction compared to $2.9$M required by popular methods. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets, including English and Chinese benchmarks, demonstrate that our method surpasses other methods in visual quality and text fidelity.

| **[Medverse: A Universal Model for Full-Resolution 3D Medical Image Segmentation, Transformation and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09232v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent, full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities. Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and model weights will be made publicly available.

However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures | None |

However, the real-world robustness of these defenses against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. We introduce Multi-Faceted Attack (MFA), a framework that systematically exposes general safety vulnerabilities in leading defense-equipped VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Llama-4. The core component of MFA is the Attention-Transfer Attack (ATA), which hides harmful instructions inside a meta task with competing objectives. We provide a theoretical perspective based on reward hacking to explain why this attack succeeds. To improve cross-model transferability, we further introduce a lightweight transfer-enhancement algorithm combined with a simple repetition strategy that jointly bypasses both input-level and output-level filters without model-specific fine-tuning. Empirically, we show that adversarial images optimized for one vision encoder transfer broadly to unseen VLMs, indicating that shared visual representations create a cross-model safety vulnerability. Overall, MFA achieves a 58.5% success rate and consistently outperforms existing methods. On state-of-the-art commercial models, MFA reaches a 52.8% success rate, surpassing the second-best attack by 34%. These results challenge the perceived robustness of current defense mechanisms and highlight persistent safety weaknesses in modern VLMs. Code: https://github.com/cure-lab/MultiFacetedAttack</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral | [Code Link](https://github.com/cure-lab/MultiFacetedAttack) |

Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing medical image datasets either simply overlooked the nuance and polarise into binary label. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to directly mine medical reports to utilise the uncertainty relevant expression for supervision signal. At first, we collect uncertainty keywords from medical reports. Then, we use Qwen-3 4B to identify the textual uncertainty and map them into an adaptive Generalized Label Smoothing (GLS) rate. This rate allows our model to treat uncertain labels not as errors, but as informative signals, effectively incorporating expert skepticism into the training process. We establish a new clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark to rigorously evaluate this problem. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in medical disease detection.

This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality in real-world scenarios - for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce OMFA (One Model For All), a unified diffusion framework for both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition garments and supports arbitrary poses. OMFA is inspired by language modeling, where generation is guided by conditioning prompts. However, our framework differs fundamentally from LLMs in two key aspects. First, it employs a bidirectional modeling paradigm that symmetrically allows prompting either from the garment to generate try-on results or from the dressed person to recover the try-off garment. Second, it strictly adheres to Tweedie's formula, enabling faithful estimation of the underlying data distribution during the denoising process. Instead of imposing lower body constraints, OMFA is an entirely mask-free framework that requires only a single portrait and a target garment as input, and is designed to support flexible outfit combinations and cross-person garment transfer, making it better aligned with practical usage scenarios. Additionally, by leveraging SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a practical solution for virtual garment synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |

In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views.

| **[Towards a Safer and Sustainable Manufacturing Process: Material classification in Laser Cutting Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16026v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Video Translation via Token Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12099v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the revolution of generative AI, video-related tasks have been widely studied. However, current state-of-the-art video models still lag behind image models in visual quality and user control over generated content. In this paper, we introduce TokenWarping, a novel framework for temporally coherent video translation. Existing diffusion-based video editing approaches rely solely on key and value patches in self-attention to ensure temporal consistency, often sacrificing the preservation of local and structural regions. Critically, these methods overlook the significance of the query patches in achieving accurate feature aggregation and temporal coherence. In contrast, TokenWarping leverages complementary token priors by constructing temporal correlations across different frames. Our method begins by extracting optical flows from source videos. During the denoising process of the diffusion model, these optical flows are used to warp the previous frame's query, key, and value patches, aligning them with the current frame's patches. By directly warping the query patches, we enhance feature aggregation in self-attention, while warping the key and value patches ensures temporal consistency across frames. This token warping imposes explicit constraints on the self-attention layer outputs, effectively ensuring temporally coherent translation. Our framework does not require any additional training or fine-tuning and can be seamlessly integrated with existing text-to-image editing methods. We conduct extensive experiments on various video translation tasks, demonstrating that TokenWarping surpasses state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Video demonstrations are available in supplementary materials.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Phased One-Step Adversarial Equilibrium for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21019v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion generation suffers from critical sampling efficiency bottlenecks, particularly for large-scale models and long contexts. Existing video acceleration methods, adapted from image-based techniques, lack a single-step distillation ability for large-scale video models and task generalization for conditional downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose the Video Phased Adversarial Equilibrium (V-PAE), a distillation framework that enables high-quality, single-step video generation from large-scale video models. Our approach employs a two-phase process. (i) Stability priming is a warm-up process to align the distributions of real and generated videos. It improves the stability of single-step adversarial distillation in the following process. (ii) Unified adversarial equilibrium is a flexible self-adversarial process that reuses generator parameters for the discriminator backbone. It achieves a co-evolutionary adversarial equilibrium in the Gaussian noise space. For the conditional tasks, we primarily preserve video-image subject consistency, which is caused by semantic degradation and conditional frame collapse during the distillation training in image-to-video (I2V) generation. Comprehensive experiments on VBench-I2V demonstrate that V-PAE outperforms existing acceleration methods by an average of 5.8% in the overall quality score, including semantic alignment, temporal coherence, and frame quality. In addition, our approach reduces the diffusion latency of the large-scale video model (e.g., Wan2.1-I2V-14B) by 100 times, while preserving competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026.

| **[Physically Realistic Sequence-Level Adversarial Clothing for Robust Human-Detection Evasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16020v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive Query Prompting for Multi-Domain Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01194v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical landmark detection is crucial in various medical imaging modalities and procedures. Although deep learning-based methods have achieve promising performance, they are mostly designed for specific anatomical regions or tasks. In this work, we propose a universal model for multi-domain landmark detection by leveraging transformer architecture and developing a prompting component, named as Adaptive Query Prompting (AQP). Instead of embedding additional modules in the backbone network, we design a separate module to generate prompts that can be effectively extended to any other transformer network. In our proposed AQP, prompts are learnable parameters maintained in a memory space called prompt pool. The central idea is to keep the backbone frozen and then optimize prompts to instruct the model inference process. Furthermore, we employ a lightweight decoder to decode landmarks from the extracted features, namely Light-MLD. Thanks to the lightweight nature of the decoder and AQP, we can handle multiple datasets by sharing the backbone encoder and then only perform partial parameter tuning without incurring much additional cost. It has the potential to be extended to more landmark detection tasks. We conduct experiments on three widely used X-ray datasets for different medical landmark detection tasks. Our proposed Light-MLD coupled with AQP achieves SOTA performance on many metrics even without the use of elaborate structural designs or complex frameworks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Automated Interpretable 2D Video Extraction from 3D Echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15946v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo) |

Existing WSSS methods struggle with precise object boundary localization and focus only on the most discriminative regions. To address these challenges, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement using object proposals to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete object coverage; (2) Influence Function Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model predictions; and (3) Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement with progressive refinement strategies. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 with 82.3% mIoU before post-processing, improving to 86.6% after CRF refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS methods. Extensive ablation studies validate each component's contribution, establishing IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VIDSTAMP: A Temporally-Aware Watermark for Ownership and Integrity in Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01406v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models can generate realistic and temporally consistent videos. This raises concerns about provenance, ownership, and integrity. Watermarking can help address these issues by embedding metadata directly into the content. To work well, a watermark needs enough capacity for meaningful metadata. It must also stay imperceptible and remain robust to common video manipulations. Existing methods struggle with limited capacity, extra inference cost, or reduced visual quality. We introduce VidStamp, a watermarking framework that embeds frame-level messages through the decoder of a latent video diffusion model. The decoder is fine-tuned in two stages. The first stage uses static image datasets to encourage spatial message separation. The second stage uses synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency. This approach enables high-capacity watermarks with minimal perceptual impact. VidStamp also supports dynamic watermarking through a control signal that selects message templates during inference. This adds flexibility and creates a second channel for communication. We evaluate VidStamp on Stable Video Diffusion (I2V), OpenSora, and Wan (T2V). The system embeds 48 bits per frame while preserving visual quality and staying robust to common distortions. Compared with VideoSeal, VideoShield, and RivaGAN, it achieves lower log P-values and stronger detectability. Its frame-wise watermarking design also enables precise temporal tamper localization, with an accuracy of 0.96, which exceeds the VideoShield baseline.

| **[OWT: A Foundational Organ-Wise Tokenization Framework for Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04899v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in representation learning often rely on holistic embeddings that entangle multiple semantic components, limiting interpretability and generalization. These issues are especially critical in medical imaging, where downstream tasks depend on anatomically interpretable features. To address these limitations, we propose an Organ-Wise Tokenization (OWT) framework with a Token Group-based Reconstruction (TGR) training paradigm. Unlike conventional approaches, OWT explicitly disentangles an image into separable token groups, each corresponding to a distinct organ or semantic entity. Our design ensures each token group encapsulates organ-specific information, boosting interpretability, generalization, and efficiency while enabling fine-grained control for targeted clinical applications. Experiments on CT and MRI datasets demonstrate OWT's power: it not only achieves strong performance on standard tasks like image reconstruction and segmentation, but also unlocks novel, high-impact clinical capabilities including organ-specific tumor identification, organ-level retrieval and semantic-level generation, without requiring any additional training. These findings underscore the potential of OWT as a foundational framework for semantically disentangled representation learning, offering broad scalability and a new perspective on how representations can be leveraged.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Shape and Texture Recognition in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23062v4)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shapes and textures are the basic building blocks of visual perception. The ability to identify shapes regardless of orientation, texture, or context, and to recognize textures and materials independently of their associated objects, is essential for a general visual understanding of the world. This work introduces the Large Shape and Textures dataset (LAS&T), a giant collection of highly diverse shapes and textures, created by unsupervised extraction of patterns from natural images. This dataset is used to benchmark how effectively leading Large Vision-Language Models (VLM) recognize and represent shapes, textures, and materials in 2D and 3D scenes. For shape recognition, we test the models' ability to match images of identical shapes that differ in orientation, texture, color, or environment. Our results show that the shape recognition capabilities of the LVLMs remain significantly below human performance. VLMs rely predominantly on high-level and semantic features and struggle with abstract shapes lacking class associations. For texture and material recognition, we evaluated the models' ability to identify images with identical textures and materials across different objects and environments. Interestingly, leading LVLMs approach human-level performance in recognizing materials in 3D scenes, yet substantially underperform humans when identifying simpler, more abstract 2D textures and shapes. These results are consistent across a wide range of leading LVLMs (GPT/Gemini/Qwen) and foundation vision models (DINO/CLIP), exposing major deficiencies in the ability of leading models to extract and represent low-level visual features. In contrast, humans and simple nets trained directly for these tasks achieve high accuracy. The LAS&T dataset, featuring over 700,000 images for 2D/3D shape, texture, and material recognition and retrieval is freely available.</p></details> |  | None |

There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings. To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce a benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5) a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics, with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5 Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2026 International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC2026)</p></details> | None |

Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment.

Efforts to mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, an evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe surpasses all baselines by 22% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two datasets for culturally universal concepts, one comprising T2I-generated outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> | None |

However, its performance on ultrasound images is significantly degraded due to domain disparities. This limitation raises two critical challenges: how to efficiently adapt SAM2 to ultrasound imaging while maintaining parameter efficiency, and how to deploy the adapted model effectively in resource-constrained clinical environments. To address these issues, we propose UniUltra for universal ultrasound segmentation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel context-edge hybrid adapter (CH-Adapter) that enhances fine-grained perception across diverse ultrasound imaging modalities while achieving parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To further improve clinical applicability, we develop a deep-supervised knowledge distillation (DSKD) technique that transfers knowledge from the large image encoder of the fine-tuned SAM2 to a super lightweight encoder, substantially reducing computational requirements without compromising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUltra outperforms state-of-the-arts with superior generalization capabilities. Notably, our framework achieves competitive performance using only 8.91% of SAM2's parameters during fine-tuning, and the final compressed model reduces the parameter count by 94.08% compared to the original SAM2, making it highly suitable for practical clinical deployment.

Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models, revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of $512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and $4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than zero-shot methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we revisit the geolocalization task, which requires not only nuanced visual grounding but also web search to confirm or refine hypotheses during reasoning. Since existing geolocalization benchmarks fail to meet the need for high-resolution imagery and the localization challenge for deep agentic reasoning, we curate GeoBench, a benchmark that includes photos and panoramas from around the world, along with a subset of satellite images of different cities to rigorously evaluate the geolocalization ability of agentic models. We also propose GeoVista, an agentic model that seamlessly integrates tool invocation within the reasoning loop, including an image-zoom-in tool to magnify regions of interest and a web-search tool to retrieve related web information. We develop a complete training pipeline for it, including a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to learn reasoning patterns and tool-use priors, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to further enhance reasoning ability. We adopt a hierarchical reward to leverage multi-level geographical information and improve overall geolocalization performance. Experimental results show that GeoVista surpasses other open-source agentic models on the geolocalization task greatly and achieves performance comparable to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-5 on most metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

These models still fail to infer structured transformation rules from a handful of examples, which is a key hallmark of human intelligence. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) provides a rigorous testbed for this capability, demanding conceptual rule induction and transfer to novel tasks. Most existing methods treat ARC-AGI as a purely textual reasoning task, overlooking the fact that humans rely heavily on visual abstraction when solving such puzzles. However, our pilot experiments reveal a paradox: naively rendering ARC-AGI grids as images degrades performance due to imprecise rule execution. This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach yields up to a 4.33% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks. Our findings suggest that unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is a crucial step toward achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models.

| **[Joint Semantic-Channel Coding and Modulation for Token Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15699v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the Transformer architecture has achieved outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and modalities. Token is the unified input and output representation in Transformer-based models, which has become a fundamental information unit. In this work, we consider the problem of token communication, studying how to transmit tokens efficiently and reliably. Point cloud, a prevailing three-dimensional format which exhibits a more complex spatial structure compared to image or video, is chosen to be the information source. We utilize the set abstraction method to obtain point tokens. Subsequently, to get a more informative and transmission-friendly representation based on tokens, we propose a joint semantic-channel and modulation (JSCCM) scheme for the token encoder, mapping point tokens to standard digital constellation points (modulated tokens). Specifically, the JSCCM consists of two parallel Point Transformer-based encoders and a differential modulator which combines the Gumel-softmax and soft quantization methods. Besides, the rate allocator and channel adapter are developed, facilitating adaptive generation of high-quality modulated tokens conditioned on both semantic information and channel conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both joint semantic-channel coding and traditional separate coding, achieving over 1dB gain in reconstruction and more than 6x compression ratio in modulated symbols.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[DeepContrast: Deep Tissue Contrast Enhancement using Synthetic Data Degradations and OOD Model Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08365v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopy images are crucial for life science research, allowing detailed inspection and characterization of cellular and tissue-level structures and functions. However, microscopy data are unavoidably affected by image degradations, such as noise, blur, or others. Many such degradations also contribute to a loss of image contrast, which becomes especially pronounced in deeper regions of thick samples. Today, best performing methods to increase the quality of images are based on Deep Learning approaches, which typically require ground truth (GT) data during training. Our inability to counteract blurring and contrast loss when imaging deep into samples prevents the acquisition of such clean GT data. The fact that the forward process of blurring and contrast loss deep into tissue can be modeled, allowed us to propose a new method that can circumvent the problem of unobtainable GT data. To this end, we first synthetically degraded the quality of microscopy images even further by using an approximate forward model for deep tissue image degradations. Then we trained a neural network that learned the inverse of this degradation function from our generated pairs of raw and degraded images. We demonstrated that networks trained in this way can be used out-of-distribution (OOD) to improve the quality of less severely degraded images, e.g. the raw data imaged in a microscope. Since the absolute level of degradation in such microscopy images can be stronger than the additional degradation introduced by our forward model, we also explored the effect of iterative predictions. Here, we observed that in each iteration the measured image contrast kept improving while detailed structures in the images got increasingly removed. Therefore, dependent on the desired downstream analysis, a balance between contrast improvement and retention of image details has to be found.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

However, existing RL approaches often rely on human-annotated labels or task-specific heuristics to define verifiable rewards, both of which are costly and difficult to scale. We introduce VisPlay, a self-evolving RL framework that enables VLMs to autonomously improve their reasoning abilities using large amounts of unlabeled image data. Starting from a single base VLM, VisPlay assigns the model into two interacting roles: an Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging yet answerable visual questions, and a Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses. These roles are jointly trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which incorporates diversity and difficulty rewards to balance the complexity of generated questions with the quality of the silver answers. VisPlay scales efficiently across two model families. When trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL, VisPlay achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks, including MM-Vet and MMMU, demonstrating a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence.

However, despite these promising results, there is still no systematic analysis of how thinking actually affects visual reasoning. We provide the first such analysis with a large scale, controlled comparison of thinking for LVLMs, evaluating ten variants from the InternVL3.5 and Qwen3-VL families on MMMU-val under generous token budgets and multi pass decoding. We show that more thinking is not always better; long chains often yield long wrong trajectories that ignore the image and underperform the same models run in standard instruct mode. A deeper analysis reveals that certain short lookback phrases, which explicitly refer back to the image, are strongly enriched in successful trajectories and correlate with better visual grounding. Building on this insight, we propose uncertainty guided lookback, a training free decoding strategy that combines an uncertainty signal with adaptive lookback prompts and breadth search. Our method improves overall MMMU performance, delivers the largest gains in categories where standard thinking is weak, and outperforms several strong decoding baselines, setting a new state of the art under fixed model families and token budgets. We further show that this decoding strategy generalizes, yielding consistent improvements on five additional benchmarks, including two broad multimodal suites and math focused visual reasoning datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

This rigid design limits both feature sharing and semantic generalization. In this work, we propose a unified decoupled segmentation head that separates multi-class prediction into class-agnostic mask prediction and class label prediction using shared object queries. Furthermore, we introduce a Full-Scale Aware Deformable Transformer module that enables low-resolution encoder features to attend across full-resolution encoder features via deformable attention, achieving memory-efficient and spatially aligned full-scale fusion. Our proposed method, named MaskMed, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing nnUNet by +2.0% Dice on AMOS 2022 and +6.9% Dice on BTCV.</p></details> |  | None |

However, ultrasound suffers from inherent limitations in visualizing complete vertebral anatomy, in particular vertebral bodies, due to acoustic shadowing effects caused by bone. In this work, we present a novel multi-modal deep learning method for completing occluded anatomical structures in 3D ultrasound by leveraging complementary information from a single X-ray image. To enable training, we generate paired training data consisting of: (1) 2D lateral vertebral views that simulate X-ray scans, and (2) 3D partial vertebrae representations that mimic the limited visibility and occlusions encountered during ultrasound spine imaging. Our method integrates morphological information from both imaging modalities and demonstrates significant improvements in vertebral reconstruction (p < 0.001) compared to state of art in 3D ultrasound vertebral completion. We perform phantom studies as an initial step to future clinical translation, and achieve a more accurate, complete volumetric lumbar spine visualization overlayed on the ultrasound scan without the need for registration with preoperative modalities such as computed tomography. This demonstrates that integrating a single X-ray projection mitigates ultrasound's key limitation while preserving its strengths as the primary imaging modality.

In view of antiforensics, it is significant to develop advanced adversarial attacks for evaluating the security of such detectors, which remains unexplored sufficiently. This letter proposes a Dual-domain Feature Importance Attack (DuFIA) scheme to invalidate AIGI detectors to some extent. Forensically important features are captured by the spatially interpolated gradient and frequency-aware perturbation. The adversarial transferability is enhanced by jointly modeling spatial and frequency-domain feature importances, which are fused to guide the optimization-based adversarial example generation. Extensive experiments across various AIGI detectors verify the cross-model transferability, transparency and robustness of DuFIA.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce Mera Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (image-to-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking and licenses for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.</p></details> |  | None |

However, variations in patient anatomy and complex human-in-the-loop interactions pose significant challenges for autonomous robotic scanning. Existing ultrasound scanning robots are commonly limited to relatively low generalization and inefficient data utilization. To overcome these limitations, we present UltraDP, a Diffusion-Policy-based method that receives multi-sensory inputs (ultrasound images, wrist camera images, contact wrench, and probe pose) and generates actions that are fit for multi-modal action distributions in autonomous ultrasound scanning of carotid artery. We propose a specialized guidance module to enable the policy to output actions that center the artery in ultrasound images. To ensure stable contact and safe interaction between the robot and the human subject, a hybrid force-impedance controller is utilized to drive the robot to track such trajectories. Also, we have built a large-scale training dataset for carotid scanning comprising 210 scans with 460k sample pairs from 21 volunteers of both genders. By exploring our guidance module and DP's strong generalization ability, UltraDP achieves a 95% success rate in transverse scanning on previously unseen subjects, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches often suffer from inefficiency, either due to token-by-token decoding or the complexity of multi-scale representations. In this work, we introduce Expanding Autoregressive Representation (EAR), a novel generation paradigm that emulates the human visual system's center-outward perception pattern. EAR unfolds image tokens in a spiral order from the center and progressively expands outward, preserving spatial continuity and enabling efficient parallel decoding. To further enhance flexibility and speed, we propose a length-adaptive decoding strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens predicted at each step. This biologically inspired design not only reduces computational cost but also improves generation quality by aligning the generation order with perceptual relevance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that EAR achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between fidelity and efficiency on single-scale autoregressive models, setting a new direction for scalable and cognitively aligned autoregressive image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, includes appendix with additional visualizations, submitted as arXiv preprint</p></details> | None |

Mainstream ADFMs rely on end-to-end learning and heavily synthesized datasets to achieve degradation awareness and fusion. This rough learning strategy and non-real world scenario dataset dependence often limit their upper-bound performance, leading to low-quality results. To address these limitations, we present LURE, a Learning-driven Unified REpresentation model for infrared and visible image fusion, which is degradation-aware. LURE learns a Unified Latent Feature Space (ULFS) to avoid the dependency on complex data formats inherent in previous end-to-end learning pipelines. It further improves image fusion quality by leveraging the intrinsic relationships between multi-modalities. A novel loss function is also proposed to drive the learning of unified latent representations more stable.More importantly, LURE seamlessly incorporates existing high-quality real-world image restoration datasets. To further enhance the model's representation capability, we design a simple yet effective structure, termed internal residual block, to facilitate the learning of latent features. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across general fusion, degradation-aware fusion, and downstream tasks.

In this paper, we demonstrate how a reinforcement learning (RL) agent can learn a new class of attack algorithms that generate adversarial samples. Unlike traditional adversarial machine learning (AML) methods that craft adversarial samples independently, our RL-based approach retains and exploits past attack experience to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of future attacks. We formulate adversarial sample generation as a Markov Decision Process and evaluate RL's ability to (a) learn effective and efficient attack strategies and (b) compete with state-of-the-art AML. On two image classification benchmarks, our agent increases attack success rate by up to 13.2% and decreases the average number of victim model queries per attack by up to 16.9% from the start to the end of training. In a head-to-head comparison with state-of-the-art image attacks, our approach enables an adversary to generate adversarial samples with 17% more success on unseen inputs post-training. From a security perspective, this work demonstrates a powerful new attack vector that uses RL to train agents that attack ML models efficiently and at scale.</p></details> |  | None |

Such reasoning-related annotations are essential for developing and evaluating explainable AI (xAI) models that reason similarly to radiologists: making correct predictions for the right reasons. To address this gap, we introduce FunnyNodules, a fully parameterized synthetic dataset designed for systematic analysis of attribute-based reasoning in medical AI models. The dataset generates abstract, lung nodule-like shapes with controllable visual attributes such as roundness, margin sharpness, and spiculation. Target class is derived from a predefined attribute combination, allowing full control over the decision rule that links attributes to the diagnostic class. We demonstrate how FunnyNodules can be used in model-agnostic evaluations to assess whether models learn correct attribute-target relations, to interpret over- or underperformance in attribute prediction, and to analyze attention alignment with attribute-specific regions of interest. The framework is fully customizable, supporting variations in dataset complexity, target definitions, class balance, and beyond. With complete ground truth information, FunnyNodules provides a versatile foundation for developing, benchmarking, and conducting in-depth analyses of explainable AI methods in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

All tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have established minimum standards to use electronic monitoring (EM) in fisheries in addition to traditional observers. The EM systems produce a massive amount of video data that human analysts must process. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflow can decrease that workload and improve the accuracy of the reports. However, species identification still poses significant challenges for AI, as achieving balanced performance across all species requires appropriate training data. Here, we quantify the difficulty experts face to distinguish bigeye tuna (BET, Thunnus Obesus) from yellowfin tuna (YFT, Thunnus Albacares) using images captured by EM systems. We found inter-expert agreements of 42.9% $\pm$ 35.6% for BET and 57.1% $\pm$ 35.6% for YFT. We then present a multi-stage pipeline to estimate the species composition of the catches using a reliable ground-truth dataset based on identifications made by observers on board. Three segmentation approaches are compared: Mask R-CNN, a combination of DINOv2 with SAM2, and a integration of YOLOv9 with SAM2. We found that the latest performs the best, with a validation mean average precision of 0.66 $\pm$ 0.03 and a recall of 0.88 $\pm$ 0.03. Segmented individuals are tracked using ByteTrack. For classification, we evaluate a standard multiclass classification model and a hierarchical approach, finding a superior generalization by the hierarchical. All our models were cross-validated during training and tested on fishing operations with fully known catch composition. Combining YOLOv9-SAM2 with the hierarchical classification produced the best estimations, with 84.8% of the individuals being segmented and classified with a mean average error of 4.5%.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures | None |

A key step is the quality inspection of disassembled components, which is mostly done manually due to the high variety of parts and defect patterns. Deep neural networks show great potential to automate such visual inspection tasks but struggle to generalize to new product variants, components, or defect patterns. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel image dataset depicting typical gearbox components in good and defective condition from two automotive transmissions. Depending on the train-test split of the data, different distribution shifts are generated to benchmark the generalization ability of a classification model. We evaluate different models using the dataset and propose a contrastive regularization loss to enhance model robustness. The results obtained demonstrate the ability of the loss to improve generalisation to unseen types of components.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often lack an understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate negative space. Furthermore, the absence of negative labels semantically similar to ID labels constrains their capability in near-OOD detection. To address these issues, we propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we cache images likely to be OOD samples from the historical test images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the in-distribution (ID) subset, we cache the subset of ID classes that are visually similar to historical test images and then leverage MLLM reasoning to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task settings (near-OOD and far-OOD), making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 3.1\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot, enabling high scalability.</p></details> |  | None |

While DFQ has shown promise for unimodal models, its extension to Vision-Language Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models remains underexplored. In this work, we reveal that directly applying existing DFQ techniques to CLIP results in substantial performance degradation due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic content and low intra-image diversity in synthesized samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose D4C, the first DFQ framework tailored for CLIP. D4C synthesizes semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through three key components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection aligns generated images with real-world semantics using text prompts; (2) Structural Contrastive Generation reproduces compositional structures of natural images by leveraging foreground-background contrastive synthesis; and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement applies controlled perturbations to improve sample diversity and robustness. These components jointly empower D4C to synthesize images that are both semantically informative and structurally diverse, effectively bridging the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of D4C, showing significant performance improvements on various bit-widths and models. For example, under the W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, D4C achieves Top-1 accuracy improvement of 12.4% and 18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8% and 19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4% and 5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models' ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.

With its near-real-time availability, STEREO/HI beacon data is the perfect candidate for early forecasting of CMEs. However, previous work concluded that CME arrival prediction based on beacon data could not achieve the same accuracy as with high-resolution science data due to data gaps and lower quality. We present our novel machine-learning pipeline entitled ``Beacon2Science'', bridging the gap between beacon and science data to improve CME tracking. Through this pipeline, we first enhance the quality (signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution) of beacon data. We then increase the time resolution of enhanced beacon images through learned interpolation to match science data's 40-minute resolution. We maximize information coherence between consecutive frames with adapted model architecture and loss functions through the different steps. The improved beacon images are comparable to science data, showing better CME visibility than the original beacon data. Furthermore, we compare CMEs tracked in beacon, enhanced beacon, and science images.

| **[Taming Generative Synthetic Data for X-ray Prohibited Item Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15299v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training prohibited item detection models requires a large amount of X-ray security images, but collecting and annotating these images is time-consuming and laborious. To address data insufficiency, X-ray security image synthesis methods composite images to scale up datasets. However, previous methods primarily follow a two-stage pipeline, where they implement labor-intensive foreground extraction in the first stage and then composite images in the second stage. Such a pipeline introduces inevitable extra labor cost and is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a one-stage X-ray security image synthesis pipeline (Xsyn) based on text-to-image generation, which incorporates two effective strategies to improve the usability of synthetic images. The Cross-Attention Refinement (CAR) strategy leverages the cross-attention map from the diffusion model to refine the bounding box annotation. The Background Occlusion Modeling (BOM) strategy explicitly models background occlusion in the latent space to enhance imaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, compared with previous methods, Xsyn is the first to achieve high-quality X-ray security image synthesis without extra labor cost. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all previous methods with 1.2% mAP improvement, and the synthetic images generated by our method are beneficial to improve prohibited item detection performance across various X-ray security datasets and detectors.

Typical benchmarks limited in data diversity and assume access to complete chart code, which is seldom in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we present ChartEditVista, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 7,964 samples spanning 31 chart categories. It encompasses diverse editing instructions and covers nearly all editable chart elements. The inputs in ChartEditVista include only the original chart image and natural language editing instructions, without the original chart codes. ChartEditVista is generated through a fully automated pipeline that produces, edits, and verifies charts, ensuring high-quality chart editing data. Besides, we introduce two novel fine-grained, rule-based evaluation metrics: the layout metric, which evaluates the position, size and color of graphical components; and the text metric, which jointly assesses textual content and font styling. Building on top of ChartEditVista, we present ChartEditor, a model trained using a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a novel rendering reward to simultaneously enforce code executability and visual fidelity. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we demonstrate that ChartEditVista provides a robust evaluation, while ChartEditor consistently outperforms models with similar-scale and larger-scale on chart editing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to AAAI 2026 Main Track</p></details> | None |

We propose a label-efficient segmentation approach that promotes cross-modality generalization under real-world conditions, where GED4 hepatobiliary-phase annotations are limited, non-contrast sequences (T1WI, T2WI, DWI) are unlabeled, and spatial misalignment and missing phases are common. Our method integrates a foundation-scale 3D segmentation backbone adapted via fine-tuning, co-training with cross pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled volumes, and a standardized preprocessing pipeline. Without requiring spatial registration, the model learns to generalize across MRI phases and vendors, demonstrating robust segmentation performance in both labeled and unlabeled domains. Our results exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed label-efficient baseline for liver segmentation in multi-phase, multi-vendor MRI and highlight the potential of combining foundation model adaptation with co-training for real-world clinical imaging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CARE @ MICCAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing SDXL-based methods struggle to achieve high-quality results, while the recently proposed Flux model fails to achieve effective content-style separation due to its underexplored characteristics. To address these challenges, we conduct a systematic analysis of Flux and make two key observations: (1) Single Dream Blocks are essential for image generation; and (2) Early single stream blocks mainly control content, whereas later blocks govern style. Based on these insights, we propose SplitFlux, which disentangles content and style by fine-tuning the single dream blocks via LoRA, enabling the disentangled content to be re-embedded into new contexts. It includes two key components: (1) Rank-Constrained Adaptation. To preserve content identity and structure, we compress the rank and amplify the magnitude of updates within specific blocks, preventing content leakage into style blocks. (2) Visual-Gated LoRA. We split the content LoRA into two branches with different ranks, guided by image saliency. The high-rank branch preserves primary subject information, while the low-rank branch encodes residual details, mitigating content overfitting and enabling seamless re-embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitFlux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior content preservation and stylization quality across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross Modal Fine-Grained Alignment via Granularity-Aware and Region-Uncertain Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07710v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained image-text alignment is a pivotal challenge in multimodal learning, underpinning key applications such as visual question answering, image captioning, and vision-language navigation. Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, existing research and evaluation standards predominantly focus on image realism and shallow text-image alignment, lacking a comprehensive assessment of complex semantic understanding and world knowledge integration in text-to-image generation. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{WISE}, the first benchmark specifically designed for \textbf{W}orld Knowledge-\textbf{I}nformed \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{E}valuation. WISE moves beyond simple word-pixel mapping by challenging models with 1000 meticulously crafted prompts across 25 subdomains in cultural common sense, spatio-temporal reasoning, and natural science. To overcome the limitations of traditional CLIP metric, we introduce \textbf{WiScore}, a novel quantitative metric for assessing knowledge-image alignment. Through comprehensive testing of 20 models (10 dedicated T2I models and 10 unified multimodal models) using 1,000 structured prompts spanning 25 subdomains, our findings reveal significant limitations in their ability to effectively integrate and apply world knowledge during image generation, highlighting critical pathways for enhancing knowledge incorporation and application in next-generation T2I models.

| **[GeoMVD: Geometry-Enhanced Multi-View Generation Model Based on Geometric Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12204v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view image generation holds significant application value in computer vision, particularly in domains like 3D reconstruction, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Most existing methods, which rely on extending single images, face notable computational challenges in maintaining cross-view consistency and generating high-resolution outputs. To address these issues, we propose the Geometry-guided Multi-View Diffusion Model, which incorporates mechanisms for extracting multi-view geometric information and adjusting the intensity of geometric features to generate images that are both consistent across views and rich in detail. Specifically, we design a multi-view geometry information extraction module that leverages depth maps, normal maps, and foreground segmentation masks to construct a shared geometric structure, ensuring shape and structural consistency across different views. To enhance consistency and detail restoration during generation, we develop a decoupled geometry-enhanced attention mechanism that strengthens feature focus on key geometric details, thereby improving overall image quality and detail preservation. Furthermore, we apply an adaptive learning strategy that fine-tunes the model to better capture spatial relationships and visual coherence between the generated views, ensuring realistic results. Our model also incorporates an iterative refinement process that progressively improves the output quality through multiple stages of image generation. Finally, a dynamic geometry information intensity adjustment mechanism is proposed to adaptively regulate the influence of geometric data, optimizing overall quality while ensuring the naturalness of generated images.

For a random matrix following a matrix-variate elliptically contoured distribution, we show that the eigenspaces of the proposed row/column matrix Kendall's tau coincide with those of the row/column scatter matrix respectively, with the same descending order of the eigenvalues. We perform eigenvalue decomposition to the generalized row/column matrix Kendall's tau for recovering the loading spaces of the matrix factor model. We also propose to estimate the pair of the factor numbers by exploiting the eigenvalue-ratios of the row/column matrix Kendall's tau. Theoretically, we derive the convergence rates of the estimators for loading spaces, factor scores and common components, and prove the consistency of the estimators for the factor numbers without any moment constraints on the idiosyncratic errors. Thorough simulation studies are conducted to show the higher degree of robustness of the proposed estimators over the existing ones. Analysis of a financial dataset of asset returns and a medical imaging dataset associated with COVID-19 illustrate the empirical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VIRAL: Visual Sim-to-Real at Scale for Humanoid Loco-Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15200v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key barrier to the real-world deployment of humanoid robots is the lack of autonomous loco-manipulation skills. We introduce VIRAL, a visual sim-to-real framework that learns humanoid loco-manipulation entirely in simulation and deploys it zero-shot to real hardware. VIRAL follows a teacher-student design: a privileged RL teacher, operating on full state, learns long-horizon loco-manipulation using a delta action space and reference state initialization. A vision-based student policy is then distilled from the teacher via large-scale simulation with tiled rendering, trained with a mixture of online DAgger and behavior cloning. We find that compute scale is critical: scaling simulation to tens of GPUs (up to 64) makes both teacher and student training reliable, while low-compute regimes often fail. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, VIRAL combines large-scale visual domain randomization over lighting, materials, camera parameters, image quality, and sensor delays--with real-to-sim alignment of the dexterous hands and cameras. Deployed on a Unitree G1 humanoid, the resulting RGB-based policy performs continuous loco-manipulation for up to 54 cycles, generalizing to diverse spatial and appearance variations without any real-world fine-tuning, and approaching expert-level teleoperation performance. Extensive ablations dissect the key design choices required to make RGB-based humanoid loco-manipulation work in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://viral-humanoid.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, vanilla MAR suffers from slow inference due to its hierarchical inference mechanism: an outer AR unmasking loop and an inner diffusion denoising chain. Such decoupled structure not only harm the generation efficiency but also hinder the practical use of MAR for reinforcement learning (RL), an increasingly critical paradigm for generative model post-training.To address this fundamental issue, we introduce MARVAL (Masked Auto-regressive Variational Acceleration), a distillation-based framework that compresses the diffusion chain into a single AR generation step while preserving the flexible auto-regressive unmasking order. Such a distillation with MARVAL not only yields substantial inference acceleration but, crucially, makes RL post-training with verifiable rewards practical, resulting in scalable yet human-preferred fast generative models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel score-based variational objective for distilling masked auto-regressive diffusion models into a single generation step without sacrificing sample quality; and (2) an efficient RL framework for masked auto-regressive models via MARVAL-RL. On ImageNet 256*256, MARVAL-Huge achieves an FID of 2.00 with more than 30 times speedup compared with MAR-diffusion, and MARVAL-RL yields consistent improvements in CLIP and image-reward scores on ImageNet datasets with entity names. In conclusion, MARVAL demonstrates the first practical path to distillation and RL of masked auto-regressive diffusion models, enabling fast sampling and better preference alignments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Instruction-Guided Lesion Segmentation for Chest X-rays with Automatically Generated Large-Scale Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15186v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The applicability of current lesion segmentation models for chest X-rays (CXRs) has been limited both by a small number of target labels and the reliance on long, detailed expert-level text inputs, creating a barrier to practical use. To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm: instruction-guided lesion segmentation (ILS), which is designed to segment diverse lesion types based on simple, user-friendly instructions. Under this paradigm, we construct MIMIC-ILS, the first large-scale instruction-answer dataset for CXR lesion segmentation, using our fully automated multimodal pipeline that generates annotations from chest X-ray images and their corresponding reports. MIMIC-ILS contains 1.1M instruction-answer pairs derived from 192K images and 91K unique segmentation masks, covering seven major lesion types. To empirically demonstrate its utility, we introduce ROSALIA, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MIMIC-ILS. ROSALIA can segment diverse lesions and provide textual explanations in response to user instructions. The model achieves high segmentation and textual accuracy in our newly proposed task, highlighting the effectiveness of our pipeline and the value of MIMIC-ILS as a foundational resource for pixel-level CXR lesion grounding.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method, named Uncertainty-aware Adaptive Distillation (UAD) for the multi-source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (MSFDA) setting. UAD aims to perform well-calibrated knowledge distillation from (i) model level to deliver coordinated and reliable base model initialisation and (ii) instance level via model adaptation guided by high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby obtaining a high-performance target domain model. To verify its general applicability, we evaluate UAD on two image-based diagnosis benchmarks among two multi-centre datasets, where our method shows a significant performance gain compared with existing works.

Traditional methods, such as extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component, utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba, which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene) instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening the alignment across modalities. By jointly modeling fine-grained and structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art performance in gene expression prediction.

Many recent approaches attempt to introduce the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to handle this task. With the strong generalization ability and rich object-specific extraction ability of the SAM model, such a solution shows great potential in few-shot segmentation. However, the decoding process of SAM highly relies on accurate and explicit prompts, making previous approaches mainly focus on extracting prompts from the support set, which is insufficient to activate the generalization ability of SAM, and this design is easy to result in a biased decoding process when adapting to the unknown classes. In this work, we propose an Unbiased Semantic Decoding (USD) strategy integrated with SAM, which extracts target information from both the support and query set simultaneously to perform consistent predictions guided by the semantics of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model. Specifically, to enhance the unbiased semantic discrimination of SAM, we design two feature enhancement strategies that leverage the semantic alignment capability of CLIP to enrich the original SAM features, mainly including a global supplement at the image level to provide a generalize category indicate with support image and a local guidance at the pixel level to provide a useful target location with query image. Besides, to generate target-focused prompt embeddings, a learnable visual-text target prompt generator is proposed by interacting target text embeddings and clip visual features. Without requiring re-training of the vision foundation models, the features with semantic discrimination draw attention to the target region through the guidance of prompt with rich target information.</p></details> |  | None |

The recently proposed Leffa technology has addressed the texture distortion problem of diffusion-based models, but there are limitations in that the bottom detection inaccuracy and the existing clothing silhouette persist in the synthesis results. To solve this problem, this study proposes CaP-VTON (Clothing Agnostic Pre-Inpainting Virtual Try-On). CaP-VTON integrates DressCode-based multi-category masking and Stable Diffu-sion-based skin inflation preprocessing; in particular, a generated skin module was in-troduced to solve skin restoration problems that occur when long-sleeved images are con-verted to short-sleeved or sleeveless ones, introducing a preprocessing structure that im-proves the naturalness and consistency of full-body clothing synthesis, and allowing the implementation of high-quality restoration considering human posture and color. As a result, CaP-VTON achieved 92.5%, which is 15.4% better than Leffa, in short-sleeved syn-thesis accuracy, and consistently reproduced the style and shape of the reference clothing in visual evaluation. These structures maintain model-agnostic properties and are appli-cable to various diffusion-based virtual inspection systems; they can also contribute to applications that require high-precision virtual wearing, such as e-commerce, custom styling, and avatar creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github : https://github.com/DevChoco/CAP-VTON</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/DevChoco/CAP-VTON) |

Existing projection-based methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions. However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition, we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version needs major revision</p></details> | None |

Recent methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) have shown the potential to recover 3D geometry from 2D diffusion priors, but they typically suffer from time-consuming per-shape optimization and inconsistent geometry. In contrast, certain works directly produce 3D information via fast network inferences, but their results are often of low quality and lack geometric details. To holistically improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of single-view reconstruction tasks, we propose a cross-domain diffusion model that generates multi-view normal maps and the corresponding color images. To ensure the consistency of generation, we employ a multi-view cross-domain attention mechanism that facilitates information exchange across views and modalities. Lastly, we introduce a cascaded 3D mesh extraction algorithm that drives high-quality surfaces from the multi-view 2D representations in only about $3$ minute in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality reconstruction results, robust generalization, and good efficiency compared to prior works.

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

Although recent approaches perform well, rendering controllable bokeh without additional depth inputs remains a significant challenge. Existing classical and neural controllable methods rely on accurate depth maps, while generative approaches often struggle with limited controllability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose BokehFlow, a depth-free framework for controllable bokeh rendering based on flow matching. BokehFlow directly synthesizes photorealistic bokeh effects from all-in-focus images, eliminating the need for depth inputs. It employs a cross-attention mechanism to enable semantic control over both focus regions and blur intensity via text prompts. To support training and evaluation, we collect and synthesize four datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BokehFlow achieves visually compelling bokeh effects and offers precise control, outperforming existing depth-dependent and generative methods in both rendering quality and efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
