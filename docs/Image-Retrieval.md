| **[Adaptive Hopfield Network: Rethinking Similarities in Associative Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20609v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Associative memory models are content-addressable memory systems fundamental to biological intelligence and are notable for their high interpretability. However, existing models evaluate the quality of retrieval based on proximity, which cannot guarantee that the retrieved pattern has the strongest association with the query, failing correctness. We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased. We integrate this mechanism into a novel adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop), and empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including memory retrieval, tabular classification, image classification, and multiple instance learning.</p></details> |  | None |

One key bottleneck is the lack of diverse, multimodal olfactory training data collected in natural settings. We present New York Smells, a large dataset of paired image and olfactory signals captured ``in the wild.'' Our dataset contains 7,000 smell-image pairs from 3,500 distinct objects across indoor and outdoor environments, with approximately 70$\times$ more objects than existing olfactory datasets. Our benchmark has three tasks: cross-modal smell-to-image retrieval, recognizing scenes, objects, and materials from smell alone, and fine-grained discrimination between grass species. Through experiments on our dataset, we find that visual data enables cross-modal olfactory representation learning, and that our learned olfactory representations outperform widely-used hand-crafted features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://smell.cs.columbia.edu</p></details> | None |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v5)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adversarial Robustness for Unified Multi-Modal Encoders via Efficient Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11895v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent unified multi-modal encoders align a wide range of modalities into a shared representation space, enabling diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities, the robustness of these models under adversarial perturbations remains underexplored, which is a critical concern for safety-sensitive applications. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of adversarial vulnerability in unified multi-modal encoders. We find that even mild adversarial perturbations lead to substantial performance drops across all modalities. Non-visual inputs, such as audio and point clouds, are especially fragile, while visual inputs like images and videos also degrade significantly. To address this, we propose an efficient adversarial calibration framework that improves robustness across modalities without modifying pretrained encoders or semantic centers, ensuring compatibility with existing foundation models. Our method introduces modality-specific projection heads trained solely on adversarial examples, while keeping the backbone and embeddings frozen. We explore three training objectives: fixed-center cross-entropy, clean-to-adversarial L2 alignment, and clean-adversarial InfoNCE, and we introduce a regularization strategy to ensure modality-consistent alignment under attack. Experiments on six modalities and three Bind-style models show that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to 47.3 percent at epsilon = 4/255, while preserving or even improving clean zero-shot and retrieval performance with less than 1 percent trainable parameters.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Back to the Feature: Explaining Video Classifiers with Video Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20295v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are minimal and semantically meaningful modifications of the input of a model that alter the model predictions. They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video. Both optimization processes are guided solely by the target classifier, ensuring the explanation is faithful. To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps. Extensive experiments on video datasets such as Shape-Moving (motion classification), MEAD (emotion classification), and NTU RGB+D (action classification) show that our BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar and realistic counterfactual videos that provide concrete insights into the classifier's decision-making mechanism.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ScenarioCLIP: Pretrained Transferable Visual Language Models and Action-Genome Dataset for Natural Scene Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20274v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Until recently, the general corpus of CLIP-type fundamental models has widely explored either the retrieval of short descriptions or the classification of objects in the scene as SINGLE-object image classification task. The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods. ScenarioCLIP demonstrates robust zero-shot and finetune performance on various domain-specific tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/scenario-clip/ScenarioCLIP</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/scenario-clip/ScenarioCLIP) |
| **[Intelligent Image Search Algorithms Fusing Visual Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19920v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained image retrieval, which aims to find images containing specific object components and assess their detailed states, is critical in fields like security and industrial inspection. However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., "sun visor lowered"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., "driver wearing a mask") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines. It also attains 94.95\% accuracy in zero-shot search for driver mask-wearing and over 90\% average accuracy in state search tasks.</p></details> | 31 pages,7 figures | None |
| **[Large Language Model Aided Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome Diagnosis with Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19834v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods face dual challenges of limited clinical samples and low inter-class differentiation among Diffuse Cystic Lung Diseases (DCLDs) in advancing Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) diagnosis via Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate diagnostic potential fo such rare diseases, the absence of domain-specific knowledge and referable radiological features intensify hallucination risks. To address this problem, we propose BHD-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that integrates DCLD-specific expertise and clinical precedents with MLLMs to improve BHD diagnostic accuracy. BHDRAG employs: (1) a specialized agent generating imaging manifestation descriptions of CT images to construct a multimodal corpus of DCLDs cases. (2) a cosine similarity-based retriever pinpointing relevant imagedescription pairs for query images, and (3) an MLLM synthesizing retrieved evidence with imaging data for diagnosis. BHD-RAG is validated on the dataset involving four types of DCLDs, achieving superior accuracy and generating evidence-based descriptions closely aligned with expert insights.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Memory Self-Regeneration: Uncovering Hidden Knowledge in Unlearned Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03263v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive capability of modern text-to-image models to generate realistic visuals has come with a serious drawback: they can be misused to create harmful, deceptive or unlawful content. This has accelerated the push for machine unlearning. This new field seeks to selectively remove specific knowledge from a model's training data without causing a drop in its overall performance. However, it turns out that actually forgetting a given concept is an extremely difficult task. Models exposed to attacks using adversarial prompts show the ability to generate so-called unlearned concepts, which can be not only harmful but also illegal. In this paper, we present considerations regarding the ability of models to forget and recall knowledge, introducing the Memory Self-Regeneration task. Furthermore, we present MemoRa strategy, which we consider to be a regenerative approach supporting the effective recovery of previously lost knowledge. Moreover, we propose that robustness in knowledge retrieval is a crucial yet underexplored evaluation measure for developing more robust and effective unlearning techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that forgetting occurs in two distinct ways: short-term, where concepts can be quickly recalled, and long-term, where recovery is more challenging.

| **[Can Modern Vision Models Understand the Difference Between an Object and a Look-alike?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19200v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computer vision have yielded models with strong performance on recognition benchmarks; however, significant gaps remain in comparison to human perception. One subtle ability is to judge whether an image looks like a given object without being an instance of that object. We study whether vision-language models such as CLIP capture this distinction. We curated a dataset named RoLA (Real or Lookalike) of real and lookalike exemplars (e.g., toys, statues, drawings, pareidolia) across multiple categories, and first evaluate a prompt-based baseline with paired "real"/"lookalike" prompts. We then estimate a direction in CLIP's embedding space that moves representations between real and lookalike. Applying this direction to image and text embeddings improves discrimination in cross-modal retrieval on Conceptual12M, and also enhances captions produced by a CLIP prefix captioner.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MagicWorld: Interactive Geometry-driven Video World Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18886v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent interactive video world model methods generate scene evolution conditioned on user instructions. Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drive dynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce the Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D), which constructs a point cloud from the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints for viewpoint transitions and thereby improving structural consistency. We further propose History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional person ReID models are typically uni-modal, resulting in limited generalizability across heterogeneous data modalities. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has shown a promising avenue for addressing this issue. Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature extractors or caption generators, leaving their capabilities in person ReID tasks largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark for \underline{\textbf{V}}ersatile \underline{\textbf{P}}erson \underline{\textbf{Re}}-\underline{\textbf{ID}}entification, termed VP-ReID. The benchmark includes 257,310 multi-modal queries and gallery images, covering ten diverse person ReID tasks. In addition, we propose two task-oriented evaluation schemes for MLLM-based person ReID. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive versatility, effectiveness, and interpretability of MLLMs in various person ReID tasks. Nevertheless, they also have limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared data. We hope that VP-ReID can facilitate the community in developing more robust and generalizable cross-modal foundation models for person ReID.</p></details> |  | None |

Automated question answering systems over such codes enable quick and accurate access to specific regulatory clauses, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential for this task as they combine the precision of information retrieval with the generative capabilities of language models. However, tabular data are challenging to extract as they often involve complex layouts, merged cells, multi-row headers, and embedded semantic relationships that are not easily captured by traditional natural language processing techniques and Vision Language Models (VLMs). This paper explores and compares two methods for extracting information from tabular data in building codes using several pre-trained VLMs. First, a direct input method is used, where the image of the page is input directly into the VLMs, which are then tasked with answering questions based on the image. Second, an indirect input method is introduced, which involves converting an image of a page containing tables into the LaTeX code and then answering inquires based on the LaTeX-based input. The experiments find that the direct input method generally resulted in higher accuracy than the indirect input method. To further improve the performance, we fine-tuned each VLM using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a domain-specific tabular dataset. The fine-tuned models exhibited substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct achieving relative accuracy gains exceeding 100%. Our results highlight the potential of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to adapt powerful VLMs for understanding complex structured data in specialized fields, such as building code interpretation and regulatory compliance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, previous NeRF-based reconstruction methods overlook the critical role of acoustic impedance in ultrasound imaging. Localization methods face challenges related to local minima due to the selection of initial poses. In this study, we design a robotic ultrasound system (RUSS) with an acoustic-impedance-aware ultrasound NeRF (AIA-UltraNeRF) to decouple the scanning and diagnostic processes. Specifically, AIA-UltraNeRF models a continuous function of hash-encoded spatial coordinates for the 3D ultrasound map, allowing for the storage of acoustic impedance without dense sampling. This approach accelerates both reconstruction and inference speeds. We then propose a dual-supervised network that leverages teacher and student models to hash-encode the rendered ultrasound images from the reconstructed map. AIA-UltraNeRF retrieves the most similar hash values without the need to render images again, providing an offline initial image position for localization. Moreover, we develop a RUSS with a spherical remote center of motion mechanism to hold the probe, implementing operator-independent scanning modes that separate image acquisition from diagnostic workflows. Experimental results on a phantom and human subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of acoustic impedance in implicitly characterizing the color of ultrasound images. AIAUltraNeRF achieves both reconstruction and localization with inference speeds that are 9.9 faster than those of vanilla NeRF.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ARIAL: An Agentic Framework for Document VQA with Precise Answer Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18192v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods primarily focus on appearance-driven cross-modal retrieval, yet face significant challenges due to the visual complexity of scenes and the inherent ambiguity of textual descriptions. The contextual information, such as landmarks and relational cues, provides complementary cues that can offer valuable complementary insights for retrieval, but remains underexploited in current approaches. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a novel paradigm: scene-aware text-based person retrieval, which explicitly integrates both individual appearance and global scene context to improve retrieval accuracy. To support this, we first introduce ScenePerson-13W, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising over 100,000 real-world scenes with rich annotations encompassing both pedestrian attributes and scene context. Based on this dataset, we further present SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first stage, SA-Person performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual descriptions with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking module that refines retrieval results by jointly reasoning over pedestrian appearance and the global scene context. Extensive experiments on ScenePerson-13W and existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SA-Person. Both the dataset and code will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures. Under review</p></details> | None |

Existing methods mainly concentrate on the fusion of multi-modal features, yet neglecting the background interference. Besides, current multi-modal fusion methods often focus on aligning modality pairs but suffer from multi-modal consistency alignment. To address these issues, we propose a novel selective interaction and global-local alignment framework called Signal for multi-modal object ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Selective Interaction Module (SIM) to select important patch tokens with intra-modal and inter-modal information. These important patch tokens engage in the interaction with class tokens, thereby yielding more discriminative features. Then, we propose a Global Alignment Module (GAM) to simultaneously align multi-modal features by minimizing the volume of 3D polyhedra in the gramian space. Meanwhile, we propose a Local Alignment Module (LAM) to align local features in a shift-aware manner. With these modules, our proposed framework could extract more discriminative features for object ReID. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) validate the effectiveness of our method.

While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion.</p></details> |  | None |

It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 Oral, extended version</p></details> | None |

These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/be-chen/REMSA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/be-chen/REMSA) |

Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images, (ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.</p></details> | 7 figures | None |
| **[A Little More Like This: Text-to-Image Retrieval with Vision-Language Models Using Relevance Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17255v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable intuitive visual search using natural language queries. However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.</p></details> | Accepted to WACV'26 | None |
| **[Composed Object Retrieval: Object-level Retrieval via Composed Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04424v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research. We will publicly release both the dataset and the model at https://github.com/wangtong627/COR.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/wangtong627/COR) |

Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables; Accepted by WACV 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[VLM-Augmented Degradation Modeling for Image Restoration Under Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16998v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions, such as rain, haze, snow, or a mixture of them, is desirable yet challenging for autonomous driving and outdoor robots. In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DReX: Pure Vision Fusion of Self-Supervised and Convolutional Representations for Image Complexity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16991v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual complexity prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in image compression, retrieval, and classification. Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |
| **[Colo-ReID: Discriminative Representation Embedding with Meta-learning for Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00929v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras and plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. However, traditional methods for object ReID directly adopting CNN models trained on the ImageNet dataset usually produce unsatisfactory retrieval performance on colonoscopic datasets due to the large domain gap. Additionally, these methods neglect to explore the potential of self-discrepancy among intra-class or inter-class relations in the colonoscopic polyp dataset, which remains an open research problem in the medical community. To solve this dilemma, we propose a simple but effective training method named Colo-ReID, which can help our model learn more general and discriminative knowledge based on the meta-learning strategy in scenarios with fewer samples. Based on this, a dynamic Meta-Learning Regulation mechanism called MLR is introduced to further boost the performance of polyp re-identification. Our experimental results show that Colo-ReID consistently outperforms second-best method in terms of mAP performance by +2.3% on polyp re-identification task. Our source code is also publicly available at https://github.com/JeremyXSC/Colo-ReID.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/JeremyXSC/Colo-ReID) |
| **[Comparison of Text-Based and Image-Based Retrieval in Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Large Language Model Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16654v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |

Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

In this work, we present NutriScreener, a retrieval-augmented, multi-pose graph attention network that combines CLIP-based visual embeddings, class-boosted knowledge retrieval, and context awareness to enable robust malnutrition detection and anthropometric prediction from children's images, simultaneously addressing generalizability and class imbalance. In a clinical study, doctors rated it 4.3/5 for accuracy and 4.6/5 for efficiency, confirming its deployment readiness in low-resource settings. Trained and tested on 2,141 children from AnthroVision and additionally evaluated on diverse cross-continent populations, including ARAN and an in-house collected CampusPose dataset, it achieves 0.79 recall, 0.82 AUC, and significantly lower anthropometric RMSEs, demonstrating reliable measurement in unconstrained pediatric settings. Cross-dataset results show up to 25% recall gain and up to 3.5 cm RMSE reduction using demographically matched knowledge bases. NutriScreener offers a scalable and accurate solution for early malnutrition detection in low-resource environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 Special Track on AI for Social Impact</p></details> | None |

It introduces a new automated benchmark construction method for this evaluation. The experiment compared common LVLMs with human participants using a mixed dataset of AI and human-created images. Results showed that LVLMs could distinguish between the image types to some extent but exhibited a rightward bias, and perform significantly worse compared to humans. To build on these findings, we developed an automated benchmark construction process using AI. This process involved topic retrieval, narrative script generation, error embedding, and image generation, creating a diverse set of text-image pairs with intentional errors. We validated our method through constructing two caparable benchmarks. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LVLMs in real-world understanding and advances benchmark construction techniques, providing a scalable and automatic approach for AI model evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contrastive vision-language learning with paraphrasing and negation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16527v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.</p></details> |  | None |

Although PDF documents are prominent sources of knowledge, text-based RAG pipelines are ineffective at capturing their rich multi-modal information. In contrast, visual document RAG (VD-RAG) uses screenshots of document pages as the KB, which has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results. However, by introducing the image modality, VD-RAG introduces new attack vectors for adversaries to disrupt the system by injecting malicious documents into the KB. In this paper, we demonstrate the vulnerability of VD-RAG to poisoning attacks targeting both retrieval and generation. We define two attack objectives and demonstrate that both can be realized by injecting only a single adversarial image into the KB. Firstly, we introduce a targeted attack against one or a group of queries with the goal of spreading targeted disinformation. Secondly, we present a universal attack that, for any potential user query, influences the response to cause a denial-of-service in the VD-RAG system. We investigate the two attack objectives under both white-box and black-box assumptions, employing a multi-objective gradient-based optimization approach as well as prompting state-of-the-art generative models. Using two visual document datasets, a diverse set of state-of-the-art retrievers (embedding models) and generators (vision language models), we show VD-RAG is vulnerable to poisoning attacks in both the targeted and universal settings, yet demonstrating robustness to black-box attacks in the universal setting.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing CoVR benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving, and provides 180K triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving datasets. Previous CoVR benchmarks, focusing on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct each  pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics, we propose TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image, video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR, TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 27.22.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OWT: A Foundational Organ-Wise Tokenization Framework for Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04899v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in representation learning often rely on holistic embeddings that entangle multiple semantic components, limiting interpretability and generalization. These issues are especially critical in medical imaging, where downstream tasks depend on anatomically interpretable features. To address these limitations, we propose an Organ-Wise Tokenization (OWT) framework with a Token Group-based Reconstruction (TGR) training paradigm. Unlike conventional approaches, OWT explicitly disentangles an image into separable token groups, each corresponding to a distinct organ or semantic entity. Our design ensures each token group encapsulates organ-specific information, boosting interpretability, generalization, and efficiency while enabling fine-grained control for targeted clinical applications. Experiments on CT and MRI datasets demonstrate OWT's power: it not only achieves strong performance on standard tasks like image reconstruction and segmentation, but also unlocks novel, high-impact clinical capabilities including organ-specific tumor identification, organ-level retrieval and semantic-level generation, without requiring any additional training. These findings underscore the potential of OWT as a foundational framework for semantically disentangled representation learning, offering broad scalability and a new perspective on how representations can be leveraged.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Shape and Texture Recognition in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23062v4)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shapes and textures are the basic building blocks of visual perception. The ability to identify shapes regardless of orientation, texture, or context, and to recognize textures and materials independently of their associated objects, is essential for a general visual understanding of the world. This work introduces the Large Shape and Textures dataset (LAS&T), a giant collection of highly diverse shapes and textures, created by unsupervised extraction of patterns from natural images. This dataset is used to benchmark how effectively leading Large Vision-Language Models (VLM) recognize and represent shapes, textures, and materials in 2D and 3D scenes. For shape recognition, we test the models' ability to match images of identical shapes that differ in orientation, texture, color, or environment. Our results show that the shape recognition capabilities of the LVLMs remain significantly below human performance. VLMs rely predominantly on high-level and semantic features and struggle with abstract shapes lacking class associations. For texture and material recognition, we evaluated the models' ability to identify images with identical textures and materials across different objects and environments. Interestingly, leading LVLMs approach human-level performance in recognizing materials in 3D scenes, yet substantially underperform humans when identifying simpler, more abstract 2D textures and shapes. These results are consistent across a wide range of leading LVLMs (GPT/Gemini/Qwen) and foundation vision models (DINO/CLIP), exposing major deficiencies in the ability of leading models to extract and represent low-level visual features. In contrast, humans and simple nets trained directly for these tasks achieve high accuracy. The LAS&T dataset, featuring over 700,000 images for 2D/3D shape, texture, and material recognition and retrieval is freely available.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce a benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5) a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics, with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5 Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2026 International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC2026)</p></details> | None |

PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior.

The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Efforts to mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, an evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe surpasses all baselines by 22% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two datasets for culturally universal concepts, one comprising T2I-generated outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data.

In this work, we revisit the geolocalization task, which requires not only nuanced visual grounding but also web search to confirm or refine hypotheses during reasoning. Since existing geolocalization benchmarks fail to meet the need for high-resolution imagery and the localization challenge for deep agentic reasoning, we curate GeoBench, a benchmark that includes photos and panoramas from around the world, along with a subset of satellite images of different cities to rigorously evaluate the geolocalization ability of agentic models. We also propose GeoVista, an agentic model that seamlessly integrates tool invocation within the reasoning loop, including an image-zoom-in tool to magnify regions of interest and a web-search tool to retrieve related web information. We develop a complete training pipeline for it, including a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to learn reasoning patterns and tool-use priors, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to further enhance reasoning ability. We adopt a hierarchical reward to leverage multi-level geographical information and improve overall geolocalization performance. Experimental results show that GeoVista surpasses other open-source agentic models on the geolocalization task greatly and achieves performance comparable to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-5 on most metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15633v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually while preserving past knowledge. Recently, vision-language models like CLIP offer transferable features via multi-modal pre-training, making them well-suited for CIL. However, real-world visual and linguistic concepts are inherently hierarchical: a textual concept like "dog" subsumes fine-grained categories such as "Labrador" and "Golden Retriever," and each category entails its images. But existing CLIP-based CIL methods fail to explicitly capture this inherent hierarchy, leading to fine-grained class features drift during incremental updates and ultimately to catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose HASTEN (Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring) that anchors hierarchical information into CIL to reduce catastrophic forgetting. First, we employ an external knowledge graph as supervision to embed visual and textual features in hyperbolic space, effectively preserving hierarchical structure as data evolves. Second, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we project gradients onto the null space of the shared hyperbolic mapper, preventing interference with prior tasks. These two steps work synergistically to enable the model to resist forgetting by maintaining hierarchical relationships. Extensive experiments show that HASTEN consistently outperforms existing methods while providing a unified structured representation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HV-Attack: Hierarchical Visual Attack for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15435v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques have been widely applied to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but they also bring along novel safety issues. Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

As the relationship between a recipe and its cooked dish is cause-and-effect, treating a recipe as a text source describing the visual appearance of a dish for learning representation, as the existing approaches, will create bias misleading image-and-recipe similarity judgment. Specifically, a food image may not equally capture every detail in a recipe, due to factors such as the cooking process, dish presentation, and image-capturing conditions. The current representation learning tends to capture dominant visual-text alignment while overlooking subtle variations that determine retrieval relevance. In this paper, we model such bias in cross-modal representation learning using causal theory. The causal view of this problem suggests ingredients as one of the confounder sources and a simple backdoor adjustment can alleviate the bias. By causal intervention, we reformulate the conventional model for food-to-recipe retrieval with an additional term to remove the potential bias in similarity judgment. Based on this theory-informed formulation, we empirically prove the oracle performance of retrieval on the Recipe1M dataset to be MedR=1 across the testing data sizes of 1K, 10K, and even 50K. We also propose a plug-and-play neural module, which is essentially a multi-label ingredient classifier for debiasing. New state-of-the-art search performances are reported on the Recipe1M dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current remote sensing (RS)-specific CLIP variants still inherit this limited spatial awareness. We identify two key limitations behind this: (1) current RS image-text datasets generate global captions from object-level labels, leaving the original object-level supervision underutilized; (2) despite the success of region-text alignment methods in general domain, their direct application to RS data often leads to performance degradation. To address these, we construct the first multi-granularity RS image-text dataset, MGRS-200k, featuring rich object-level textual supervision for RS region-category alignment. We further investigate existing fine-grained CLIP tuning strategies and find that current explicit region-text alignment methods, whether in a direct or indirect way, underperform due to severe degradation of CLIP's semantic coherence. Building on these, we propose FarSLIP, a Fine-grained Aligned RS Language-Image Pretraining framework. Rather than the commonly used patch-to-CLS self-distillation, FarSLIP employs patch-to-patch distillation to align local and global visual cues, which improves feature discriminability while preserving semantic coherence. Additionally, to effectively utilize region-text supervision, it employs simple CLS token-based region-category alignment rather than explicit patch-level alignment, further enhancing spatial awareness. FarSLIP features improved fine-grained vision-language alignment in RS domain and sets a new state of the art not only on RS open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, but also on image-level tasks such as zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval.

For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2026. 11 pages, 9 figures</p></details> | None |

Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figures | None |

Various explanation methods have been proposed to visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend explanation evaluation metrics, such as the pointing game and area between the insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations. Experiments on the MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order methods, such as FIxLIP, outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in comparing different models, e.g. CLIP vs. SigLIP-2.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module. The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image. Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy. Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source.

Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage "retrieval-matching" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively).

However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.</p></details> |  | None |

Although both tasks share a common retrieval objective, they pose distinct challenges: I2I emphasizes discriminative identity learning, while T2I requires accurate cross-modal semantic alignment. Existing methods often treat these tasks separately, which may lead to representation entanglement and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a unified framework named Hierarchical Prompt Learning (HPL), which leverages task-aware prompt modeling to jointly optimize both tasks. Specifically, we first introduce a Task-Routed Transformer, which incorporates dual classification tokens into a shared visual encoder to route features for I2I and T2I branches respectively. On top of this, we develop a hierarchical prompt generation scheme that integrates identity-level learnable tokens with instance-level pseudo-text tokens. These pseudo-tokens are derived from image or text features via modality-specific inversion networks, injecting fine-grained, instance-specific semantics into the prompts. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal Prompt Regularization strategy to enforce semantic alignment in the prompt token space, ensuring that pseudo-prompts preserve source-modality characteristics while enhancing cross-modal transferability. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both I2I and T2I tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

We introduce Language-Guided Invariance Probing (LGIP), a benchmark that measures (i) invariance to meaning-preserving paraphrases and (ii) sensitivity to meaning-changing semantic flips in image-text matching. Using 40k MS COCO images with five human captions each, we automatically generate paraphrases and rule-based flips that alter object category, color or count, and summarize model behavior with an invariance error, a semantic sensitivity gap and a positive-rate statistic. Across nine VLMs, EVA02-CLIP and large OpenCLIP variants lie on a favorable invariance-sensitivity frontier, combining low paraphrase-induced variance with consistently higher scores for original captions than for their flipped counterparts. In contrast, SigLIP and SigLIP2 show much larger invariance error and often prefer flipped captions to the human descriptions, especially for object and color edits. These failures are largely invisible to standard retrieval metrics, indicating that LGIP provides a model-agnostic diagnostic for the linguistic robustness of VLMs beyond conventional accuracy scores.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike conventional deep learning approaches that rely on extensive training, annotated datasets, and powerful GPU resources, THIR operates entirely without supervision. It extracts topological fingerprints directly from RGB histopathological images using cubical persistence, encoding the evolution of loops as compact, interpretable feature vectors. The similarity retrieval is then performed by computing the distances between these topological descriptors, efficiently returning the top-K most relevant matches. Extensive experiments on the BreaKHis dataset demonstrate that THIR outperforms state of the art supervised and unsupervised methods.

To address this, we propose a lightweight and data-efficient framework for multilingual vision-language alignment. Our approach requires no image-text pairs or text-text pairs and freezes both the pretrained image encoder and multilingual text encoder during training. Only a compact 1.7M-parameter projection module is trained, using a contrastive loss over English representations as semantic anchors. This minimal training setup enables robust multilingual alignment even for languages with limited supervision.

In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack that explicitly leverages the geometric properties of hyperbolic space. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the loss function in the tangent space of hyperbolic space, decompose it into a radial (depth) component and an angular (semantic) component, and apply perturbation derived solely from the angular direction. Our method generates adversarial examples by focusing perturbations in semantically sensitive directions encoded in angular movement within the hyperbolic geometry. Empirical results on image classification, cross-modal retrieval tasks and network architectures demonstrate that our attack achieves higher fooling rates than conventional adversarial attacks, while producing high-impact perturbations with deeper insights into vulnerabilities of hyperbolic embeddings. This work highlights the importance of geometry-aware adversarial strategies in curved representation spaces and provides a principled framework for attacking hierarchical embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Not All Attention Heads Are What You Need: Refining CLIP's Image Representation with Attention Ablation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00537v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. Building on interpretability studies, we conduct an exhaustive analysis and find that certain heads, distributed across layers, are detrimental to the resulting representations. To mitigate their impact, we propose a simple yet effective Attention Ablation Technique (AAT) that suppresses selected heads by directly manipulating their attention weights. By incorporating two complementary strategies tailored to different application scenarios, AAT enables the systematic identification and ablation of harmful heads with minimal overhead. Experiments show that AAT consistently improves downstream performance across diverse domains, boosting recall by up to 11.1% on cross-modal retrieval benchmarks. These results highlight that AAT can effectively refine large-scale VLMs with virtually no extra inference cost, while yielding semantically meaningful patterns that align with existing interpretability findings.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures | None |

Recently, the emergence of the powerful visual foundation model, DINOv2, trained in a self-supervised manner on massive datasets, has significantly improved VPR performance. This improvement stems from DINOv2's exceptional feature generalization capabilities but is often accompanied by increased model complexity and computational overhead that impede deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, we propose $D^{2}$-VPR, a $D$istillation- and $D$eformable-based framework that retains the strong feature extraction capabilities of visual foundation models while significantly reducing model parameters and achieving a more favorable performance-efficiency trade-off. Specifically, first, we employ a two-stage training strategy that integrates knowledge distillation and fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a Distillation Recovery Module (DRM) to better align the feature spaces between the teacher and student models, thereby minimizing knowledge transfer losses to the greatest extent possible. Second, we design a Top-Down-attention-based Deformable Aggregator (TDDA) that leverages global semantic features to dynamically and adaptively adjust the Regions of Interest (ROI) used for aggregation, thereby improving adaptability to irregular structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, it reduces the parameter count by approximately 64.2% and FLOPs by about 62.6% (compared to CricaVPR).Code is available at https://github.com/tony19980810/D2VPR.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/tony19980810/D2VPR) |

In order to make this correspondence search tractable in large scenes, existing pipelines either rely on search heuristics, or perform image retrieval to reduce the search space by comparing the current image to a database of past observations. However, these approaches result in elaborate pipelines or storage requirements that grow with the number of past observations. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for making structure-based relocalisation tractable. Instead of relying on image retrieval or search heuristics, we learn a direct mapping from image observations to the visible scene structure in a compact neural network. Given a query image, a forward pass through our novel visible structure retrieval network allows obtaining the subset of 3D structure points in the map that the image views, thus reducing the search space of 2D-3D correspondences. We show that our proposed method enables performing localisation with an accuracy comparable to the state of the art, while requiring lower computational and storage footprint.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2025</p></details> | None |

Given a prompt like "retrieve (or generate) a street scene without pedestrians," they often fail to respect the "not." Existing methods address this limitation by fine-tuning on large negation datasets, but such retraining often compromises the model's zero-shot performance on affirmative prompts. We show that the embedding space of VLMs, such as CLIP, can be divided into semantically consistent subspaces. Based on this property, we propose a training-free framework that models negation as a subspace in the joint embedding space rather than a single point (Figure 1). To find the matching image for a caption such as "A but not N," we construct two spherical caps around the embeddings of A and N, and we score images by the central direction of the region that is close to A and far from N. Across retrieval, MCQ, and text-to-image tasks, our method improves negation understanding by about 30% on average over prior methods. It closes the gap between affirmative and negated prompts while preserving the zero-shot performance that fine-tuned models fail to maintain. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Disease-Aware Dual-Stage Framework for Chest X-ray Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12259v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology report generation from chest X-rays is an important task in artificial intelligence with the potential to greatly reduce radiologists' workload and shorten patient wait times. Despite recent advances, existing approaches often lack sufficient disease-awareness in visual representations and adequate vision-language alignment to meet the specialized requirements of medical image analysis. As a result, these models usually overlook critical pathological features on chest X-rays and struggle to generate clinically accurate reports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stage disease-aware framework for chest X-ray report generation. In Stage~1, our model learns Disease-Aware Semantic Tokens (DASTs) corresponding to specific pathology categories through cross-attention mechanisms and multi-label classification, while simultaneously aligning vision and language representations via contrastive learning. In Stage~2, we introduce a Disease-Visual Attention Fusion (DVAF) module to integrate disease-aware representations with visual features, along with a Dual-Modal Similarity Retrieval (DMSR) mechanism that combines visual and disease-specific similarities to retrieve relevant exemplars, providing contextual guidance during report generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., CheXpert Plus, IU X-ray, and MIMIC-CXR) demonstrate that our disease-aware framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in chest X-ray report generation, with significant improvements in clinical accuracy and linguistic quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

While fully supervised SGG has improved steadily, it suffers from training bias due to limited curated data and long-tail predicate distributions, leading to poor predicate diversity and degraded downstream performance. We present PRISM-0, a zero-shot open-vocabulary SGG framework that leverages foundation models in a bottom-up pipeline to capture a broad spectrum of predicates. Detected object pairs are filtered, described via a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and processed by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate fine- and coarse-grained predicates, which are then validated by a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. PRISM-0 modular, dataset-independent design enriches existing SGG datasets such as Visual Genome and produces diverse, unbiased graphs. While operating entirely in a zero-shot setting, PRISM-0 achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art weakly-supervised models on SGG benchmarks and even state-of-the-art supervised methods in tasks such as Sentence-to-Graph Retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Model Inversion Attack Against Deep Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12233v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep hashing improves retrieval efficiency through compact binary codes, yet it introduces severe and often overlooked privacy risks. The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing work has primarily focused on text-only scenario and largely overlooked the role of multimodality. We introduce MAVIS, the first benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal source attribution systems that understand user intent behind visual questions, retrieve multimodal evidence, and generate long-form answers with citations. Our dataset comprises 157K visual QA instances, where each answer is annotated with fact-level citations referring to multimodal documents. We develop fine-grained automatic metrics along three dimensions of informativeness, groundedness, and fluency, and demonstrate their strong correlation with human judgments. Our key findings are threefold: (1) LVLMs with multimodal RAG generate more informative and fluent answers than unimodal RAG, but they exhibit weaker groundedness for image documents than for text documents, a gap amplified in multimodal settings. (2) Given the same multimodal documents, there is a trade-off between informativeness and groundedness across different prompting methods. (3) Our proposed method highlights mitigating contextual bias in interpreting image documents as a crucial direction for future research.

| **[Implicit-Knowledge Visual Question Answering with Structured Reasoning Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06638v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. Recent work has introduced its implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model (MLLM) is the sole knowledge source and answers are produced without external retrieval. Existing IK-KVQA approaches, however, are typically trained with answer-only supervision: reasoning remains implicit, justifications are often weak or inconsistent, and generalization after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can be brittle. We propose MODELNAME, a framework that equips IK-KVQA with dual-path structured reasoning traces (symbolic relation paths over text and vision together with path-grounded natural-language explanations) to provide a stronger inductive bias than generic answer-only supervision. These traces act as modality-aware scaffolds that guide the model toward relevant entities and attributes, offering more structure than generic chain-of-thought supervision while not constraining reasoning to any single fixed path. Using a single open-source MLLM, MODELNAME constructs and selects traces to build an offline trace-enriched dataset and then performs structure-aware self-distillation; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases are used, and inference is a single autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, MODELNAME consistently improves both answer accuracy and the transparency of intermediate reasoning, achieving up to 11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over the strongest baseline.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RAC3: Retrieval-Augmented Corner Case Comprehension for Autonomous Driving with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11050v4)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, a cross-modal alignment training method for embedding models with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying and retrieval pipeline based on K-Means clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> | None |

Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5. Meanwhile, LAT not only outperforms the supervised fine-tuning baseline, which is trained to directly produce answers with attribution, but also exhibits stronger generalization across domains.</p></details> | Poster of AAAI'2026 | None |
| **[Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE) |

We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages,12 figures,published to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of "Pretraining, Post-training, and Application", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models. Over three years and five iterations, MOON has evolved along four critical dimensions: data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application. The lessons and insights gained through the iterative improvements will also be shared. As part of our exploration into scaling effects in the e-commerce field, we further conduct a systematic study of the scaling laws governing multimodal representation learning, examining multiple factors such as the number of training tokens, negative samples, and the length of user behavior sequences.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures | None |

While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to AAAI 2026 main track</p></details> | None |

This goes beyond conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements, and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/coret/</p></details> |  | None |

Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data.

Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.</p></details> | <details><summary>My co...</summary><p>My co-authors say some specific changes has to be made first</p></details> | None |

During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x.

The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.</p></details> | 2 figures, 11 pages | None |

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GEA: Generation-Enhanced Alignment for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10154v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment.

| **[Doubly Debiased Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11690v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time prompt tuning for vision-language models has demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities under zero-shot settings. However, tuning the learnable prompts solely based on unlabeled test data may induce prompt optimization bias, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we analyze the underlying causes of prompt optimization bias from both the model and data perspectives. In terms of the model, the entropy minimization objective typically focuses on reducing the entropy of model predictions while overlooking their correctness. This can result in overconfident yet incorrect outputs, thereby compromising the quality of prompt optimization. On the data side, prompts affected by optimization bias can introduce misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which further aggravates the prompt optimization bias. To this end, we propose a Doubly Debiased Test-Time Prompt Tuning method. Specifically, we first introduce a dynamic retrieval-augmented modulation module that retrieves high-confidence knowledge from a dynamic knowledge base using the test image feature as a query, and uses the retrieved knowledge to modulate the predictions. Guided by the refined predictions, we further develop a reliability-aware prompt optimization module that incorporates a confidence-based weighted ensemble and cross-modal consistency distillation to impose regularization constraints during prompt tuning. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmark datasets involving both natural distribution shifts and cross-datasets generalization demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, validating its effectiveness in mitigating prompt optimization bias.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 | None |
| **[From Street to Orbit: Training-Free Cross-View Retrieval via Location Semantics and LLM Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09820v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-view image retrieval, particularly street-to-satellite matching, is a critical task for applications such as autonomous navigation, urban planning, and localization in GPS-denied environments. However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

| **[NeuroCLIP: Brain-Inspired Prompt Tuning for EEG-to-Image Multimodal Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09250v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in brain-inspired artificial intelligence have sought to align neural signals with visual semantics using multimodal models such as CLIP. However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality-level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Negative Entity Suppression for Zero-Shot Captioning with Synthetic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08909v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

These representations must be built from potentially noisy partial observations. In this work, we focus on the problem of reconstructing a multi-object scene from a single RGBD image using a fixed camera. Traditional scene representation methods generally cannot infer the geometry of unobserved regions of the objects in the image. Attempts have been made to leverage deep learning to train on a dataset of known objects and representations, and then generalize to new observations. However, this can be brittle to noisy real-world observations and objects not contained in the dataset, and do not provide well-calibrated reconstruction confidences. We propose BRRP, a reconstruction method that leverages preexisting mesh datasets to build an informative prior during robust probabilistic reconstruction. We introduce the concept of a retrieval-augmented prior, where we retrieve relevant components of our prior distribution from a database of objects during inference. The resulting prior enables estimation of the geometry of occluded portions of the in-scene objects. Our method produces a distribution over object shape that can be used for reconstruction and measuring uncertainty. We evaluate our method in both simulated scenes and in the real world. We demonstrate the robustness of our method against deep learning-only approaches while being more accurate than a method without an informative prior. Through real-world experiments, we particularly highlight the capability of BRRP to enable successful dexterous manipulation in clutter.</p></details> |  | None |

Descriptions can be especially unique across languages and cultures. Modern vision-language models (VLMs) gain understanding of images with text in different languages often through training on machine translations of English captions. However, this process relies on input content written from the perception of English speakers, leading to a perceptual bias. In this work, we outline a framework to address this bias. We specifically use a small amount of native speaker data, nearest-neighbor example guidance, and multimodal LLM reasoning to augment captions to better reflect descriptions in a target language. When adding the resulting rewrites to multilingual CLIP finetuning, we improve on German and Japanese text-image retrieval case studies (up to +3.5 mean recall, +4.4 on native vs. translation errors). We also propose a mechanism to build understanding of object description variation across languages, and offer insights into cross-dataset and cross-language generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNLP-AACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> | None |

Unlike traditional Text-based Person Retrieval (T-PR), which focuses solely on ground-view images, TAG-PR introduces greater practical significance and presents unique challenges due to the large viewpoint discrepancy across images. To support this task, we contribute: (1) TAG-PEDES dataset, constructed from public benchmarks with automatically generated textual descriptions, enhanced by a diversified text generation paradigm to ensure robustness under view heterogeneity; and (2) TAG-CLIP, a novel retrieval framework that addresses view heterogeneity through a hierarchically-routed mixture of experts module to learn view-specific and view-agnostic features and a viewpoint decoupling strategy to decouple view-specific features for better cross-modal alignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAG-CLIP on both the proposed TAG-PEDES dataset and existing T-PR benchmarks.

We propose Targeted Manifold Manipulation-Nearest Neighbour (TMM-NN), which reconceptualises retrieval by assessing how readily each sample can be nudged into a designated region of the feature manifold; neighbourhoods are defined by a sample's responsiveness to a targeted perturbation rather than absolute geometric distance. TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected. By ranking candidates by this confidence, TMM-NN retrieves the most semantically related neighbours. Robustness analysis and benchmark experiments confirm this trigger-based ranking outperforms traditional metrics under noise and across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Diffusion model, phase retrieval, inline-holography, inverse problem</p></details> | None |

However, existing approaches primarily focus on direct brain-image feature alignment and are limited to single-task frameworks or task-specific models. In this paper, we propose a Unified MultItask Network for zero-shot M/EEG visual Decoding (referred to UMind), including visual stimulus retrieval, classification, and reconstruction, where multiple tasks mutually enhance each other. Our method learns robust neural-visual and semantic representations through multimodal alignment with both image and text modalities. The integration of both coarse and fine-grained texts enhances the extraction of these neural representations, enabling more detailed semantic and visual decoding. These representations then serve as dual conditional inputs to a pre-trained diffusion model, guiding visual reconstruction from both visual and semantic perspectives. Extensive evaluations on MEG and EEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and biological plausibility of our approach in capturing spatiotemporal neural dynamics. Our approach sets a multitask pipeline for brain visual decoding, highlighting the synergy of semantic information in visual feature extraction.

| **[Visual Bridge: Universal Visual Perception Representations Generating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07877v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in isolated computer vision tasks such as text-to-image generation, depth estimation, and optical flow. However, these models are often restricted by a ``single-task-single-model'' paradigm, severely limiting their generalizability and scalability in multi-task scenarios. Motivated by the cross-domain generalization ability of large language models, we propose a universal visual perception framework based on flow matching that can generate diverse visual representations across multiple tasks. Our approach formulates the process as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations rather than an independent generation or regression problem. By leveraging a strong self-supervised foundation model as the anchor and introducing a multi-scale, circular task embedding mechanism, our method learns a universal velocity field to bridge the gap between heterogeneous tasks, supporting efficient and flexible representation transfer. Extensive experiments on classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models. Ablation studies further validate the robustness, scalability, and generalization of our framework. Our work marks a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception, providing a solid foundation for future research in universal vision modeling.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 | None |
| **[Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing for Noisy Multi-Label Cross-Modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07780v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal hashing (CMH) facilitates efficient retrieval across different modalities (e.g., image and text) by encoding data into compact binary representations. While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities. Extensive experiments on four widely-used cross-modal retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under noisy multi-label conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Fine-grained Image Retrieval via Dual-Vision Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16273v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model. However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training. Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 | None |

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed framework for neural visual decoding.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

However, they often fail to meet users' actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments, comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs, these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions.

However, in GNSS-denied environments, localization schemes that rely solely on satellite signals are prone to failure. Cross-view image retrieval-based localization is a promising alternative, yet substantial geometric and appearance domain gaps exist between oblique UAV views and nadir satellite orthophotos. Moreover, conventional approaches often depend on complex network architectures, text prompts, or large amounts of annotation, which hinders generalization. To address these issues, we propose DiffusionUavLoc, a cross-view localization framework that is image-prompted, text-free, diffusion-centric, and employs a VAE for unified representation. We first use training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images from UAV imagery as structural prompts. We then design a text-free conditional diffusion model that fuses multimodal structural cues to learn features robust to viewpoint changes.

In many real-world applications, consistent high performance on a limited set of tasks is more important than broad generalization. We propose ExpReS-VLA, a method for specializing pre-trained VLA models through experience replay and retrieval while preventing catastrophic forgetting. ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning. Adaptation takes 31 seconds using 12 demonstrations on a single RTX 5090 GPU, making the approach practical for real robot deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026.

| **[DeepAndes: A Self-Supervised Vision Foundation Model for Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing Imagery of the Andes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20303v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By mapping sites at large scales using remotely sensed data, archaeologists can generate unique insights into long-term demographic trends, inter-regional social networks, and past adaptations to climate change. Remote sensing surveys complement field-based approaches, and their reach can be especially great when combined with deep learning and computer vision techniques. However, conventional supervised deep learning methods face challenges in annotating fine-grained archaeological features at scale. While recent vision foundation models have shown remarkable success in learning large-scale remote sensing data with minimal annotations, most off-the-shelf solutions are designed for RGB images rather than multi-spectral satellite imagery, such as the 8-band data used in our study. In this paper, we introduce DeepAndes, a transformer-based vision foundation model trained on three million multi-spectral satellite images, specifically tailored for Andean archaeology. DeepAndes incorporates a customized DINOv2 self-supervised learning algorithm optimized for 8-band multi-spectral imagery, marking the first foundation model designed explicitly for the Andes region. We evaluate its image understanding performance through imbalanced image classification, image instance retrieval, and pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments show that DeepAndes achieves superior F1 scores, mean average precision, and Dice scores in few-shot learning scenarios, significantly outperforming models trained from scratch or pre-trained on smaller datasets. This underscores the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised pre-training in archaeological remote sensing.

| **[Hybrid CNN-ViT Framework for Motion-Blurred Scene Text Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06087v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion blur in scene text images severely impairs readability and hinders the reliability of computer vision tasks, including autonomous driving, document digitization, and visual information retrieval. Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the CNN-ViT hybrid design, establishing its practicality for real-world motion-blurred scene-text restoration.</p></details> |  | None |

Current LLM-based approaches face limitations: image-text matching struggles with complex hazards, while instruction tuning lacks generalization and is resource-intensive. Our method dynamically integrates external knowledge and retrieved similar cases via prompt tuning, overcoming LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge and feature correlation. The framework comprises a case database, an image retrieval module, and an LLM-based reasoning module. Evaluated on real-site data, our approach boosted GLM-4V's accuracy to 50%, a 35.49% improvement over baselines, with consistent gains across hazard types. Ablation studies validated the effectiveness of our image retrieval strategy, showing the superiority of our LPIPS- and CLIP-based method. The proposed technique significantly improves identification accuracy and contextual understanding, demonstrating strong generalization and offering a practical path for intelligent safety risk detection in construction.</p></details> | in Chinese language | None |
| **[Towards Implicit Aggregation: Robust Image Representation for Place Recognition in the Transformer Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06024v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) is typically regarded as a specific image retrieval task, whose core lies in representing images as global descriptors. Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

However, drastic appearance variations of images at the same place caused by viewpoint changes can lead to inconsistent supervision signals, thereby degrading descriptor learning. Existing methods either rely on manually defined cropping rules or labeled data for view differentiation, but they suffer from two major limitations: (1) reliance on labels or handcrafted rules restricts generalization capability; (2) even within the same view direction, occlusions can introduce feature ambiguity. To address these issues, we propose MutualVPR, a mutual learning framework that integrates unsupervised view self-classification and descriptor learning. We first group images by geographic coordinates, then iteratively refine the clusters using K-means to dynamically assign place categories without orientation labels. Specifically, we adopt a DINOv2-based encoder to initialize the clustering. During training, the encoder and clustering co-evolve, progressively separating drastic appearance variations of the same place and enabling consistent supervision. Furthermore, we find that capturing fine-grained image differences at a place enhances robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MutualVPR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, validating the effectiveness of our framework in improving view direction generalization, occlusion robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred interest in automating echocardiographic interpretation. However, most existing medical VLMs rely on single-frame (image) inputs, which can reduce diagnostic accuracy for conditions identifiable only through cardiac motion. In addition, echocardiographic videos are captured from multiple views, each varying in suitability for detecting specific conditions. Leveraging multiple views may therefore improve diagnostic performance. We developed a video-language model that processes full video sequences from five standard views, trained on 60,747 echocardiographic video-report pairs. We evaluated the gains in retrieval performance from video input and multi-view support, including the contributions of various pretrained models.

To address this, we propose a unified framework for Open-World 3D Scene Graph Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning, which enables generalizable and interactive 3D scene understanding. Our method integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with retrieval-based reasoning to support multimodal exploration and language-guided interaction. The framework comprises two key components: (1) a dynamic scene graph generation module that detects objects and infers semantic relationships without fixed label sets, and (2) a retrieval-augmented reasoning pipeline that encodes scene graphs into a vector database to support text/image-conditioned queries. We evaluate our method on 3DSSG and Replica benchmarks across four tasks-scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning-demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in diverse environments. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining open-vocabulary perception with retrieval-based reasoning for scalable 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, such modals trained on a contrastive alignment can lack stability towards small input perturbations. Especially when dealing with manually expressed queries, minor variations in the query can cause large differences in the ranking of the best-matching results. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial surface edits such as punctuation and case. Our results highlight robustness as a critical dimension for evaluating vision-language models beyond benchmark accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MMM'26.

However, vision-language models such as CLIP are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content (e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG) methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial improvements when using detailed image descriptions. MMDocRAG establishes a rigorous testing ground and provides actionable insights for developing more robust multimodal DocVQA systems.

To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then, additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank. The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages, 3figures, published to ACM Digital Library</p></details> | None |

However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.</p></details> |  | None |

In our optical system, we translate the EVS along the optical axis, where the EVS records the intensity changes induced by defocus as events. To recover phase distributions, we formulate a partial differential equation, referred to as the transport of event equation, which presents a linear relationship between the defocus events and the phase distribution. We demonstrate through experiments that the EVS is more advantageous than the conventional image sensor for rapidly and stably detecting the intensity information, defocus events, which enables accurate phase retrieval, particularly under low-lighting conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DAFM: Dynamic Adaptive Fusion for Multi-Model Collaboration in Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05020v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a cross-modal task that aims to retrieve target images from large-scale databases using a reference image and a modification text. Most existing methods rely on a single model to perform feature fusion and similarity matching. However, this paradigm faces two major challenges. First, one model alone can't see the whole picture and the tiny details at the same time; it has to handle different tasks with the same weights, so it often misses the small but important links between image and text. Second, the absence of dynamic weight allocation prevents adaptive leveraging of complementary model strengths, so the resulting embedding drifts away from the target and misleads the nearest-neighbor search in CIR. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for multi-model collaboration in CIR. Rather than optimizing a single method in isolation, DAFM exploits the complementary strengths of heterogeneous models and adaptively rebalances their contributions. This not only maximizes retrieval accuracy but also ensures that the performance gains are independent of the fusion order, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Experiments on the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Our method achieves a Recall@10 of 93.21 and an Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and an average Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing recent strong baselines by up to 4.5%. These results confirm that dynamic multi-model collaboration provides an effective and general solution for CIR.</p></details> | 10 pages,4 figures | None |

The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method: Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In clinical workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2% performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence conditions in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted on behalf of the PREDICTOM consortium</p></details> | None |

Unlike traditional search engines that present results in ranked lists, GSEs shift users' attention from sequential browsing to content-driven subjective perception, driving a paradigm shift in information retrieval. In this context, enhancing the subjective visibility of content through Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO) methods has emerged as a new research focus. With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques, GSEs can now efficiently integrate text, images, audio, and video, producing richer responses that better satisfy complex information needs. Existing G-SEO methods, however, remain limited to text-based optimization and fail to fully exploit multimodal data. To address this gap, we propose Caption Injection, the first multimodal G-SEO approach, which extracts captions from images and injects them into textual content, integrating visual semantics to enhance the subjective visibility of content in generative search scenarios. We systematically evaluate Caption Injection on MRAMG, a benchmark for MRAG, under both unimodal and multimodal settings. Experimental results show that Caption Injection significantly outperforms text-only G-SEO baselines under the G-Eval metric, demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of multimodal integration in G-SEO to improve user-perceived content visibility.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by this, in this paper we explore the potential to learn time awareness from static images, trying to answer: *what time tells us?* To this end, we first introduce a Time-Oriented Collection (TOC) dataset, which contains 130,906 images with reliable timestamps. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a Time-Image Contrastive Learning (TICL) approach to jointly model timestamps and related visual representations through cross-modal contrastive learning. We found that the proposed TICL, 1) not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the timestamp estimation task, over various benchmark metrics, 2) but also, interestingly, though only seeing static images, the time-aware embeddings learned from TICL show strong capability in several time-aware downstream tasks such as time-based image retrieval, video scene classification, and time-aware image editing.

Experts then evaluate the answers of these systems against a rubric that assesses balanced perspectives, factual comprehensiveness, succinctness, and evidentiary support. Among the six systems two using RAG on curated literature outperformed existing closed models across key metrics, particularly in providing comprehensive and well-supported answers. We discuss promising aspects of LLM performances as well as critical short-comings of all the models.

Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational supervision for cross-modal alignment.</p></details> | Capstone Paper | None |
| **[FitPro: A Zero-Shot Framework for Interactive Text-based Pedestrian Retrieval in Open World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16674v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based Pedestrian Retrieval (TPR) deals with retrieving specific target pedestrians in visual scenes according to natural language descriptions. Although existing methods have achieved progress under constrained settings, interactive retrieval in the open-world scenario still suffers from limited model generalization and insufficient semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose FitPro, an open-world interactive zero-shot TPR framework with enhanced semantic comprehension and cross-scene adaptability. FitPro has three innovative components: Feature Contrastive Decoding (FCD), Incremental Semantic Mining (ISM), and Query-aware Hierarchical Retrieval (QHR). The FCD integrates prompt-guided contrastive decoding to generate high-quality structured pedestrian descriptions from denoised images, effectively alleviating semantic drift in zero-shot scenarios. The ISM constructs holistic pedestrian representations from multi-view observations to achieve global semantic modeling in multi-turn interactions, thereby improving robustness against viewpoint shifts and fine-grained variations in descriptions. The QHR dynamically optimizes the retrieval pipeline according to query types, enabling efficient adaptation to multi-modal and multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments on five public datasets and two evaluation protocols demonstrate that FitPro significantly overcomes the generalization limitations and semantic modeling constraints of existing methods in interactive retrieval, paving the way for practical deployment.</p></details> | 12pages,6 figures | None |
| **[Object Detection as an Optional Basis: A Graph Matching Network for Cross-View UAV Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02489v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas, satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations, or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps, such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Submitted to IEEE TIM</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git) |

However, as modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error. Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94), graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Class Agnostic Instance-level Descriptor for Visual Instance Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16745v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of effective instance-level feature representation. Supervised or weakly supervised object detection methods are not the appropriate solutions due to their poor performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance-level region discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of instance regions. On the one hand, this kind of hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and occlusions, which are widely observed in real scenarios. On the other hand, the non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the instance regions in different granularities within an image. Therefore, features in uniform length are produced for these instance regions, which may cover across a dominant image region, an integral of multiple instances, or various individual instances. Such a collection of features allows us to unify the image retrieval, multi-instance search, and instance search into one framework. The empirical studies on three benchmarks show that such an instance-level descriptor remains effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Moreover, the superior performance is achieved on single-instance and multi-instance search, as well as image retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Commercially available direct leaf sensors are bulky, powered electronics that are expensive and interfere with crop growth. In contrast, low-cost, passive and bio-degradable leaf sensors offer an opportunity to advance real-time monitoring as they directly interface with the crop surface while not interfering with crop growth. To this end, we co-design a sensor-detector system, where the sensor is a passive colorimetric leaf sensor that directly measures crop health in a precision agriculture setting, and the detector autonomously obtains optical signals from these leaf sensors. The detector comprises a low size weight and power (SWaP) mobile ground robot with an onboard monocular RGB camera and object detector to localize each leaf sensor, as well as a hyperspectral camera with a motorized mirror and halogen light to acquire hyperspectral images. The sensor's crop health-dependent optical signals can be extracted from the hyperspectral images. The proof-of-concept system is demonstrated in row-crop environments both indoors and outdoors where it is able to autonomously navigate, locate and obtain a hyperspectral image of all leaf sensors present, and acquire interpretable spectral resonance with 80 $\%$ accuracy within a required retrieval distance from the sensor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version.

While typical fusion techniques are training-free, they rely solely on rank or score signals, disregarding candidates' representations. This work introduces Vote-in-Context (ViC), a generalized, training-free framework that re-thinks list-wise reranking and fusion as a zero-shot reasoning task for a Vision-Language Model (VLM). The core insight is to serialize both content evidence and retriever metadata directly within the VLM's prompt, allowing the model to adaptively weigh retriever consensus against visual-linguistic content. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by applying it to the challenging domain of cross-modal video retrieval. To this end, we introduce the S-Grid, a compact serialization map that represents each video as an image grid, optionally paired with subtitles to enable list-wise reasoning over video candidates. ViC is evaluated both as a single-list reranker, where it dramatically improves the precision of individual retrievers, and as an ensemble fuser, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines like CombSUM. Across video retrieval benchmarks including ActivityNet and VATEX, the framework establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex visual and temporal signals alongside text. In zero-shot settings, ViC achieves Recall@1 scores of 87.1% (t2v) / 89.0% (v2t) on MSR-VTT and 99.6% (v2t) on VATEX, representing massive gains of up to +40 Recall@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines. We present ViC as a simple, reproducible, and highly effective recipe for turning modern VLMs into powerful zero-shot rerankers and fusers.

| **[Wave-Particle (Continuous-Discrete) Dualistic Visual Tokenization for Unified Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01593v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unification of understanding and generation within a single multi-modal large model (MLLM) remains one significant challenge, largely due to the dichotomy between continuous and discrete visual tokenizations. Continuous tokenizer (CT) achieves strong performance by bridging multiple independently-trained understanding modules and generation modules, but suffers from complex multi-stage pipelines and substantial engineering overhead. Conversely, discrete tokenizers (DT) offer a conceptually elegant idea by quantizing each image into a primitive, but inevitably leading to information loss and performance degradation. To resolve this tension, we question the binary choice between CT and DT, inspired by the wave-particle duality of light, and propose the Continuous-Discrete Dualistic Visual Tokenizer (CDD-VT). We treat visual data as a flexible composition of image primitives derived from quantized codebooks, with the crucial insight that the primitive number assigned to each visual sample is adaptively determined according to its complexity: simple instances use a few primitives, emulating discrete tokenization, while complex instances use many, approximating continuous tokenization. Two core components are designed: Diverse Quantitative Primitives, which encourage primitives orthogonality to better populate information space, and Dynamic Primitive Allocator, which assesses sample complexity to determine the optimal set of primitives. Extensive experiments on reconstruction, retrieval and classification show that CDD-VT achieves superior performance over to specialized CT and DT, effectively getting strong result within a concise and scalable MLLM.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VidText: Towards Comprehensive Evaluation for Video Text Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22810v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual texts embedded in videos carry rich semantic information, which is crucial for both holistic video understanding and fine-grained reasoning about local human actions. However, existing video understanding benchmarks largely overlook textual information, while OCR-specific benchmarks are constrained to static images, limiting their ability to capture the interaction between text and dynamic visual contexts. To address this gap, we propose VidText, a new benchmark designed for comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of video text understanding. VidText offers the following key features: 1) It covers a wide range of real-world scenarios and supports multilingual content, encompassing diverse settings where video text naturally appears. 2) It introduces a hierarchical evaluation framework with video-level, clip-level, and instance-level tasks, enabling assessment of both global summarization and local retrieval capabilities. 3) The benchmark also introduces a set of paired perception reasoning tasks, ranging from visual text perception to cross-modal reasoning between textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on 18 state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) reveal that current models struggle across most tasks, with significant room for improvement. Further analysis highlights the impact of both model-intrinsic factors, such as input resolution and OCR capability, and external factors, including the use of auxiliary information and Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies. We hope VidText will fill the current gap in video understanding benchmarks and serve as a foundation for future research on multimodal reasoning with video text in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

SAM-based interactive segmentation has gained attention for its strong generalization, but most methods follow a single-point-to-single-object paradigm, which limits multi-lesion segmentation. Moreover, ViT backbones capture global context but often miss high-fidelity local details. We propose MIQ-SAM3D, a multi-instance 3D segmentation framework with a competitive query optimization strategy that shifts from single-point-to-single-mask to single-point-to-multi-instance. A prompt-conditioned instance-query generator transforms a single point prompt into multiple specialized queries, enabling retrieval of all semantically similar lesions across the 3D volume from a single exemplar. A hybrid CNN-Transformer encoder injects CNN-derived boundary saliency into ViT self-attention via spatial gating. A competitively optimized query decoder then enables end-to-end, parallel, multi-instance prediction through inter-query competition. On LiTS17 and KiTS21 dataset, MIQ-SAM3D achieved comparable levels and exhibits strong robustness to prompts, providing a practical solution for efficient annotation of clinically relevant multi-lesion cases.</p></details> |  | None |

In this setting, the model responds to a text query by generating an identifier corresponding to the target image. However, existing methods typically rely on manually crafted string IDs, clustering-based labels, or atomic identifiers requiring vocabulary expansion, all of which face challenges in semantic alignment or scalability.To address these limitations, we propose a vocabulary-efficient identifier generation framework that prompts MLLMs to generate Structured Semantic Identifiers from image-caption pairs. These identifiers are composed of concept-level tokens such as objects and actions, naturally aligning with the model's generation space without modifying the tokenizer. Additionally, we introduce a Rationale-Guided Supervision Strategy, prompting the model to produce a one-sentence explanation alongside each identifier serves as an auxiliary supervision signal that improves semantic grounding and reduces hallucinations during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pl...</summary><p>We plan to revise the methodology and update the experimental analysis before resubmission</p></details> | None |

Current approaches face challenges in addressing patch redundancy and ambiguity, which arise from the inherent information density disparities across modalities. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as promising solutions to bridge this gap through their robust semantic generation capabilities. However, the dense textual outputs from MLLMs may introduce conflicts with the original sparse captions. Furthermore, accurately quantifying semantic relevance between rich visual patches and concise textual descriptions remains a core challenge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Semantic-Enhanced Patch Slimming (SEPS) framework, which systematically addresses patch redundancy and ambiguity. Our approach employs a two-stage mechanism to integrate unified semantics from both dense and sparse texts, enabling the identification of salient visual patches. Additionally, it leverages relevance-aware selection with mean value computation to highlight crucial patch-word correspondences, thereby improving cross-modal similarity assessment. Comprehensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets validate that SEPS achieves superior performance, surpassing existing approaches by 23\%-86\% in rSum across diverse model architectures, with notable enhancements in text-to-image retrieval scenarios.

| **[Efficient Test-Time Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01059v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities, their reliance on parametric knowledge often leads to inaccuracies. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, but these methods may introduce irrelevant retrieved documents, leading to inaccurate responses. While the integration methods filter out incorrect answers from multiple responses, but lack external knowledge like RAG methods, and their high costs require balancing overhead with performance gains. To address these issues, we propose an Efficient Test-Time Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework named ET2RAG to improve the performance of LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, ET2RAG is a training-free method, that first retrieves the most relevant documents and augments the LLMs to efficiently generate diverse candidate responses by managing response length. Then we compute the similarity of candidate responses and employ a majority voting mechanism to select the most suitable response as the final output. In particular, we discover that partial generation is sufficient to capture the key information necessary for consensus calculation, allowing us to effectively perform majority voting without the need for fully generated responses. Thus, we can reach a balance between computational cost and performance by managing the response length for the number of retrieved documents for majority voting. Experimental results demonstrate that ET2RAG significantly enhances performance across three tasks, including open-domain question answering, recipe generation and image captioning.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional retrieval methods are constrained by database coverage and quality. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enable direct location reasoning from image content, yet individual models struggle with diverse geographic regions and complex scenes. Existing multi-agent systems improve performance through model collaboration but treat all agent interactions uniformly. They lack mechanisms to handle conflicting predictions effectively. We propose \textbf{GraphGeo}, a multi-agent debate framework using heterogeneous graph neural networks for visual geo-localization. Our approach models diverse debate relationships through typed edges, distinguishing supportive collaboration, competitive argumentation, and knowledge transfer. We introduce a dual-level debate mechanism combining node-level refinement and edge-level argumentation modeling. A cross-level topology refinement strategy enables co-evolution between graph structure and agent representations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate GraphGeo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our framework transforms cognitive conflicts between agents into enhanced geo-localization accuracy through structured debate.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite progress made in this field, previous works suffer from using imbalanced samples of modalities and inconsistent low-quality information during training, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an approach called Dynamic Multi-level Weighted Alignment Network for ZS-SBIR. It consists of three components: (i) a Uni-modal Feature Extraction Module that includes a CLIP text encoder and a ViT for extracting textual and visual tokens, (ii) a Cross-modal Multi-level Weighting Module that produces an alignment weight list by the local and global aggregation blocks to measure the aligning quality of sketch and image samples, (iii) a Weighted Quadruplet Loss Module aiming to improve the balance of domains in the triplet loss. Experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Sketchy, TU-Berlin, and QuickDraw, show our method delivers superior performances over the state-of-the-art ZS-SBIR methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent methods combine class-agnostic segmenters (e.g., SAM) with patch-based image encoders (e.g., DINO) to produce compact and effective region representations, but they suffer from high computational cost due to the segmentation step. REN bypasses this bottleneck using a lightweight module that directly generates region tokens, enabling 60x faster token generation with 35x less memory, while also improving token quality. It uses a few cross-attention blocks that take point prompts as queries and features from a patch-based image encoder as keys and values to produce region tokens that correspond to the prompted objects. We train REN with three popular encoders-DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP-and show that it can be extended to other encoders without dedicated training. We evaluate REN on semantic segmentation and retrieval tasks, where it consistently outperforms the original encoders in both performance and compactness, and matches or exceeds SAM-based region methods while being significantly faster. Notably, REN achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging Ego4D VQ2D benchmark and outperforms proprietary LMMs on Visual Haystacks' single-needle challenge.

Specifically, the query image undergoes feature extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation. In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric, generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while simplifying the serving pathway.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some of the online experimental results in the paper are significantly different from the actual results, and need to be re-experimented and revised before submission.

Yet, its reliance on uncurated Internet-sourced data exposes it to data poisoning and backdoor risks. While existing studies primarily investigate image-based attacks, the text modality, which is equally central to CLIP's training, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce ToxicTextCLIP, a framework for generating high-quality adversarial texts that target CLIP during the pre-training phase. The framework addresses two key challenges: semantic misalignment caused by background inconsistency with the target class, and the scarcity of background-consistent texts. To this end, ToxicTextCLIP iteratively applies: 1) a background-aware selector that prioritizes texts with background content aligned to the target class, and 2) a background-driven augmenter that generates semantically coherent and diverse poisoned samples. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks show that ToxicTextCLIP achieves up to 95.83% poisoning success and 98.68% backdoor Hit@1, while bypassing RoCLIP, CleanCLIP and SafeCLIP defenses.

Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward personalized AI assistants.

State-of-the-art methods employ either grid-based classification or gallery-based image-location retrieval, whose spatial generalizability significantly suffers if the spatial distribution of test images does not align with the choices of grids and galleries. Recently emerging generative approaches, while getting rid of grids and galleries, use raw geographical coordinates and suffer quality losses due to their lack of multi-scale information. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-scale latent diffusion model called LocDiff for image geolocalization. We developed a novel positional encoding-decoding framework called Spherical Harmonics Dirac Delta (SHDD) Representations, which encodes points on a spherical surface (e.g., geolocations on Earth) into a Hilbert space of Spherical Harmonics coefficients and decodes points (geolocations) by mode-seeking on spherical probability distributions. We also propose a novel SirenNet-based architecture (CS-UNet) to learn an image-based conditional backward process in the latent SHDD space by minimizing a latent KL-divergence loss. To the best of our knowledge, LocDiff is the first image geolocalization model that performs latent diffusion in a multi-scale location encoding space and generates geolocations under the guidance of images. Experimental results show that LocDiff can outperform all state-of-the-art grid-based, retrieval-based, and diffusion-based baselines across 5 challenging global-scale image geolocalization datasets, and demonstrates significantly stronger generalizability to unseen geolocations.</p></details> |  | None |

A key approach to tackle this challenging task is Coulomb explosion imaging, which benefited decisively from recently emerging high-repetition-rate X-ray free-electron laser sources. With this technique, information on the molecular structure is inferred from the momentum distributions of the ions produced by the rapid Coulomb explosion of molecules. Retrieving molecular structures from these distributions poses a highly non-linear inverse problem that remains unsolved for molecules consisting of more than a few atoms. Here, we address this challenge using a diffusion-based Transformer neural network. We show that the network reconstructs unknown molecular geometries from ion-momentum distributions with a mean absolute error below one Bohr radius, which is half the length of a typical chemical bond.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images, offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements. Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch. Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities. We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks.

Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments. We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

In these scenarios, users often prefer diverse result sets to minimize redundancy and enhance information value. However, existing greedy-based diverse methods frequently yield sub-optimal results, failing to adequately approximate the optimal similarity score under certain diversification level. Furthermore, there is a need for flexible algorithms that can adapt to varying user-defined result sizes and diversity requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that seamlessly integrates result diversification into state-of-the-art (SOTA) A$k$-NNS methods. Our approach introduces a progressive search framework, consisting of iterative searching, diversification, and verification phases. Carefully designed diversification and verification steps enable our approach to efficiently approximate the optimal diverse result set according to user-specified diversification levels without additional indexing overhead. We evaluate our method on three million-scale benchmark datasets, LAION-art, Deep1M, and Txt2img, using latency, similarity, and recall as performance metrics across a range of $k$ values and diversification thresholds. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently retrieves near-optimal diverse results with minimal latency overhead, particularly under medium and high diversity settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ScoreAdv: Score-based Targeted Generation of Natural Adversarial Examples via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06078v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality, while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LATex: Leveraging Attribute-based Text Knowledge for Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23722v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important task in intelligent transportation systems, Aerial-Ground person Re-IDentification (AG-ReID) aims to retrieve specific persons across heterogeneous cameras in different viewpoints. Previous methods typically adopt deep learning-based models, focusing on extracting view-invariant features. However, they usually overlook the semantic information in person attributes. In addition, existing training strategies often rely on full fine-tuning large-scale models, which significantly increases training costs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named LATex for AG-ReID, which adopts prompt-tuning strategies to leverage attribute-based text knowledge. Specifically, with the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, we first propose an Attribute-aware Image Encoder (AIE) to extract both global semantic features and attribute-aware features from input images. Then, with these features, we propose a Prompted Attribute Classifier Group (PACG) to predict person attributes and obtain attribute representations. Finally, we design a Coupled Prompt Template (CPT) to transform attribute representations and view information into structured sentences. These sentences are processed by the text encoder of CLIP to generate more discriminative features. As a result, our framework can fully leverage attribute-based text knowledge to improve AG-ReID performance. Extensive experiments on three AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks: single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks, and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for, compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models (LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS, which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection, cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluating Perspectival Biases in Cross-Modal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26861v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval systems are expected to operate in a semantic space, agnostic to the language or cultural origin of the query. In practice, however, retrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations shaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such biases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from prevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text retrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images culturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in text-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more effective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias remains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that achieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies beyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may be treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic prevalence.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaling Image Geo-Localization to Continent Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26795v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset covering a large part of Europe.

However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind. That is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |
| **[Learning World Models for Interactive Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21996v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices. However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/vrag</p></details> | None |

Although longer captions convey richer information, existing models struggle to process them effectively because of limited text-encoding capacity, and there remains a shortage of resources that align remote sensing images with both short text and long text captions. To address this gap, we introduce DGTRSD, a dual-granularity remote sensing image-text dataset, where each image is paired with both a short text caption and a long text description, providing a solid foundation for dual-granularity semantic modeling. Based on this, we further propose DGTRS-CLIP, a dual-granularity curriculum learning framework that combines short text and long text supervision to achieve dual-granularity semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on four typical zero-shot tasks: long text cross-modal retrieval, short text cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and semantic localization demonstrate that DGTRS-CLIP consistently outperforms existing methods across all tasks.

Existing methods often struggle with complex layouts(e.g., multi-column newspapers), high-overhead interactions between cross-modal elements (visual regions and textual semantics), and a lack of robust evaluation benchmarks. We introduce XY-Cut++, an advanced layout ordering method that integrates pre-mask processing, multi-granularity segmentation, and cross-modal matching to address these challenges. Our method significantly enhances layout ordering accuracy compared to traditional XY-Cut techniques. Specifically, XY-Cut++ achieves state-of-the-art performance (98.8 BLEU overall) while maintaining simplicity and efficiency. It outperforms existing baselines by up to 24\% and demonstrates consistent accuracy across simple and complex layouts on the newly introduced DocBench-100 dataset. This advancement establishes a reliable foundation for document structure recovery, setting a new standard for layout ordering tasks and facilitating more effective RAG and LLM preprocessing.</p></details> |  | None |

However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

To overcome this, we first construct LiRSI-XA dataset, which encompasses approximately $110,000$ remote sensing submaps and $13,000$ LiDAR point cloud submaps captured in urban scenes, and propose a novel method, L2RSI, for cross-view LiDAR place recognition using high-resolution Remote Sensing Imagery. This approach enables large-scale localization capabilities at a reduced cost by leveraging readily available overhead images as map proxies. L2RSI addresses the dual challenges of cross-view and cross-modal place recognition by learning feature alignment between point cloud submaps and remote sensing submaps in the semantic domain. Additionally, we introduce a novel probability propagation method based on particle estimation to refine position predictions, effectively leveraging temporal and spatial information. This approach enables large-scale retrieval and cross-scene generalization without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on LiRSI-XA demonstrate that, within a $100km^2$ retrieval range, L2RSI accurately localizes $83.27\%$ of point cloud submaps within a $30m$ radius for top-$1$ retrieved location.

Existing benchmarks fall short: they are largely single modality (text-only), span short time horizons, use shallow evidence, cover domains unevenly, and often omit full articles -- obscuring models' real-world capability. We present MMM-Fact, a large-scale benchmark of 125,449 fact-checked statements (1995--2025) across multiple domains, each paired with the full fact-check article and multimodal evidence (text, images, videos, tables) from four fact-checking sites and one news outlet. To reflect verification effort, each statement is tagged with a retrieval-difficulty tier -- Basic (1--5 sources), Intermediate (6--10), and Advanced (>10) -- supporting fairness-aware evaluation for multi-step, cross-modal reasoning. The dataset adopts a three-class veracity scheme (true/false/not enough information) and enables tasks in veracity prediction, explainable fact-checking, complex evidence aggregation, and longitudinal analysis.

Recent works have shown promising results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2) inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second, we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions. These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

We introduce a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives. To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition.

In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video captioning framework named Retrieval-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (RETTA), which takes advantage of existing pretrained large-scale vision and language models to directly generate captions with test-time adaptation. Specifically, we bridge video and text using four key models: a general video-text retrieval model XCLIP, a general image-text matching model CLIP, a text alignment model AnglE, and a text generation model GPT-2, due to their source-code availability. The main challenge is how to enable the text generation model to be sufficiently aware of the content in a given video so as to generate corresponding captions. To address this problem, we propose using learnable tokens as a communication medium among these four frozen models GPT-2, XCLIP, CLIP, and AnglE. Different from the conventional way that trains these tokens with training data, we propose to learn these tokens with soft targets of the inference data under several carefully crafted loss functions, which enable the tokens to absorb video information catered for GPT-2. This procedure can be efficiently done in just a few iterations (we use 16 iterations in the experiments) and does not require ground truth data. Extensive experimental results on three widely used datasets, MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX, show absolute 5.1%-32.4% improvements in terms of the main metric CIDEr compared to several state-of-the-art zero-shot video captioning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Pattern Recognition</p></details> | None |

It promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.</p></details> |  | None |

However, developing effective OvOD models for X-ray imaging presents unique challenges due to data scarcity and the modality gap that prevents direct adoption of RGB-based solutions. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAXO, a training-free framework that repurposes off-the-shelf RGB OvOD detectors for robust X-ray detection. RAXO builds high-quality X-ray class descriptors using a dual-source retrieval strategy. It gathers relevant RGB images from the web and enriches them via a novel X-ray material transfer mechanism, eliminating the need for labeled databases. These visual descriptors replace text-based classification in OvOD, leveraging intra-modal feature distances for robust detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAXO consistently improves OvOD performance, providing an average mAP increase of up to 17.0 points over base detectors. To further support research in this emerging field, we also introduce DET-COMPASS, a new benchmark featuring bounding box annotations for over 300 object categories, enabling large-scale evaluation of OvOD in X-ray.

However, these models often struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance. Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++.

We model each buyer's valuation of a dataset with a natural coverage-based valuation function that increases with the inclusion of more relevant data points that would enhance responses to anticipated queries. Motivated by issues such as data control and prior-free revenue maximization, we focus on the scenario where each data point can be allocated to only one buyer. We show that the problem of welfare maximization in this setting is NP-hard even with two bidders, but design a polynomial-time $(1-1/e)$ approximation algorithm for any number of bidders. Unfortunately, however, this efficient allocation algorithm fails to be incentive compatible. The crux of our approach is a carefully tailored post-processing step called data burning which retains the $(1-1/e)$ approximation factor but achieves incentive compatibility. Our thorough experiments on synthetic and real-world image and text datasets demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our algorithm compared to popular baseline algorithms for combinatorial auctions.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically, salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MDReID: Modality-Decoupled Learning for Any-to-Any Multi-Modal Object Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23301v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors (e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components: modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of 9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios, respectively.

However, SMB documents are often difficult to parse. They are rarely born digital and instead are distributed as scanned images that are none machine readable. The scans themselves are low in resolution, affected by skew or rotation, and often contain noisy backgrounds. These documents also tend to be heterogeneous, mixing narratives, tables, figures, and multilingual content within the same report. Such characteristics pose major challenges for automated information extraction, especially when relying on end to end large Vision Language Models, which are computationally expensive, sensitive to noise, and slow when applied to files with hundreds of pages. We propose a multistage pipeline that leverages traditional image processing models and OCR extraction, together with compact VLMs for structured field extraction of large-scale financial documents. Our approach begins with image pre-processing, including segmentation, orientation detection, and size normalization. Multilingual OCR is then applied to recover page-level text. Upon analyzing the text information, pages are retrieved for coherent sections. Finally, compact VLMs are operated within these narrowed-down scopes to extract structured financial indicators. Our approach is evaluated using an internal corpus of multi-lingual, scanned financial documents. The results demonstrate that compact VLMs, together with a multistage pipeline, achieves 8.8 times higher field level accuracy relative to directly feeding the whole document into large VLMs, only at 0.7 percent of the GPU cost and 92.6 percent less end-to-end service latency.</p></details> |  | None |

In comparison with traditional rule or small-model based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline orchestration. From a modality perspective, we review LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., NL2SQL, NL2GQL, ModelQA), (ii) semi-structured data (e.g., markup languages understanding, semi-structured table question answering), (iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, text/image document understanding), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g., data retrieval and modality alignment in data lakes). The technical evolution further distills four key design goals for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows, and support for open-world tasks. Finally, we outline the remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.</p></details> | 31 page, 9 figures | None |

While recent methods condition diffusion on glyphs, it is impossible to retrieve exact font annotations from large-scale, real-world datasets, which prevents user-specified font control. To address this, we propose a data-driven solution that integrates the conditional diffusion model with a text segmentation model, utilizing segmentation masks to capture and represent fonts in pixel space in a self-supervised manner, thereby eliminating the need for any ground-truth labels and enabling users to customize text rendering with any multilingual font of their choice. The experiment provides a proof of concept of our algorithm in zero-shot text and font editing across diverse fonts and languages, providing valuable insights for the community and industry toward achieving generalized visual text rendering.

Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we introduce a unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these models to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as the difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a generalized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other applies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins, sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation, allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern. Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall. Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 14 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.13725</p></details> | None |

A Study of Gender and Racial Disparities in Multilingual Contrastive Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14160v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual vision-language models (VLMs) promise universal image-text retrieval, yet their social biases remain underexplored. We perform the first systematic audit of four public multilingual CLIP variants: M-CLIP, NLLB-CLIP, CAPIVARA-CLIP, and the debiased SigLIP-2, covering ten languages that differ in resource availability and morphological gender marking. Using balanced subsets of FairFace and the PATA stereotype suite in a zero-shot setting, we quantify race and gender bias and measure stereotype amplification. Contrary to the intuition that multilinguality mitigates bias, every model exhibits stronger gender skew than its English-only baseline. CAPIVARA-CLIP shows its largest biases precisely in the low-resource languages it targets, while the shared encoder of NLLB-CLIP and SigLIP-2 transfers English gender stereotypes into gender-neutral languages; loosely coupled encoders largely avoid this leakage. Although SigLIP-2 reduces agency and communion skews, it inherits -- and in caption-sparse contexts (e.g., Xhosa) amplifies -- the English anchor's crime associations. Highly gendered languages consistently magnify all bias types, yet gender-neutral languages remain vulnerable whenever cross-lingual weight sharing imports foreign stereotypes. Aggregated metrics thus mask language-specific hot spots, underscoring the need for fine-grained, language-aware bias evaluation in future multilingual VLM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNLP-AACL 2025</p></details> | None |

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16 languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability. Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med, LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity, and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning, improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and explainable medical VLMs.</p></details> | First version | None |

While recent advancements in self-supervised learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The code and datasets will be released soon.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

Existing large language model (LLM)-based systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty, resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals. Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score, outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures.

| **[SWAN: Self-supervised Wavelet Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Unmixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22607v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse, distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative, quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact network parameters for practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Open Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Factual Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22521v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional, and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed, comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting. Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces dependence on extensive labeled datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

These tasks have gained increasing attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution, and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding. Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis, reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising directions for future research.

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in VLM research.</p></details> |  | None |

One application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings. However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that, given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire similar efforts in other educational contexts.</p></details> |  | None |

However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

The rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has enabled a rethinking of geo-localization as a reasoning-driven task grounded in visual cues. However, two major challenges persist. On the data side, existing reasoning-focused datasets are primarily based on street-view imagery, offering limited scene diversity and constrained viewpoints. On the modeling side, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which yields only marginal improvements in reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs a reasoning-oriented geo-localization dataset, MP16-Reason, using diverse social media images. We introduce GLOBE, Group-relative policy optimization for Localizability assessment and Optimized visual-cue reasoning, yielding Bi-objective geo-Enhancement for the VLM in recognition and reasoning. GLOBE incorporates task-specific rewards that jointly enhance localizability assessment, visual-cue reasoning, and geolocation accuracy. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that GLOBE outperforms state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on geo-localization tasks, particularly in diverse visual scenes, while also generating more insightful and interpretable reasoning trajectories.

MUVR aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos, tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance) and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3) Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base, Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted.

However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration. To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e., an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BioCAP: Exploiting Synthetic Captions Beyond Labels in Biological Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20095v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure, emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate, instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BioCAP (i.e., BioCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://imageomics.github.io/biocap/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://imageomics.github.io/biocap) |
| **[Panorama: Fast-Track Nearest Neighbors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00566v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TernaryCLIP: Efficiently Compressing Vision-Language Models with Ternary Weights and Distilled Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21879v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones. TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules, preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98 $\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$ storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models, supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices. The model and code can be accessed from Hugging Face and GitHub.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images, while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual multicultural datasets.</p></details> | ACM Multimedia 2025 | None |
| **[VITRIX-CLIPIN: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding in CLIP via Instruction Editing Data and Long Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02329v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
