| **[LOCORE: Image Re-ranking with Long-Context Sequence Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21772v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LOCORE, Long-Context Re-ranker, a model that takes as input local descriptors corresponding to an image query and a list of gallery images and outputs similarity scores between the query and each gallery image. This model is used for image retrieval, where typically a first ranking is performed with an efficient similarity measure, and then a shortlist of top-ranked images is re-ranked based on a more fine-grained similarity measure. Compared to existing methods that perform pair-wise similarity estimation with local descriptors or list-wise re-ranking with global descriptors, LOCORE is the first method to perform list-wise re-ranking with local descriptors. To achieve this, we leverage efficient long-context sequence models to effectively capture the dependencies between query and gallery images at the local-descriptor level. During testing, we process long shortlists with a sliding window strategy that is tailored to overcome the context size limitations of sequence models. Our approach achieves superior performance compared with other re-rankers on established image retrieval benchmarks of landmarks (ROxf and RPar), products (SOP), fashion items (In-Shop), and bird species (CUB-200) while having comparable latency to the pair-wise local descriptor re-rankers.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |
| **[ELIP: Enhanced Visual-Language Foundation Models for Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15682v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective in this paper is to improve the performance of text-to-image retrieval. To this end, we introduce a new framework that can boost the performance of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, so that they can be used for text-to-image re-ranking. The approach, Enhanced Language-Image Pre-training (ELIP), uses the text query, via a simple MLP mapping network, to predict a set of visual prompts to condition the ViT image encoding. ELIP can easily be applied to the commonly used CLIP, SigLIP and BLIP-2 networks. To train the architecture with limited computing resources, we develop a 'student friendly' best practice, involving global hard sample mining, and curation of a large-scale dataset. On the evaluation side, we set up two new out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, Occluded COCO and ImageNet-R, to assess the zero-shot generalisation of the models to different domains. The results demonstrate that ELIP significantly boosts CLIP/SigLIP/SigLIP-2 text-to-image retrieval performance and outperforms BLIP-2 on several benchmarks, as well as providing an easy means to adapt to OOD datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fwd2Bot: LVLM Visual Token Compression with Double Forward Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21757v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a) generative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is storage-efficient. We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot, that uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic manner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a "double-forward pass" training strategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates a bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of summary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the language instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct replacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses: an autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct optimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after the first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for discriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific adapters. We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study. Overall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations suitable for both generative and discriminative tasks. For generative tasks, we offer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative capabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result. For discriminative tasks, we set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FineCIR: Explicit Parsing of Fine-Grained Modification Semantics for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21309v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) facilitates image retrieval through a multimodal query consisting of a reference image and modification text. The reference image defines the retrieval context, while the modification text specifies desired alterations. However, existing CIR datasets predominantly employ coarse-grained modification text (CoarseMT), which inadequately captures fine-grained retrieval intents. This limitation introduces two key challenges: (1) ignoring detailed differences leads to imprecise positive samples, and (2) greater ambiguity arises when retrieving visually similar images. These issues degrade retrieval accuracy, necessitating manual result filtering or repeated queries. To address these limitations, we develop a robust fine-grained CIR data annotation pipeline that minimizes imprecise positive samples and enhances CIR systems' ability to discern modification intents accurately. Using this pipeline, we refine the FashionIQ and CIRR datasets to create two fine-grained CIR datasets: Fine-FashionIQ and Fine-CIRR. Furthermore, we introduce FineCIR, the first CIR framework explicitly designed to parse the modification text. FineCIR effectively captures fine-grained modification semantics and aligns them with ambiguous visual entities, enhancing retrieval precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FineCIR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CIR baselines on both fine-grained and traditional CIR benchmark datasets. Our FineCIR code and fine-grained CIR datasets are available at https://github.com/SDU-L/FineCIR.git.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/SDU-L/FineCIR.git) |

However, deep hashing methods are vulnerable to malicious attacks, including adversarial and backdoor attacks. It is worth noting that these attacks typically involve altering the query images, which is not a practical concern in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we point out that even clean query images can be dangerous, inducing malicious target retrieval results, like undesired or illegal images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study data \textbf{p}oisoning \textbf{a}ttacks against \textbf{d}eep \textbf{hash}ing \textbf{(\textit{PADHASH})}. Specifically, we first train a surrogate model to simulate the behavior of the target deep hashing model. Then, a strict gradient matching strategy is proposed to generate the poisoned images. Extensive experiments on different models, datasets, hash methods, and hash code lengths demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our attack method.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM | None |
| **[Evaluating Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks and Foundation Models as Feature Extractors for Content-based Medical Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09430v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image retrieval refers to the task of finding similar images for given query images in a database, with applications such as diagnosis support. While traditional medical image retrieval relied on clinical metadata, content-based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) depends on image features, which can be extracted automatically or semi-automatically. Many approaches have been proposed for CBMIR, and among them, using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a widely utilized approach. However, considering the recent advances in the development of foundation models for various computer vision tasks, their application for CBMIR can also be investigated. In this study, we used several pre-trained feature extractors from well-known pre-trained CNNs and pre-trained foundation models and investigated the CBMIR performance on eight types of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) medical images. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of image size on the CBMIR performance. Our results show that, overall, for the 2D datasets, foundation models deliver superior performance by a large margin compared to CNNs, with the general-purpose self-supervised model for computational pathology (UNI) providing the best overall performance across all datasets and image sizes. For 3D datasets, CNNs and foundation models deliver more competitive performance, with contrastive learning from captions for histopathology model (CONCH) achieving the best overall performance. Moreover, our findings confirm that while using larger image sizes (especially for 2D datasets) yields slightly better performance, competitive CBMIR performance can still be achieved even with smaller image sizes. Our codes to reproduce the results are available at: https://github.com/masih4/MedImageRetrieval.</p></details> | 37 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/masih4/MedImageRetrieval) |
| **[ILIAS: Instance-Level Image retrieval At Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11748v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces ILIAS, a new test dataset for Instance-Level Image retrieval At Scale. It is designed to evaluate the ability of current and future foundation models and retrieval techniques to recognize particular objects. The key benefits over existing datasets include large scale, domain diversity, accurate ground truth, and a performance that is far from saturated. ILIAS includes query and positive images for 1,000 object instances, manually collected to capture challenging conditions and diverse domains. Large-scale retrieval is conducted against 100 million distractor images from YFCC100M. To avoid false negatives without extra annotation effort, we include only query objects confirmed to have emerged after 2014, i.e. the compilation date of YFCC100M. An extensive benchmarking is performed with the following observations: i) models fine-tuned on specific domains, such as landmarks or products, excel in that domain but fail on ILIAS ii) learning a linear adaptation layer using multi-domain class supervision results in performance improvements, especially for vision-language models iii) local descriptors in retrieval re-ranking are still a key ingredient, especially in the presence of severe background clutter iv) the text-to-image performance of the vision-language foundation models is surprisingly close to the corresponding image-to-image case. website: https://vrg.fel.cvut.cz/ilias/</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |
| **[CoLLM: A Large Language Model for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19910v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that aims to retrieve images based on a multimodal query. Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Scene-agnostic Pose Regression for Visual Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19543v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Absolute Pose Regression (APR) predicts 6D camera poses but lacks the adaptability to unknown environments without retraining, while Relative Pose Regression (RPR) generalizes better yet requires a large image retrieval database. Visual Odometry (VO) generalizes well in unseen environments but suffers from accumulated error in open trajectories. To address this dilemma, we introduce a new task, Scene-agnostic Pose Regression (SPR), which can achieve accurate pose regression in a flexible way while eliminating the need for retraining or databases. To benchmark SPR, we created a large-scale dataset, 360SPR, with over 200K photorealistic panoramas, 3.6M pinhole images and camera poses in 270 scenes at three different sensor heights. Furthermore, a SPR-Mamba model is initially proposed to address SPR in a dual-branch manner. Extensive experiments and studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our SPR paradigm, dataset, and model. In the unknown scenes of both 360SPR and 360Loc datasets, our method consistently outperforms APR, RPR and VO. The dataset and code are available at https://junweizheng93.github.io/publications/SPR/SPR.html.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

| **[From Sparse to Dense: Camera Relocalization with Scene-Specific Detector from Feature Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19358v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel camera relocalization method, STDLoc, which leverages Feature Gaussian as scene representation. STDLoc is a full relocalization pipeline that can achieve accurate relocalization without relying on any pose prior. Unlike previous coarse-to-fine localization methods that require image retrieval first and then feature matching, we propose a novel sparse-to-dense localization paradigm. Based on this scene representation, we introduce a novel matching-oriented Gaussian sampling strategy and a scene-specific detector to achieve efficient and robust initial pose estimation. Furthermore, based on the initial localization results, we align the query feature map to the Gaussian feature field by dense feature matching to enable accurate localization. The experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that STDLoc outperforms current state-of-the-art localization methods in terms of localization accuracy and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Fine-grained Textual Inversion Network for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19296v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) allows users to search target images with a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a modification text that describes the user's modification demand over the reference image. Nevertheless, due to the expensive labor cost of training data annotation, recent researchers have shifted to the challenging task of zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR), which targets fulfilling CIR without annotated triplets. The pioneer ZS-CIR studies focus on converting the CIR task into a standard text-to-image retrieval task by pre-training a textual inversion network that can map a given image into a single pseudo-word token. Despite their significant progress, their coarse-grained textual inversion may be insufficient to capture the full content of the image accurately. To overcome this issue, in this work, we propose a novel Fine-grained Textual Inversion Network for ZS-CIR, named FTI4CIR. In particular, FTI4CIR comprises two main components: fine-grained pseudo-word token mapping and tri-wise caption-based semantic regularization. The former maps the image into a subject-oriented pseudo-word token and several attribute-oriented pseudo-word tokens to comprehensively express the image in the textual form, while the latter works on jointly aligning the fine-grained pseudo-word tokens to the real-word token embedding space based on a BLIP-generated image caption template. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TIGeR: Unifying Text-to-Image Generation and Retrieval with Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05814v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How humans can effectively and efficiently acquire images has always been a perennial question. A classic solution is text-to-image retrieval from an existing database; however, the limited database typically lacks creativity. By contrast, recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation have made it possible to produce attractive and counterfactual visual content, but it faces challenges in synthesizing knowledge-intensive images. In this work, we rethink the relationship between text-to-image generation and retrieval, proposing a unified framework for both tasks with one single Large Multimodal Model (LMM). Specifically, we first explore the intrinsic discriminative abilities of LMMs and introduce an efficient generative retrieval method for text-to-image retrieval in a training-free manner. Subsequently, we unify generation and retrieval autoregressively and propose an autonomous decision mechanism to choose the best-matched one between generated and retrieved images as the response to the text prompt. To standardize the evaluation of unified text-to-image generation and retrieval, we construct TIGeR-Bench, a benchmark spanning both creative and knowledge-intensive domains. Extensive experiments on TIGeR-Bench and two retrieval benchmarks, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera-ready</p></details> | None |
| **[LocDiffusion: Identifying Locations on Earth by Diffusing in the Hilbert Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18142v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image geolocalization is a fundamental yet challenging task, aiming at inferring the geolocation on Earth where an image is taken. Existing methods approach it either via grid-based classification or via image retrieval. Their performance significantly suffers when the spatial distribution of test images does not align with such choices. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage diffusion as a mechanism for image geolocalization. To avoid the problematic manifold reprojection step in diffusion, we developed a novel spherical positional encoding-decoding framework, which encodes points on a spherical surface (e.g., geolocations on Earth) into a Hilbert space of Spherical Harmonics coefficients and decodes points (geolocations) by mode-seeking. We call this type of position encoding Spherical Harmonics Dirac Delta (SHDD) Representation. We also propose a novel SirenNet-based architecture called CS-UNet to learn the conditional backward process in the latent SHDD space by minimizing a latent KL-divergence loss. We train a conditional latent diffusion model called LocDiffusion that generates geolocations under the guidance of images -- to the best of our knowledge, the first generative model for image geolocalization by diffusing geolocation information in a hidden location embedding space. We evaluate our method against SOTA image geolocalization baselines. LocDiffusion achieves competitive geolocalization performance and demonstrates significantly stronger generalizability to unseen geolocations.</p></details> |  | None |

An Explorative Study of Time Awareness Learned from Static Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17899v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time becomes visible through illumination changes in what we see. Inspired by this, in this paper we explore the potential to learn time awareness from static images, trying to answer: what time tells us? To this end, we first introduce a Time-Oriented Collection (TOC) dataset, which contains 130,906 images with reliable timestamps. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a Time-Image Contrastive Learning (TICL) approach to jointly model timestamps and related visual representations through cross-modal contrastive learning. We found that the proposed TICL, 1) not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the timestamp estimation task, over various benchmark metrics, 2) but also, interestingly, though only seeing static images, the time-aware embeddings learned from TICL show strong capability in several time-aware downstream tasks such as time-based image retrieval, video scene classification, and time-aware image editing. Our findings suggest that time-related visual cues can be learned from static images and are beneficial for various vision tasks, laying a foundation for future research on understanding time-related visual context.

| **[good4cir: Generating Detailed Synthetic Captions for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17871v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval (CIR) enables users to search images using a reference image combined with textual modifications. Recent advances in vision-language models have improved CIR, but dataset limitations remain a barrier. Existing datasets often rely on simplistic, ambiguous, or insufficient manual annotations, hindering fine-grained retrieval. We introduce good4cir, a structured pipeline leveraging vision-language models to generate high-quality synthetic annotations. Our method involves: (1) extracting fine-grained object descriptions from query images, (2) generating comparable descriptions for target images, and (3) synthesizing textual instructions capturing meaningful transformations between images. This reduces hallucination, enhances modification diversity, and ensures object-level consistency. Applying our method improves existing datasets and enables creating new datasets across diverse domains. Results demonstrate improved retrieval accuracy for CIR models trained on our pipeline-generated datasets. We release our dataset construction framework to support further research in CIR and multi-modal retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ChatReID: Open-ended Interactive Person Retrieval via Hierarchical Progressive Tuning for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19958v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a crucial task in computer vision, aiming to recognize individuals across non-overlapping camera views. While recent advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in logical reasoning and multi-task generalization, their applications in Re-ID tasks remain limited. They either struggle to perform accurate matching based on identity-relevant features or assist image-dominated branches as auxiliary semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ChatReID, that shifts the focus towards a text-side-dominated retrieval paradigm, enabling flexible and interactive re-identification. To integrate the reasoning abilities of language models into Re-ID pipelines, We first present a large-scale instruction dataset, which contains more than 8 million prompts to promote the model fine-tuning. Next. we introduce a hierarchical progressive tuning strategy, which endows Re-ID ability through three stages of tuning, i.e., from person attribute understanding to fine-grained image retrieval and to multi-modal task reasoning. Extensive experiments across ten popular benchmarks demonstrate that ChatReID outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in all Re-ID tasks. More experiments demonstrate that ChatReID not only has the ability to recognize fine-grained details but also to integrate them into a coherent reasoning process.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Missing Target-Relevant Information Prediction with World Model for Accurate Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17109v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) involves diverse tasks with a broad range of visual content manipulation intent across domain, scene, object, and attribute. The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference image according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image, especially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network, named PrediCIR, to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference images in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a world view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain visual content of a target view, coupled with an action that includes the manipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs. Then, a target content prediction module trains a world model as a predictor to adaptively predict the missing visual information guided by user intention in manipulating text at the latent space. The two modules map an image with the predicted relevant information to a pseudo-word token without extra supervision. Our model shows strong generalization ability on six ZS-CIR tasks. It obtains consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.73% to 4.45% over the best methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

| **[Cross-Modality Perturbation Synergy Attack for Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10090v6)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant research focusing on addressing security concerns in single-modal person re-identification (ReID) systems that are based on RGB images. However, the safety of cross-modality scenarios, which are more commonly encountered in practical applications involving images captured by infrared cameras, has not received adequate attention. The main challenge in cross-modality ReID lies in effectively dealing with visual differences between different modalities. For instance, infrared images are typically grayscale, unlike visible images that contain color information. Existing attack methods have primarily focused on the characteristics of the visible image modality, overlooking the features of other modalities and the variations in data distribution among different modalities. This oversight can potentially undermine the effectiveness of these methods in image retrieval across diverse modalities. This study represents the first exploration into the security of cross-modality ReID models and proposes a universal perturbation attack specifically designed for cross-modality ReID. This attack optimizes perturbations by leveraging gradients from diverse modality data, thereby disrupting the discriminator and reinforcing the differences between modalities. We conducted experiments on three widely used cross-modality datasets, namely RegDB, SYSU, and LLCM. The results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our method but also provide insights for future improvements in the robustness of cross-modality ReID systems.

However, contemporary methods exhibit significant limitations in semantic preservation, contextual integrity, and information redundancy, which constrains retrieval efficacy. We present PromptHash, an innovative framework leveraging affinity prompt-aware collaborative learning for adaptive cross-modal hashing. We propose an end-to-end framework for affinity-prompted collaborative hashing, with the following fundamental technical contributions: (i) a text affinity prompt learning mechanism that preserves contextual information while maintaining parameter efficiency, (ii) an adaptive gated selection fusion architecture that synthesizes State Space Model with Transformer network for precise cross-modal feature integration, and (iii) a prompt affinity alignment strategy that bridges modal heterogeneity through hierarchical contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first investigation into affinity prompt awareness within collaborative cross-modal adaptive hash learning, establishing a paradigm for enhanced semantic consistency across modalities. Through comprehensive evaluation on three benchmark multi-label datasets, PromptHash demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing approaches. Notably, on the NUS-WIDE dataset, our method achieves significant gains of 18.22% and 18.65% in image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks, respectively.

Training performant detection models require diverse, precisely annotated, and large scale datasets that involve complex and expensive creation processes. Hence, there are only few public 3D datasets that are additionally limited in their range of classes. In this work, we propose a pipeline for automatic generation of 3D datasets for arbitrary objects. By utilizing the universal 3D representation and rendering capabilities of Radiance Fields, our pipeline generates high quality 3D models for arbitrary objects. These 3D models serve as input for a synthetic dataset generator. Our pipeline is fast, easy to use and has a high degree of automation.

| **[PQPP: A Joint Benchmark for Text-to-Image Prompt and Query Performance Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04746v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has recently emerged as a viable alternative to text-to-image retrieval, driven by the visually impressive results of generative diffusion models. Although query performance prediction is an active research topic in information retrieval, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior study that analyzes the difficulty of queries (referred to as prompts) in text-to-image generation, based on human judgments. To this end, we introduce the first dataset of prompts which are manually annotated in terms of image generation performance. Additionally, we extend these evaluations to text-to-image retrieval by collecting manual annotations that represent retrieval performance. We thus establish the first joint benchmark for prompt and query performance prediction (PQPP) across both tasks, comprising over 10K queries. Our benchmark enables (i) the comparative assessment of prompt/query difficulty in both image generation and image retrieval, and (ii) the evaluation of prompt/query performance predictors addressing both generation and retrieval. We evaluate several pre- and post-generation/retrieval performance predictors, thus providing competitive baselines for future research.

| **[An Efficient Post-hoc Framework for Reducing Task Discrepancy of Text Encoders for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09188v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve a target image based on a reference image and conditioning text, enabling controllable image searches. The mainstream Zero-Shot (ZS) CIR methods bypass the need for expensive training CIR triplets by projecting image embeddings into the text token embedding space, forming a composed query for retrieval. However, we highlight an inherent limitation in these projection-based CIR: a task discrepancy of text encoders between the original pre-training task of the encoders (text $\leftrightarrow$ image) and the target CIR task (image + text $\leftrightarrow$ image), which potentially negatively impacts CIR performance. To reduce such a discrepancy, a naive solution would be to train both image and text encoders with CIR triplets in a supervised manner. Instead, we introduce Reducing Task Discrepancy of Text Encoders (RTD), an efficient text-only post-hoc framework that complements projection-based CIR methods. We devise a novel target-anchored text contrastive learning designed to enhance the capability of the text encoder for CIR. We also propose two key enhancements: (1) a hard negative-based refined batch sampling strategy and (2) a refined concatenation scheme to further mitigate training-inference discrepancy. Integrating RTD into state-of-the-art projection-based methods achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, resource-intensive state-of-the-art synthetic CIR triplet-based approaches only with 23 minutes of additional training on 4 A100 GPUs (up to $100\times$ faster in training).

| **[SketchYourSeg: Mask-Free Subjective Image Segmentation via Freehand Sketches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16022v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SketchYourSeg, a novel framework that establishes freehand sketches as a powerful query modality for subjective image segmentation across entire galleries through a single exemplar sketch. Unlike text prompts that struggle with spatial specificity or interactive methods confined to single-image operations, sketches naturally combine semantic intent with structural precision. This unique dual encoding enables precise visual disambiguation for segmentation tasks where text descriptions would be cumbersome or ambiguous -- such as distinguishing between visually similar instances, specifying exact part boundaries, or indicating spatial relationships in composed concepts. Our approach addresses three fundamental challenges: (i) eliminating the need for pixel-perfect annotation masks during training with a mask-free framework; (ii) creating a synergistic relationship between sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) models and foundation models (CLIP/DINOv2) where the former provides training signals while the latter generates masks; and (iii) enabling multi-granular segmentation capabilities through purpose-made sketch augmentation strategies. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate superior performance over existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, establishing a new paradigm for user-guided image segmentation that balances precision with efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scale Efficient Training for Large Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13385v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of dataset scales has been a key driver in advancing deep learning research. However, as dataset scale increases, the training process becomes increasingly inefficient due to the presence of low-value samples, including excessive redundant samples, overly challenging samples, and inefficient easy samples that contribute little to model improvement.To address this challenge, we propose Scale Efficient Training (SeTa) for large datasets, a dynamic sample pruning approach that losslessly reduces training time. To remove low-value samples, SeTa first performs random pruning to eliminate redundant samples, then clusters the remaining samples according to their learning difficulty measured by loss. Building upon this clustering, a sliding window strategy is employed to progressively remove both overly challenging and inefficient easy clusters following an easy-to-hard curriculum.We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic datasets, including ToCa, SS1M, and ST+MJ, each containing over 3 million samples.SeTa reduces training costs by up to 50\% while maintaining or improving performance, with minimal degradation even at 70\% cost reduction. Furthermore, experiments on various scale real datasets across various backbones (CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas) and diverse tasks (instruction tuning, multi-view stereo, geo-localization, composed image retrieval, referring image segmentation) demonstrate the powerful effectiveness and universality of our approach.

However, most prevalent image understanding models focus on visual similarity, and learning visual hierarchies is relatively unexplored. In this work, for the first time, we introduce a learning paradigm that can encode user-defined multi-level complex visual hierarchies in hyperbolic space without requiring explicit hierarchical labels. As a concrete example, first, we define a part-based image hierarchy using object-level annotations within and across images. Then, we introduce an approach to enforce the hierarchy using contrastive loss with pairwise entailment metrics. Finally, we discuss new evaluation metrics to effectively measure hierarchical image retrieval. Encoding these complex relationships ensures that the learned representations capture semantic and structural information that transcends mere visual similarity. Experiments in part-based image retrieval show significant improvements in hierarchical retrieval tasks, demonstrating the capability of our model in capturing visual hierarchies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PDV: Prompt Directional Vectors for Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07215v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) enables image search using a reference image and text prompt without requiring specialized text-image composition networks trained on large-scale paired data. However, current ZS-CIR approaches face three critical limitations in their reliance on composed text embeddings: static query embedding representations, insufficient utilization of image embeddings, and suboptimal performance when fusing text and image embeddings. To address these challenges, we introduce the Prompt Directional Vector (PDV), a simple yet effective training-free enhancement that captures semantic modifications induced by user prompts. PDV enables three key improvements: (1) dynamic composed text embeddings where prompt adjustments are controllable via a scaling factor, (2) composed image embeddings through semantic transfer from text prompts to image features, and (3) weighted fusion of composed text and image embeddings that enhances retrieval by balancing visual and semantic similarity. Our approach serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing ZS-CIR methods with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PDV consistently improves retrieval performance when integrated with state-of-the-art ZS-CIR approaches, particularly for methods that generate accurate compositional embeddings. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging the Vision-Brain Gap with an Uncertainty-Aware Blur Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04207v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can our brain signals faithfully reflect the original visual stimuli, even including high-frequency details? Although human perceptual and cognitive capacities enable us to process and remember visual information, these abilities are constrained by several factors, such as limited attentional resources and the finite capacity of visual memory. When visual stimuli are processed by human visual system into brain signals, some information is inevitably lost, leading to a discrepancy known as the \textbf{System GAP}. Additionally, perceptual and cognitive dynamics, along with technical noise in signal acquisition, degrade the fidelity of brain signals relative to the visual stimuli, known as the \textbf{Random GAP}. When encoded brain representations are directly aligned with the corresponding pretrained image features, the System GAP and Random GAP between paired data challenge the model, requiring it to bridge these gaps. However, in the context of limited paired data, these gaps are difficult for the model to learn, leading to overfitting and poor generalization to new data. To address these GAPs, we propose a simple yet effective approach called the \textbf{Uncertainty-aware Blur Prior (UBP)}. It estimates the uncertainty within the paired data, reflecting the mismatch between brain signals and visual stimuli. Based on this uncertainty, UBP dynamically blurs the high-frequency details of the original images, reducing the impact of the mismatch and improving alignment. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of \textbf{50.9\%} and a top-5 accuracy of \textbf{79.7\%} on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by margins of \textbf{13.7\%} and \textbf{9.8\%}, respectively.

| **[ImageScope: Unifying Language-Guided Image Retrieval via Large Multimodal Model Collective Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10166v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of images in online content, language-guided image retrieval (LGIR) has emerged as a research hotspot over the past decade, encompassing a variety of subtasks with diverse input forms. While the development of large multimodal models (LMMs) has significantly facilitated these tasks, existing approaches often address them in isolation, requiring the construction of separate systems for each task. This not only increases system complexity and maintenance costs, but also exacerbates challenges stemming from language ambiguity and complex image content, making it difficult for retrieval systems to provide accurate and reliable results. To this end, we propose ImageScope, a training-free, three-stage framework that leverages collective reasoning to unify LGIR tasks. The key insight behind the unification lies in the compositional nature of language, which transforms diverse LGIR tasks into a generalized text-to-image retrieval process, along with the reasoning of LMMs serving as a universal verification to refine the results. To be specific, in the first stage, we improve the robustness of the framework by synthesizing search intents across varying levels of semantic granularity using chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. In the second and third stages, we then reflect on retrieval results by verifying predicate propositions locally, and performing pairwise evaluations globally. Experiments conducted on six LGIR datasets demonstrate that ImageScope outperforms competitive baselines. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our design.</p></details> | WWW 2025 | None |
| **[Revisiting Medical Image Retrieval via Knowledge Consolidation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09370v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence and digital medicine increasingly permeate healthcare systems, robust governance frameworks are essential to ensure ethical, secure, and effective implementation. In this context, medical image retrieval becomes a critical component of clinical data management, playing a vital role in decision-making and safeguarding patient information. Existing methods usually learn hash functions using bottleneck features, which fail to produce representative hash codes from blended embeddings. Although contrastive hashing has shown superior performance, current approaches often treat image retrieval as a classification task, using category labels to create positive/negative pairs. Moreover, many methods fail to address the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue when models encounter external OOD queries or adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel method to consolidate knowledge of hierarchical features and optimisation functions. We formulate the knowledge consolidation by introducing Depth-aware Representation Fusion (DaRF) and Structure-aware Contrastive Hashing (SCH). DaRF adaptively integrates shallow and deep representations into blended features, and SCH incorporates image fingerprints to enhance the adaptability of positive/negative pairings. These blended features further facilitate OOD detection and content-based recommendation, contributing to a secure AI-driven healthcare environment. Moreover, we present a content-guided ranking to improve the robustness and reproducibility of retrieval results. Our comprehensive assessments demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively recognise OOD samples and significantly outperform existing approaches in medical image retrieval (p<0.05). In particular, our method achieves a 5.6-38.9% improvement in mean Average Precision on the anatomical radiology dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EFSA: Episodic Few-Shot Adaptation for Text-to-Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00139v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image retrieval is a critical task for managing diverse visual content, but common benchmarks for the task rely on small, single-domain datasets that fail to capture real-world complexity. Pre-trained vision-language models tend to perform well with easy negatives but struggle with hard negatives--visually similar yet incorrect images--especially in open-domain scenarios. To address this, we introduce Episodic Few-Shot Adaptation (EFSA), a novel test-time framework that adapts pre-trained models dynamically to a query's domain by fine-tuning on top-k retrieved candidates and synthetic captions generated for them. EFSA improves performance across diverse domains while preserving generalization, as shown in evaluations on queries from eight highly distinct visual domains and an open-domain retrieval pool of over one million images. Our work highlights the potential of episodic few-shot adaptation to enhance robustness in the critical and understudied task of open-domain text-to-image retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

While many previous works have achieved AVL with image retrieval and matching techniques, research in low-altitude multi-view scenarios still remains limited. Low-altitude Multi-view condition presents greater challenges due to extreme viewpoint changes. To explore the best UAV AVL approach in such condition, we proposed this benchmark. Firstly, a large-scale Low-altitude Multi-view dataset called AnyVisLoc was constructed. This dataset includes 18,000 images captured at multiple scenes and altitudes, along with 2.5D reference maps containing aerial photogrammetry maps and historical satellite maps. Secondly, a unified framework was proposed to integrate the state-of-the-art AVL approaches and comprehensively test their performance. The best combined method was chosen as the baseline and the key factors that influencing localization accuracy are thoroughly analyzed based on it. This baseline achieved a 74.1% localization accuracy within 5m under Low-altitude, Multi-view conditions. In addition, a novel retrieval metric called PDM@K was introduced to better align with the characteristics of the UAV AVL task. Overall, this benchmark revealed the challenges of Low-altitude, Multi-view UAV AVL and provided valuable guidance for future research.

Recent advancements like long-context LMMs have allowed them to ingest larger, or even multiple, images. However, the ability to process a large number of visual tokens does not guarantee effective retrieval and reasoning for multi-image question answering (MIQA), especially in real-world applications like photo album searches or satellite imagery analysis. In this work, we first assess the limitations of current benchmarks for long-context LMMs. We address these limitations by introducing a new vision-centric, long-context benchmark, "Visual Haystacks (VHs)". We comprehensively evaluate both open-source and proprietary models on VHs, and demonstrate that these models struggle when reasoning across potentially unrelated images, perform poorly on cross-image reasoning, as well as exhibit biases based on the placement of key information within the context window. Towards a solution, we introduce MIRAGE (Multi-Image Retrieval Augmented Generation), an open-source, lightweight visual-RAG framework that processes up to 10k images on a single 40G A100 GPU -- far surpassing the 1k-image limit of contemporary models. MIRAGE demonstrates up to 13% performance improvement over existing open-source LMMs on VHs, sets a new state-of-the-art on the RetVQA multi-image QA benchmark, and achieves competitive performance on single-image QA with state-of-the-art LMMs. Our dataset, model, and code are available at: https://visual-haystacks.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025; Project page: https://visual-haystacks.github.io</p></details> | None |

The key challenge in this setting is constructing a single image descriptor, for scalable and efficient search, that effectively represents all objects in the image. In this paper, we first analyze the limitations of existing methods on this challenging task and then introduce new benchmarks to support SoIR evaluation. Next, we introduce Multi-object Attention Optimization (MaO), a novel retrieval framework which incorporates a dedicated multi-object pre-training phase. This is followed by a refinement process that leverages attention-based feature extraction with object masks, integrating them into a single unified image descriptor. Our MaO approach significantly outperforms existing retrieval methods and strong baselines, achieving notable improvements in both zero-shot and lightweight multi-object fine-tuning. We hope this work will lay the groundwork and inspire further research to enhance retrieval performance for this highly practical task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Hashing Based on Reconstruction With Part Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07037v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hashing algorithms have been widely used in large-scale image retrieval tasks, especially for seen class data. Zero-shot hashing algorithms have been proposed to handle unseen class data. The key technique in these algorithms involves learning features from seen classes and transferring them to unseen classes, that is, aligning the feature embeddings between the seen and unseen classes. Most existing zero-shot hashing algorithms use the shared attributes between the two classes of interest to complete alignment tasks. However, the attributes are always described for a whole image, even though they represent specific parts of the image. Hence, these methods ignore the importance of aligning attributes with the corresponding image parts, which explicitly introduces noise and reduces the accuracy achieved when aligning the features of seen and unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose a new zero-shot hashing method called RAZH. We first use a clustering algorithm to group similar patches to image parts for attribute matching and then replace the image parts with the corresponding attribute vectors, gradually aligning each part with its nearest attribute. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the superiority of the RAZH method over several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Gaining a deeper understanding of robot design data can enable various applications, including automated design generation, retrieving example designs from text, and developing AI-powered design assistants.

In this paper, we introduce RoboDesign1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1 million samples. Our dataset features multimodal data collected from scientific literature, covering various robotics domains. We propose a semi-automated data collection pipeline, enabling efficient and diverse data acquisition. To assess the effectiveness of RoboDesign1M, we conduct extensive experiments across multiple tasks, including design image generation, visual question answering about designs, and design image retrieval. The results demonstrate that our dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark for design understanding tasks and has the potential to advance research in this field.

A commonly used two-stage strategy involves global retrieval followed by re-ranking using patch-level descriptors. Most deep learning-based methods in an end-to-end manner cannot extract global features with sufficient semantic information from RGB images. In contrast, re-ranking can utilize more explicit structural and semantic information in one-to-one matching process, but it is time-consuming. To bridge the gap between global retrieval and re-ranking and achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose StructVPR++, a framework that embeds structural and semantic knowledge into RGB global representations via segmentation-guided distillation. Our key innovation lies in decoupling label-specific features from global descriptors, enabling explicit semantic alignment between image pairs without requiring segmentation during deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a sample-wise weighted distillation strategy that prioritizes reliable training pairs while suppressing noisy ones. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that StructVPR++ surpasses state-of-the-art global methods by 5-23% in Recall@1 and even outperforms many two-stage approaches, achieving real-time efficiency with a single RGB input.</p></details> |  | None |

One prevalent approach follows the vision-language pretraining paradigm that employs a mapping network to transfer the image embedding to a pseudo-word token in the text embedding space. However, this approach tends to impede network generalization due to modality discrepancy and distribution shift between training and inference. To this end, we propose a Data-efficient Generalization (DeG) framework, including two novel designs, namely, Textual Supplement (TS) module and Semantic-Set (S-Set). The TS module exploits compositional textual semantics during training, enhancing the pseudo-word token with more linguistic semantics and thus mitigating the modality discrepancy effectively. The S-Set exploits the zero-shot capability of pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), alleviating the distribution shift and mitigating the overfitting issue from the redundancy of the large-scale image-text data. Extensive experiments over four ZS-CIR benchmarks show that DeG outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with much less training data, and saves substantial training and inference time for practical usage.</p></details> |  | None |

Modern retrieval systems face two key challenges: scalability and efficiency. State-of-the-art image retrieval systems train specific neural networks for each dataset, an approach that lacks scalability. Furthermore, since retrieval speed is directly proportional to embedding size, existing systems that use large embeddings lack efficiency. To tackle scalability, recent works propose using off-the-shelf foundation models. However, these models, though applicable across datasets, fall short in achieving performance comparable to that of dataset-specific models. Our key observation is that, while foundation models capture necessary subtleties for effective retrieval, the underlying distribution of their embedding space can negatively impact cosine similarity searches. We introduce Autoencoders with Strong Variance Constraints (AE-SVC), which, when used for projection, significantly improves the performance of foundation models. We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of AE-SVC. Addressing efficiency, we introduce Single-shot Similarity Space Distillation ((SS)$_2$D), a novel approach to learn embeddings with adaptive sizes that offers a better trade-off between size and performance. We conducted extensive experiments on four retrieval datasets, including Stanford Online Products (SoP) and Pittsburgh30k, using four different off-the-shelf foundation models, including DinoV2 and CLIP. AE-SVC demonstrates up to a $16\%$ improvement in retrieval performance, while (SS)$_2$D shows a further $10\%$ improvement for smaller embedding sizes.</p></details> |  | None |

Using this approach, we construct two comprehensive medical imaging retrieval datasets: MIMIC-IR for Chest X-rays and CTRATE-IR for CT scans, providing detailed image-image ranking annotations conditioned on diverse anatomical structures. Furthermore, we develop two retrieval systems, RadIR-CXR and model-ChestCT, which demonstrate superior performance in traditional image-image and image-report retrieval tasks. These systems also enable flexible, effective image retrieval conditioned on specific anatomical structures described in text, achieving state-of-the-art results on 77 out of 78 metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

Given its significant academic and practical value, CIR has become a rapidly growing area of interest in the computer vision and machine learning communities, particularly with the advances in deep learning. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive review of CIR to provide a timely overview of this field. Therefore, we synthesize insights from over 120 publications in top conferences and journals, including ACM TOIS, SIGIR, and CVPR In particular, we systematically categorize existing supervised CIR and zero-shot CIR models using a fine-grained taxonomy. For a comprehensive review, we also briefly discuss approaches for tasks closely related to CIR, such as attribute-based CIR and dialog-based CIR. Additionally, we summarize benchmark datasets for evaluation and analyze existing supervised and zero-shot CIR methods by comparing experimental results across multiple datasets.

While increasing $k$ improves localisation robustness, it also linearly increases computational cost and runtime, creating a significant bottleneck. This paper investigates the relationship between global and local descriptors, showing that greater similarity between the global descriptors of query and database images increases the proportion of feature matches. Low similarity queries significantly benefit from increasing $k$, while high similarity queries rapidly experience diminishing returns. Building on these observations, we propose an adaptive strategy that adjusts $k$ based on the similarity between the query's global descriptor and those in the database, effectively mitigating the feature-matching bottleneck. Our approach optimizes processing time without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on three indoor and outdoor datasets show that AIR-HLoc reduces feature matching time by up to 30\%, while preserving state-of-the-art accuracy. The results demonstrate that AIR-HLoc facilitates a latency-sensitive localisation system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> | None |

Over time, retrieval techniques have evolved from Unimodal Retrieval (UR) to Cross-modal Retrieval (CR) and, more recently, to Composed Multi-modal Retrieval (CMR). CMR enables users to retrieve images or videos by integrating a reference visual input with textual modifications, enhancing search flexibility and precision. This paper provides a comprehensive review of CMR, covering its fundamental challenges, technical advancements, and categorization into supervised, zero-shot, and semi-supervised learning paradigms. We discuss key research directions, including data augmentation, model architecture, and loss optimization in supervised CMR, as well as transformation frameworks and external knowledge integration in zero-shot CMR. Additionally, we highlight the application potential of CMR in composed image retrieval, video retrieval, and person retrieval, which have significant implications for e-commerce, online search, and public security.

However, real-world applications often involve multi-label scenarios, such as image retrieval and medical imaging. Therefore, this paper focuses on the challenging yet practical multi-label class-incremental learning (MLCIL) problem. In addition to the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, MLCIL encounters issues related to feature confusion, encompassing inter-session and intra-feature confusion. To address these problems, we propose a novel MLCIL approach called class-independent increment (CLIN). Specifically, in contrast to existing methods that extract image-level features, we propose a class-independent incremental network (CINet) to extract multiple class-level embeddings for multi-label samples. It learns and preserves the knowledge of different classes by constructing class-specific tokens. On this basis, we develop two novel loss functions, optimizing the learning of class-specific tokens and class-level embeddings, respectively. These losses aim to distinguish between new and old classes, further alleviating the problem of feature confusion. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for improving recognition performance and mitigating forgetting on various MLCIL tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Our key contribution is a test-time Iterative Cluster-free Re-ranking process that leverages gallery-gallery feature information to establish semantic links between query and gallery images. This enables the retrieval of relevant images even when they do not exhibit similar visual features but share underlying semantic concepts. This can be combined with any pre-existing cross-domain feature extraction backbone to improve retrieval performance. However, when combined with a carefully chosen Vision Transformer backbone and combination of zero-shot retrieval losses, our approach yields state-of-the-art results on the Sketchy, TU-Berlin and QuickDraw sketch-based retrieval benchmarks. We show that our re-ranking also improves performance with other backbones and outperforms other re-ranking methods applied with our backbone. Importantly, unlike many previous methods, none of the components in our approach are engineered specifically towards the sketch-based image retrieval task - it can be generally applied to any cross-domain, zero-shot retrieval task.

| **[CoTMR: Chain-of-Thought Multi-Scale Reasoning for Training-Free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20826v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images by integrating information from a composed query (reference image and modification text) without training samples. Existing methods primarily combine caption models and large language models (LLMs) to generate target captions based on composed queries but face various issues such as incompatibility, visual information loss, and insufficient reasoning. In this work, we propose CoTMR, a training-free framework crafted for ZS-CIR with novel Chain-of-thought (CoT) and Multi-scale Reasoning. Instead of relying on caption models for modality transformation, CoTMR employs the Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to achieve unified understanding and reasoning for composed queries. To enhance the reasoning reliability, we devise CIRCoT, which guides the LVLM through a step-by-step inference process using predefined subtasks. Considering that existing approaches focus solely on global-level reasoning, our CoTMR incorporates multi-scale reasoning to achieve more comprehensive inference via fine-grained predictions about the presence or absence of key elements at the object scale. Further, we design a Multi-Grained Scoring (MGS) mechanism, which integrates CLIP similarity scores of the above reasoning outputs with candidate images to realize precise retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoTMR not only drastically outperforms previous methods across four prominent benchmarks but also offers appealing interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure | None |

Here, we developed CT-FM, a large-scale 3D image-based pre-trained model designed explicitly for various radiological tasks. CT-FM was pre-trained using 148,000 computed tomography (CT) scans from the Imaging Data Commons through label-agnostic contrastive learning. We evaluated CT-FM across four categories of tasks, namely, whole-body and tumor segmentation, head CT triage, medical image retrieval, and semantic understanding, showing superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Beyond quantitative success, CT-FM demonstrated the ability to cluster regions anatomically and identify similar anatomical and structural concepts across scans. Furthermore, it remained robust across test-retest settings and indicated reasonable salient regions attached to its embeddings. This study demonstrates the value of large-scale medical imaging foundation models and by open-sourcing the model weights, code, and data, aims to support more adaptable, reliable, and interpretable AI solutions in radiology.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, followed by 9 Extended Data Figures and a Supplementary Information document</p></details> | None |

As the research in LLM extends their capability to handle input modality other than text, e.g. image, several multimodal RAG benchmarks are proposed. Nonetheless, they mainly use textual knowledge bases as the primary source of evidences for augmentation. There still lack benchmarks designed to evaluate images as augmentation in RAG systems and how they leverage visual knowledge. We propose Visual-RAG, a novel Question Answering benchmark that emphasizes visual knowledge intensive questions. Unlike prior works relying on text-based evidence, Visual-RAG necessitates text-to-image retrieval and integration of relevant clue images to extract visual knowledge as evidence. With Visual-RAG, we evaluate 5 open-sourced and 3 proprietary Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), revealing that images can serve as good evidence in RAG; however, even the SoTA models struggle with effectively extracting and utilizing visual knowledge</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures | None |

Despite their impressive performance, VLMs are prone to significant hallucinations, particularly in the form of cross-modal inconsistencies. Building on the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning LLMs, recent advancements have focused on applying direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated datasets to mitigate these issues. Yet, such approaches typically introduce preference signals in a brute-force manner, neglecting the crucial role of visual information in the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Re-Align, a novel alignment framework that leverages image retrieval to construct a dual-preference dataset, effectively incorporating both textual and visual preference signals. We further introduce rDPO, an extension of the standard direct preference optimization that incorporates an additional visual preference objective during fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Re-Align not only mitigates hallucinations more effectively than previous methods but also yields significant performance gains in general visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. Moreover, we show that Re-Align maintains robustness and scalability across a wide range of VLM sizes and architectures. This work represents a significant step forward in aligning multimodal LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and effective cross-modal applications.

Our aim is to learn tokens that can be effective for both discriminative and generative tasks while composing well with words to form new input queries. The targeted concept is specified in terms of a small set of images and a parent concept described using text. We operate on CLIP text features and propose to use a combination of a textual inversion loss and a classification loss to ensure that text features of the learned token are aligned with image features of the concept in the CLIP embedding space. We restrict the learned token to a low-dimensional subspace spanned by tokens for attributes that are appropriate for the given super-class. These modifications improve the quality of compositions of the learned token with natural language for generating new scenes. Further, we show that learned custom tokens can be used to form queries for text-to-image retrieval task, and also have the important benefit that composite queries can be visualized to ensure that the desired concept is faithfully encoded. Based on this, we introduce the method of Generation Aided Image Retrieval, where the query is modified at inference time to better suit the search intent. On the DeepFashion2 dataset, our method improves Mean Reciprocal Retrieval (MRR) over relevant baselines by 7%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adversarially Robust CLIP Models Can Induce Better (Robust) Perceptual Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11725v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring perceptual similarity is a key tool in computer vision. In recent years perceptual metrics based on features extracted from neural networks with large and diverse training sets, e.g. CLIP, have become popular. At the same time, the metrics extracted from features of neural networks are not adversarially robust. In this paper we show that adversarially robust CLIP models, called R-CLIP$_\textrm{F}$, obtained by unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning induce a better and adversarially robust perceptual metric that outperforms existing metrics in a zero-shot setting, and further matches the performance of state-of-the-art metrics while being robust after fine-tuning. Moreover, our perceptual metric achieves strong performance on related tasks such as robust image-to-image retrieval, which becomes especially relevant when applied to "Not Safe for Work" (NSFW) content detection and dataset filtering. While standard perceptual metrics can be easily attacked by a small perturbation completely degrading NSFW detection, our robust perceptual metric maintains high accuracy under an attack while having similar performance for unperturbed images. Finally, perceptual metrics induced by robust CLIP models have higher interpretability: feature inversion can show which images are considered similar, while text inversion can find what images are associated to a given prompt. This also allows us to visualize the very rich visual concepts learned by a CLIP model, including memorized persons, paintings and complex queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML).

| **[Precise GPS-Denied UAV Self-Positioning via Context-Enhanced Cross-View Geo-Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11408v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image retrieval has been employed as a robust complementary technique to address the challenge of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) self-positioning. However, most existing methods primarily focus on localizing objects captured by UAVs through complex part-based representations, often overlooking the unique challenges associated with UAV self-positioning, such as fine-grained spatial discrimination requirements and dynamic scene variations. To address the above issues, we propose the Context-Enhanced method for precise UAV Self-Positioning (CEUSP), specifically designed for UAV self-positioning tasks. CEUSP integrates a Dynamic Sampling Strategy (DSS) to efficiently select optimal negative samples, while the Rubik's Cube Attention (RCA) module, combined with the Context-Aware Channel Integration (CACI) module, enhances feature representation and discrimination by exploiting interdimensional interactions, inspired by the rotational mechanics of a Rubik's Cube. Extensive experimental validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating notable improvements in feature representation and UAV self-positioning accuracy within complex urban environments. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DenseUAV dataset, which is specifically designed for dense urban contexts, and also delivers competitive results on the widely recognized University-1652 benchmark.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |

However, they struggle to generate rare or unseen concepts. To address this challenge, we explore the usage of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with image generation models. We propose ImageRAG, a method that dynamically retrieves relevant images based on a given text prompt, and uses them as context to guide the generation process. Prior approaches that used retrieved images to improve generation, trained models specifically for retrieval-based generation. In contrast, ImageRAG leverages the capabilities of existing image conditioning models, and does not require RAG-specific training. Our approach is highly adaptable and can be applied across different model types, showing significant improvement in generating rare and fine-grained concepts using different base models.

| **[Composite Sketch+Text Queries for Retrieving Objects with Elusive Names and Complex Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08438v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-native speakers with limited vocabulary often struggle to name specific objects despite being able to visualize them, e.g., people outside Australia searching for numbats. Further, users may want to search for such elusive objects with difficult-to-sketch interactions, e.g., numbat digging in the ground. In such common but complex situations, users desire a search interface that accepts composite multimodal queries comprising hand-drawn sketches of difficult-to-name but easy-to-draw objects and text describing difficult-to-sketch but easy-to-verbalize object attributes or interaction with the scene. This novel problem statement distinctly differs from the previously well-researched TBIR (text-based image retrieval) and SBIR (sketch-based image retrieval) problems. To study this under-explored task, we curate a dataset, CSTBIR (Composite Sketch+Text Based Image Retrieval), consisting of approx. 2M queries and 108K natural scene images. Further, as a solution to this problem, we propose a pretrained multimodal transformer-based baseline, STNET (Sketch+Text Network), that uses a hand-drawn sketch to localize relevant objects in the natural scene image, and encodes the text and image to perform image retrieval. In addition to contrastive learning, we propose multiple training objectives that improve the performance of our model. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art retrieval methods for text-only, sketch-only, and composite query modalities.

Despite their success, the textual evidence of authentic images retrieved from the inverse search is directly transmitted to LVLMs, leading to inaccurate or false information in the decision-making phase. To this end, we present E2LVLM, a novel evidence-enhanced large vision-language model by adapting textual evidence in two levels. First, motivated by the fact that textual evidence provided by external tools struggles to align with LVLMs inputs, we devise a reranking and rewriting strategy for generating coherent and contextually attuned content, thereby driving the aligned and effective behavior of LVLMs pertinent to authentic images. Second, to address the scarcity of news domain datasets with both judgment and explanation, we generate a novel OOC multimodal instruction-following dataset by prompting LVLMs with informative content to acquire plausible explanations. Further, we develop a multimodal instruction-tuning strategy with convincing explanations for beyond detection. This scheme contributes to E2LVLM for multimodal OOC misinformation detection and explanation. A multitude of experiments demonstrate that E2LVLM achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods, and also provides compelling rationales for judgments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the impact of these videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video information retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video content. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The results of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated videos on retrieval systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite this success, the mechanisms by which these models utilize training data, particularly the role of memorization, remain unclear. In uni-modal models, both supervised and self-supervised, memorization has been shown to be essential for generalization. However, it is not well understood how these findings would apply to CLIP, which incorporates elements from both supervised learning via captions that provide a supervisory signal similar to labels, and from self-supervised learning via the contrastive objective. To bridge this gap in understanding, we propose a formal definition of memorization in CLIP (CLIPMem) and use it to quantify memorization in CLIP models. Our results indicate that CLIP's memorization behavior falls between the supervised and self-supervised paradigms, with "mis-captioned" samples exhibiting highest levels of memorization. Additionally, we find that the text encoder contributes more to memorization than the image encoder, suggesting that mitigation strategies should focus on the text domain. Building on these insights, we propose multiple strategies to reduce memorization while at the same time improving utility--something that had not been shown before for traditional learning paradigms where reducing memorization typically results in utility decrease.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

The localization process, which has been performed manually for decades, has recently been approached through image retrieval solutions: given an astronaut photo, find its most similar match among a large database of geo-tagged satellite images, in a task called Astronaut Photography Localization (APL). Yet, existing APL approaches are trained only using satellite images, without taking advantage of the millions open-source astronaut photos. In this work we present the first APL pipeline capable of leveraging astronaut photos for training. We first produce full localization information for 300,000 manually weakly labeled astronaut photos through an automated pipeline, and then use these images to train a model, called AstroLoc. AstroLoc learns a robust representation of Earth's surface features through two losses: astronaut photos paired with their matching satellite counterparts in a pairwise loss, and a second loss on clusters of satellite imagery weighted by their relevance to astronaut photography via unsupervised mining. We find that AstroLoc achieves a staggering 35% average improvement in recall@1 over previous SOTA, pushing the limits of existing datasets with a recall@100 consistently over 99%. Finally, we note that AstroLoc, without any fine-tuning, provides excellent results for related tasks like the lost-in-space satellite problem and historical space imagery localization.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current retrieval models primarily focus on natural text-image retrieval, making them insufficiently tailored to educational scenarios due to the ambiguities in the retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a diverse expression retrieval task tailored to educational scenarios, supporting retrieval based on multiple query styles and expressions. We introduce the STEM Education Retrieval Dataset (SER), which contains over 24,000 query pairs of different styles, and the Uni-Retrieval, an efficient and style-diversified retrieval vision-language model based on prompt tuning. Uni-Retrieval extracts query style features as prototypes and builds a continuously updated Prompt Bank containing prompt tokens for diverse queries. This bank can updated during test time to represent domain-specific knowledge for different subject retrieval scenarios. Our framework demonstrates scalability and robustness by dynamically retrieving prompt tokens based on prototype similarity, effectively facilitating learning for unknown queries. Experimental results indicate that Uni-Retrieval outperforms existing retrieval models in most retrieval tasks. This advancement provides a scalable and precise solution for diverse educational needs.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we show that the common practice of individually exploiting the text or image encoders of these powerful multi-modal models is highly suboptimal for intra-modal tasks like image-to-image retrieval. We argue that this is inherently due to the CLIP-style inter-modal contrastive loss that does not enforce any intra-modal constraints, leading to what we call intra-modal misalignment. To demonstrate this, we leverage two optimization-based modality inversion techniques that map representations from their input modality to the complementary one without any need for auxiliary data or additional trained adapters. We empirically show that, in the intra-modal tasks of image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval, approaching these tasks inter-modally significantly improves performance with respect to intra-modal baselines on more than fifteen datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that approaching a native inter-modal task (e.g. zero-shot image classification) intra-modally decreases performance, further validating our findings. Finally, we show that incorporating an intra-modal term in the pre-training objective or narrowing the modality gap between the text and image feature embedding spaces helps reduce the intra-modal misalignment.

Recent approaches align the representation spaces of images and brain activity to enable visual decoding. In this paper, we introduce the use of human-aligned image encoders to map brain signals to images. We hypothesize that these models more effectively capture perceptual attributes associated with the rapid visual stimuli presentations commonly used in visual brain data recording experiments. Our empirical results support this hypothesis, demonstrating that this simple modification improves image retrieval accuracy by up to 21% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Existing image retrieval techniques are adept at handling natural images, which converts images into feature vectors and retrieval similar images according to the closeness of these vectors. Nonetheless, these approaches exhibit limitations when applied to the more specialized and intricate domain of circuit diagrams. This paper presents a novel approach to circuit diagram retrieval by employing a graph representation of circuit diagrams, effectively reformulating the retrieval task as a graph retrieval problem. The proposed methodology consists of two principal components: a circuit diagram recognition algorithm designed to extract the circuit components and topological structure of the circuit using proposed GAM-YOLO model and a 2-step connected domain filtering algorithm, and a hierarchical retrieval strategy based on graph similarity and different graph representation methods for analog circuits. Our methodology pioneers the utilization of graph representation in the retrieval of circuit diagrams, incorporating topological features that are commonly overlooked by standard image retrieval methods.

The ability to identify such concepts and their characteristics without supervision has the potential to improve pre-training methods, and enable novel applications such as fine-grained image retrieval and concept-based outlier detection. In this paper, we introduce ConceptVAE, a novel pre-training framework that detects and disentangles fine-grained concepts from their style characteristics in a self-supervised manner. We present a suite of loss terms and model architecture primitives designed to discretise input data into a preset number of concepts along with their local style. We validate ConceptVAE both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating its ability to detect fine-grained anatomical structures such as blood pools and septum walls from 2D cardiac echocardiographies. Quantitatively, ConceptVAE outperforms traditional self-supervised methods in tasks such as region-based instance retrieval, semantic segmentation, out-of-distribution detection, and object detection. Additionally, we explore the generation of in-distribution synthetic data that maintains the same concepts as the training data but with distinct styles, highlighting its potential for more calibrated data generation. Overall, our study introduces and validates a promising new pre-training technique based on concept-style disentanglement, opening multiple avenues for developing models for medical image analysis that are more interpretable and explainable than black-box approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, current methodologies predominantly depend on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which face two critical limitations: (1) Finetuning imposes prohibitive computational overhead and long-term maintenance costs. (2) Finetuning narrows the pretrained knowledge distribution of MLLMs, reducing their adaptability to novel scenarios. These issues are exacerbated by the inherently dynamic nature of real-world I-TIR systems, where queries and image databases evolve in complexity and diversity, often deviating from static training distributions. To overcome these constraints, we propose Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a paradigm-shifting framework that bypasses MLLM finetuning entirely. DAR synergizes Large Language Model (LLM)-guided query refinement with Diffusion Model (DM)-based visual synthesis to create contextually enriched intermediate representations. This dual-modality approach deciphers nuanced user intent more holistically, enabling precise alignment between textual queries and visually relevant images. Rigorous evaluations across four benchmarks reveal DAR's dual strengths: (1) Matches state-of-the-art finetuned I-TIR models on straightforward queries without task-specific training. (2) Scalable Generalization: Surpasses finetuned baselines by 7.61% in Hits@10 (top-10 accuracy) under multi-turn conversational complexity, demonstrating robustness to intricate, distributionally shifted interactions. By eliminating finetuning dependencies and leveraging generative-augmented representations, DAR establishes a new trajectory for efficient, adaptive, and scalable cross-modal retrieval systems.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these issues, we revisit CLIP-style alignment by training a domain-specific 3D foundation model as an image encoder and demonstrate that modality alignment is feasible with only 62 MRI scans. Our approach is enabled by a simple embedding accumulation strategy required for training in 3D, which scales the amount of negative pairs across batches in order to stabilize training. We perform a thorough evaluation of various design choices, including the choice of backbone and loss functions, and evaluate the proposed methodology on zero-shot classification and image-retrieval tasks. While zero-shot image-retrieval remains challenging, zero-shot classification results demonstrate that the proposed approach can meaningfully align the representations of 3D MRI with tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures.

Construction of the CIR model utilizes triplets that consist of a reference image, modification text describing desired changes, and a target image that reflects these changes. For effectively training CIR models, extensive manual annotation to construct high-quality training datasets, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, is required. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a novel triplet synthesis method by leveraging counterfactual image generation. By controlling visual feature modifications via counterfactual image generation, our approach automatically generates diverse training triplets without any manual intervention. This approach facilitates the creation of larger and more expressive datasets, leading to the improvement of CIR model's performance.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures | None |

Existing works rely on location labels in form of bounding boxes or segmentation masks, increasing annotation costs and limiting dataset expansion. Recognizing that many applications do not require location data, we break this dependency and introduce location-free scene graph generation (LF-SGG). This new task aims at predicting instances of entities, as well as their relationships, without the explicit calculation of their spatial localization. To objectively evaluate the task, the predicted and ground truth scene graphs need to be compared. We solve this NP-hard problem through an efficient branching algorithm. Additionally, we design the first LF-SGG method, Pix2SG, using autoregressive sequence modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three scene graph generation datasets as well as two downstream tasks, image retrieval and visual question answering, and show that our approach is competitive to existing methods while not relying on location cues.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Sample Utilization in Noise-Robust Deep Metric Learning With Subgroup-Based Positive-Pair Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11063v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existence of noisy labels in real-world data negatively impacts the performance of deep learning models. Although much research effort has been devoted to improving the robustness towards noisy labels in classification tasks, the problem of noisy labels in deep metric learning (DML) remains under-explored. Existing noisy label learning methods designed for DML mainly discard suspicious noisy samples, resulting in a waste of the training data. To address this issue, we propose a noise-robust DML framework with SubGroup-based Positive-pair Selection (SGPS), which constructs reliable positive pairs for noisy samples to enhance the sample utilization. Specifically, SGPS first effectively identifies clean and noisy samples by a probability-based clean sample selectionstrategy. To further utilize the remaining noisy samples, we discover their potential similar samples based on the subgroup information given by a subgroup generation module and then aggregate them into informative positive prototypes for each noisy sample via a positive prototype generation module. Afterward, a new contrastive loss is tailored for the noisy samples with their selected positive pairs. SGPS can be easily integrated into the training process of existing pair-wise DML tasks, like image retrieval and face recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world large-scale label noise datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Without any bells and whistles, our SGPS framework outperforms the state-of-the-art noisy label DML methods.

| **[A Resource-Efficient Training Framework for Remote Sensing Text--Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10638v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing text--image retrieval (RSTIR) aims to retrieve the matched remote sensing (RS) images from the database according to the descriptive text. Recently, the rapid development of large visual-language pre-training models provides new insights for RSTIR. Nevertheless, as the complexity of models grows in RSTIR, the previous studies suffer from suboptimal resource efficiency during transfer learning. To address this issue, we propose a computation and memory-efficient retrieval (CMER) framework for RSTIR. To reduce the training memory consumption, we propose the Focus-Adapter module, which adopts a side branch structure. Its focus layer suppresses the interference of background pixels for small targets. Simultaneously, to enhance data efficacy, we regard the RS scene category as the metadata and design a concise augmentation technique. The scene label augmentation leverages the prior knowledge from land cover categories and shrinks the search space. We propose the negative sample recycling strategy to make the negative sample pool decoupled from the mini-batch size. It improves the generalization performance without introducing additional encoders. We have conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on public datasets and expanded the benchmark with some advanced approaches, which demonstrates the competitiveness of the proposed CMER. Compared with the recent advanced methods, the overall retrieval performance of CMER is 2%--5% higher on RSITMD. Moreover, our proposed method reduces memory consumption by 49% and has a 1.4x data throughput during training. The code of the CMER and the dataset will be released at https://github.com/ZhangWeihang99/CMER.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ZhangWeihang99/CMER) |

This is a crucial, fine-grained task that aids in understanding the biology of organisms. The conventional approach involves hand-labeling masks, often for hundreds of images per species, and training a segmentation model to generalize these labels to other images, which can be exceedingly laborious. We present a label-efficient method named Static Segmentation by Tracking (SST). SST is built upon the insight: while specimens of the same species have inherent variations, the traits and parts we aim to segment show up consistently. This motivates us to concatenate specimen images into a ``pseudo-video'' and reframe trait and part segmentation as a tracking problem. Concretely, SST generates masks for unlabeled images by propagating annotated or predicted masks from the ``pseudo-preceding'' images. Powered by Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM~2) initially developed for video segmentation, we show that SST can achieve high-quality trait and part segmentation with merely one labeled image per species -- a breakthrough for analyzing specimen images. We further develop a cycle-consistent loss to fine-tune the model, again using one labeled image. Additionally, we highlight the broader potential of SST, including one-shot instance segmentation on images taken in the wild and trait-based image retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

CIR finds applications in a variety of domains including product retrieval (e-commerce) and web search. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning, wherein models are trained on datasets of labeled triplets such as FashionIQ and CIRR. This poses two significant challenges: (i) curating such triplet datasets is labor intensive; and (ii) models lack generalization to unseen objects and domains. In this work, we propose SCOT (Self-supervised COmpositional Training), a novel zero-shot compositional pretraining strategy that combines existing large image-text pair datasets with the generative capabilities of large language models to contrastively train an embedding composition network. Specifically, we show that the text embedding from a large-scale contrastively-pretrained vision-language model can be utilized as proxy target supervision during compositional pretraining, replacing the target image embedding. In zero-shot settings, this strategy surpasses SOTA zero-shot compositional retrieval methods as well as many fully-supervised methods on standard benchmarks such as FashionIQ and CIRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at WACV 2025 in round 1</p></details> | None |
| **[Risk Controlled Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07336v3)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most image retrieval research prioritizes improving predictive performance, often overlooking situations where the reliability of predictions is equally important. The gap between model performance and reliability requirements highlights the need for a systematic approach to analyze and address the risks associated with image retrieval. Uncertainty quantification technique can be applied to mitigate this issue by assessing uncertainty for retrieval sets, but it provides only a heuristic estimate of uncertainty rather than a guarantee. To address these limitations, we present Risk Controlled Image Retrieval (RCIR), which generates retrieval sets with coverage guarantee, i.e., retrieval sets that are guaranteed to contain the true nearest neighbors with a predefined probability. RCIR can be easily integrated with existing uncertainty-aware image retrieval systems, agnostic to data distribution and model selection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides coverage guarantees to image retrieval. The validity and efficiency of RCIR are demonstrated on four real-world datasets: CAR-196, CUB-200, Pittsburgh, and ChestX-Det.</p></details> |  | None |

The current RSVP decoding methods can perform well in decoding EEG signals within a single RSVP task, but their decoding performance significantly decreases when directly applied to different RSVP tasks without calibration data from the new tasks. This limits the rapid and efficient deployment of RSVP-BCI systems for detecting different categories of targets in various scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this study aims to enhance the cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding performance. First, we design three distinct RSVP tasks for target image retrieval and build an open-source dataset containing EEG signals and corresponding stimulus images. Then we propose an EEG with Language-Image Prior fusion Transformer (ELIPformer) for cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding. Specifically, we propose a prompt encoder based on the language-image pre-trained model to extract language-image features from task-specific prompts and stimulus images as prior knowledge for enhancing EEG decoding. A cross bidirectional attention mechanism is also adopted to facilitate the effective feature fusion and alignment between the EEG and language-image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding, which promotes the RSVP-BCI system from research to practical application.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures | None |

Directly applying 3D brain MR images to machine learning models offers the benefit of effectively learning the brain's structure; however, building the generalized model necessitates a large amount of training data. While models that consider depth direction and utilize continuous 2D slices have demonstrated success in segmentation and classification tasks involving 3D data, concerns remain. Specifically, using general 2D slices may lead to the oversight of pathological features and discontinuities in depth direction information. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no attempts to develop a practical CBIR system that preserves the entire brain's structural information. In this study, we propose an interpretable CBIR method for brain MR images, named iCBIR-Sli (Interpretable CBIR with 2D Slice Embedding), which, for the first time globally, utilizes a series of 2D slices. iCBIR-Sli addresses the challenges associated with using 2D slices by effectively aggregating slice information, thereby achieving low-dimensional representations with high completeness, usability, robustness, and interoperability, which are qualities essential for effective CBIR. In retrieval evaluation experiments utilizing five publicly available brain MR datasets (ADNI2/3, OASIS3/4, AIBL) for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal, iCBIR-Sli demonstrated top-1 retrieval performance (macro F1 = 0.859), comparable to existing deep learning models explicitly designed for classification, without the need for an external classifier. Additionally, the method provided high interpretability by clearly identifying the brain regions indicative of the searched-for disease.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures.

In this study, we propose a new low-dimensional representation (LDR) acquisition method called style encoder adversarial domain adaptation (SE-ADA) to realize content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of brain MR images. SE-ADA reduces domain differences while preserving pathological features by separating domain-specific information from LDR and minimizing domain differences using adversarial learning. In evaluation experiments comparing SE-ADA with recent domain harmonization methods on eight public brain MR datasets (ADNI1/2/3, OASIS1/2/3/4, PPMI), SE-ADA effectively removed domain information while preserving key aspects of the original brain structure and demonstrated the highest disease search accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figures.

However, scalability is hindered by the growing complexity of solutions, mainly due to the abstract nature of fine-grained sketches. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to narrow the gap between the two domains. It mainly facilitates unified mutual information sharing both intra- and inter-samples, rather than treating them as a single feature alignment problem between modalities. Specifically, our approach includes: (i) Employing dual weight-sharing networks to optimize alignment within the sketch and image domain, which also effectively mitigates model learning saturation issues. (ii) Introducing an objective optimization function based on contrastive loss to enhance the model's ability to align features in both intra- and inter-samples. (iii) Presenting a self-supervised Multi-Scale Token Recycling (MSTR) Module featured by recycling discarded patch tokens in multi-scale features, further enhancing representation capability and retrieval performance. Our framework achieves excellent results on CNN- and ViT-based backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. We also introduce Cloths-V1, the first professional fashion sketch-image dataset, utilized to validate our method and will be beneficial for other applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> | None |

However, every synthetic image ultimately originates from the upstream data used to train the generator. Does the intermediate generator provide additional information over directly training on relevant parts of the upstream data? Grounding this question in the setting of image classification, we compare finetuning on task-relevant, targeted synthetic data generated by Stable Diffusion -- a generative model trained on the LAION-2B dataset -- against finetuning on targeted real images retrieved directly from LAION-2B. We show that while synthetic data can benefit some downstream tasks, it is universally matched or outperformed by real data from the simple retrieval baseline. Our analysis suggests that this underperformance is partially due to generator artifacts and inaccurate task-relevant visual details in the synthetic images. Overall, we argue that targeted retrieval is a critical baseline to consider when training with synthetic data -- a baseline that current methods do not yet surpass.

Prior approaches have typically decomposed the UCIR problem into two distinct tasks: intra-domain representation learning and cross-domain feature alignment. However, these segregated strategies overlook the potential synergies between these tasks. This paper introduces ProtoOT, a novel Optimal Transport formulation explicitly tailored for UCIR, which integrates intra-domain feature representation learning and cross-domain alignment into a unified framework. ProtoOT leverages the strengths of the K-means clustering method to effectively manage distribution imbalances inherent in UCIR. By utilizing K-means for generating initial prototypes and approximating class marginal distributions, we modify the constraints in Optimal Transport accordingly, significantly enhancing its performance in UCIR scenarios. Furthermore, we incorporate contrastive learning into the ProtoOT framework to further improve representation learning. This encourages local semantic consistency among features with similar semantics, while also explicitly enforcing separation between features and unmatched prototypes, thereby enhancing global discriminativeness. ProtoOT surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin across benchmark datasets. Notably, on DomainNet, ProtoOT achieves an average P@200 enhancement of 18.17%, and on Office-Home, it demonstrates a P@15 improvement of 3.83%.</p></details> |  | None |

As working on large image datasets becomes standard, solving this task efficiently has gained significant practical importance. Applications include targeted performance analysis of retrieved images using ad-hoc queries and hard example mining during training. Recent advancements in contrastive-based open vocabulary systems have yielded remarkable breakthroughs, facilitating large-scale open vocabulary image retrieval. However, these approaches use a single global embedding per image, thereby constraining the system's ability to retrieve images containing relatively small object instances. Alternatively, incorporating local embeddings from detection pipelines faces scalability challenges, making it unsuitable for retrieval from large databases. In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach to object-centric open-vocabulary image retrieval. Our approach aggregates dense embeddings extracted from CLIP into a compact representation, essentially combining the scalability of image retrieval pipelines with the object identification capabilities of dense detection methods. We show the effectiveness of our scheme to the task by achieving significantly better results than global feature approaches on three datasets, increasing accuracy by up to 15 mAP points. We further integrate our scheme into a large scale retrieval framework and demonstrate our method's advantages in terms of scalability and interpretability.</p></details> | BMVC 2023 | None |

Nevertheless, the substantial quantity of undeciphered OBI characters remains a significant challenge for scholars, while conventional methods of ancient script research are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a cross-font image retrieval network (CFIRN) to decipher OBI characters by establishing associations between OBI characters and other script forms, simulating the interpretive behavior of paleography scholars. Concretely, our network employs a siamese framework to extract deep features from character images of various fonts, fully exploring structure clues with different resolutions by multiscale feature integration (MFI) module and multiscale refinement classifier (MRC). Extensive experiments on three challenging cross-font image retrieval datasets demonstrate that, given undeciphered OBI characters, our CFIRN can effectively achieve accurate matches with characters from other gallery fonts, thereby facilitating the deciphering.</p></details> |  | None |

The current leading approach utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model without any adaptation to the target domain, balancing accuracy and efficiency through additional post-processing. In this work, we propose FOR: Finetuning for Object-centric Open-vocabulary Image Retrieval, which allows finetuning on a target dataset using closed-set labels while keeping the visual-language association crucial for open vocabulary retrieval. FOR is based on two design elements: a specialized decoder variant of the CLIP head customized for the intended task, and its coupling within a multi-objective training framework. Together, these design choices result in a significant increase in accuracy, showcasing improvements of up to 8 mAP@50 points over SoTA across three datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that FOR is also effective in a semi-supervised setting, achieving impressive results even when only a small portion of the dataset is labeled.</p></details> | WACV 2025 | None |

In this study, we develop a DSR that transports everyday objects to specified pieces of furniture based on open-vocabulary instructions. Our approach focuses on retrieving images of target objects and receptacles from pre-collected images of indoor environments. For example, given an instruction "Please get the right red towel hanging on the metal towel rack and put it in the white washing machine on the left," the DSR is expected to carry the red towel to the washing machine based on the retrieved images. This is challenging because the correct images should be retrieved from thousands of collected images, which may include many images of similar towels and appliances. To address this, we propose RelaX-Former, which learns diverse and robust representations from among positive, unlabeled positive, and negative samples. We evaluated RelaX-Former on a dataset containing real-world indoor images and human annotated instructions including complex referring expressions. The experimental results demonstrate that RelaX-Former outperformed existing baseline models across standard image retrieval metrics. Moreover, we performed physical experiments using a DSR to evaluate the performance of our approach in a zero-shot transfer setting.

We propose introducing "no" logical regularization to address the issue of token interaction in inversion. Additionally, we suggest using knowledge distillation to reduce the time complexity of textual inversion. Experimental results show that YUKINO outperforms the existing multi-modal SOTA models by over 8% on the SugarCREPE benchmark, and also achieves significant improvements in image retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods often employ a two-stage process: they first generate a caption for the reference image and then use Large Language Models for reasoning to obtain a target description. However, these methods suffer from missing critical visual details and limited reasoning capabilities, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, training-free one-stage method, One-Stage Reflective Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for ZS-CIR (OSrCIR), which employs Multimodal Large Language Models to retain essential visual information in a single-stage reasoning process, eliminating the information loss seen in two-stage methods. Our Reflective Chain-of-Thought framework further improves interpretative accuracy by aligning manipulation intent with contextual cues from reference images. OSrCIR achieves performance gains of 1.80% to 6.44% over existing training-free methods across multiple tasks, setting new state-of-the-art results in ZS-CIR and enhancing its utility in vision-language applications.

While there have been great advances in visual representation learning, such advances have focused on building better representations for a small number of discrete objects bereft of an understanding of how these objects are interacting. One can observe this limitation in representations learned through captions or contrastive learning -- where the learned model treats an image essentially as a bag of words. Several works have attempted to address this limitation through the development of bespoke learned architectures to directly address the shortcomings in compositional learning. In this work, we focus on simple, and scalable approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that by substantially improving weakly labeled data, i.e. captions, we can vastly improve the performance of standard contrastive learning approaches. Previous CLIP models achieved near chance rate on challenging tasks probing compositional learning. However, our simple approach boosts performance of CLIP substantially and surpasses all bespoke architectures. Furthermore, we showcase our results on a relatively new captioning benchmark derived from DOCCI. We demonstrate through a series of ablations that a standard CLIP model trained with enhanced data may demonstrate impressive performance on image retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Metric Compatible Training for Online Backfilling in Large-Scale Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03767v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backfilling is the process of re-extracting all gallery embeddings from upgraded models in image retrieval systems. It inevitably requires a prohibitively large amount of computational cost and even entails the downtime of the service. Although backward-compatible learning sidesteps this challenge by tackling query-side representations, this leads to suboptimal solutions in principle because gallery embeddings cannot benefit from model upgrades. We address this dilemma by introducing an online backfilling algorithm, which enables us to achieve a progressive performance improvement during the backfilling process while not sacrificing the final performance of new model after the completion of backfilling. To this end, we first propose a simple distance rank merge technique for online backfilling. Then, we incorporate a reverse transformation module for more effective and efficient merging, which is further enhanced by adopting a metric-compatible contrastive learning approach. These two components help to make the distances of old and new models compatible, resulting in desirable merge results during backfilling with no extra computational overhead. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our framework on four standard benchmarks in various settings.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce MegaPairs, a novel data synthesis method that leverages vision language models (VLMs) and open-domain images, together with a massive synthetic dataset generated from this method. Our empirical analysis shows that MegaPairs generates high-quality data, enabling the multimodal retriever to significantly outperform the baseline model trained on 70$\times$ more data from existing datasets. Moreover, since MegaPairs solely relies on general image corpora and open-source VLMs, it can be easily scaled up, enabling continuous improvements in retrieval performance. In this stage, we produced more than 26 million training instances and trained several models of varying sizes using this data. These new models achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across 4 popular composed image retrieval (CIR) benchmarks and the highest overall performance on the 36 datasets provided by MMEB. They also demonstrate notable performance improvements with additional downstream fine-tuning. Our produced dataset, well-trained models, and data synthesis pipeline will be made publicly available to facilitate the future development of this field.</p></details> |  | None |

This is a well-known problem in information retrieval that causes some items to accidentally (and incorrectly) appear relevant to many queries. In this paper, we investigate how attackers can exploit hubness to turn any image or audio input in a multi-modal retrieval system into an adversarial hub. Adversarial hubs can be used to inject universal adversarial content (e.g., spam) that will be retrieved in response to thousands of different queries, as well as for targeted attacks on queries related to specific, attacker-chosen concepts. We present a method for creating adversarial hubs and evaluate the resulting hubs on benchmark multi-modal retrieval datasets and an image-to-image retrieval system based on a tutorial from Pinecone, a popular vector database. For example, in text-caption-to-image retrieval, a single adversarial hub is retrieved as the top-1 most relevant image for more than 21,000 out of 25,000 test queries (by contrast, the most common natural hub is the top-1 response to only 102 queries). We also investigate whether techniques for mitigating natural hubness are an effective defense against adversarial hubs, and show that they are not effective against hubs that target queries related to specific concepts.</p></details> |  | None |

In cross-modal retrieval, many works have focused on retrieving relevant items from natural language queries, while few have explored query suggestion solutions. In this work, we address query suggestion in cross-modal retrieval, introducing a novel task that focuses on suggesting minimal textual modifications needed to explore visually consistent subsets of the collection, following the premise of ''Maybe you are looking for''. To facilitate the evaluation and development of methods, we present a tailored benchmark named CroQS. This dataset comprises initial queries, grouped result sets, and human-defined suggested queries for each group. We establish dedicated metrics to rigorously evaluate the performance of various methods on this task, measuring representativeness, cluster specificity, and similarity of the suggested queries to the original ones. Baseline methods from related fields, such as image captioning and content summarization, are adapted for this task to provide reference performance scores. Although relatively far from human performance, our experiments reveal that both LLM-based and captioning-based methods achieve competitive results on CroQS, improving the recall on cluster specificity by more than 115% and representativeness mAP by more than 52% with respect to the initial query. The dataset, the implementation of the baseline methods and the notebooks containing our experiments are available here: https://paciosoft.com/CroQS-benchmark/</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Three Things to Know about Deep Metric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12432v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses supervised deep metric learning for open-set image retrieval, focusing on three key aspects: the loss function, mixup regularization, and model initialization. In deep metric learning, optimizing the retrieval evaluation metric, recall@k, via gradient descent is desirable but challenging due to its non-differentiable nature. To overcome this, we propose a differentiable surrogate loss that is computed on large batches, nearly equivalent to the entire training set. This computationally intensive process is made feasible through an implementation that bypasses the GPU memory limitations. Additionally, we introduce an efficient mixup regularization technique that operates on pairwise scalar similarities, effectively increasing the batch size even further. The training process is further enhanced by initializing the vision encoder using foundational models, which are pre-trained on large-scale datasets. Through a systematic study of these components, we demonstrate that their synergy enables large models to nearly solve popular benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies attempt to utilize Vision-Language Pre-training Models (VLPMs) with various fusion strategies for addressing the task.However, these methods typically fail to simultaneously meet two key requirements of CIR: comprehensively extracting visual information and faithfully following the user intent. In this work, we propose CIR-LVLM, a novel framework that leverages the large vision-language model (LVLM) as the powerful user intent-aware encoder to better meet these requirements. Our motivation is to explore the advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of LVLM for accurately understanding and responding the user intent. Furthermore, we design a novel hybrid intent instruction module to provide explicit intent guidance at two levels: (1) The task prompt clarifies the task requirement and assists the model in discerning user intent at the task level. (2) The instance-specific soft prompt, which is adaptively selected from the learnable prompt pool, enables the model to better comprehend the user intent at the instance level compared to a universal prompt for all instances. CIR-LVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three prominent benchmarks with acceptable inference efficiency. We believe this study provides fundamental insights into CIR-related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Improving the Efficiency of Visually Augmented Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11148v3)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of autoregressive Language Models (LM) it has been shown that due to reporting bias, LMs lack visual knowledge, i.e. they do not know much about the visual world and its properties. To augment LMs with visual knowledge, existing solutions often rely on explicit images, requiring time-consuming retrieval or image generation systems. This paper shows that explicit images are not necessary to visually augment an LM. Instead, we use visually-grounded text representations obtained from the well-known CLIP multimodal system. For a fair comparison, we modify VALM, a visually-augmented LM which uses image retrieval and representation, to work directly with visually-grounded text representations. We name this new model BLIND-VALM. We show that BLIND-VALM performs on par with VALM for Visual Language Understanding (VLU), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Language Modeling tasks, despite being significantly more efficient and simpler. We also show that scaling up our model within the compute budget of VALM, either increasing the model or pre-training corpus size, we outperform VALM for all the evaluation tasks.</p></details> | COLING 2025 | None |
| **[MVC-VPR: Mutual Learning of Viewpoint Classification and Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09199v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to robustly identify locations by leveraging image retrieval based on descriptors encoded from environmental images. However, drastic appearance changes of images captured from different viewpoints at the same location pose incoherent supervision signals for descriptor learning, which severely hinder the performance of VPR. Previous work proposes classifying images based on manually defined rules or ground truth labels for viewpoints, followed by descriptor training based on the classification results. However, not all datasets have ground truth labels of viewpoints and manually defined rules may be suboptimal, leading to degraded descriptor performance.To address these challenges, we introduce the mutual learning of viewpoint self-classification and VPR. Starting from coarse classification based on geographical coordinates, we progress to finer classification of viewpoints using simple clustering techniques. The dataset is partitioned in an unsupervised manner while simultaneously training a descriptor extractor for place recognition. Experimental results show that this approach almost perfectly partitions the dataset based on viewpoints, thus achieving mutually reinforcing effects. Our method even excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that partition datasets using ground truth labels.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Early detection and appropriate treatment can significantly reduce its impact. While histopathology examinations play a vital role in rapid and accurate diagnosis, they often require experienced medical experts for proper recognition and cancer grading. Automated image retrieval systems have the potential to assist pathologists in identifying cancerous tissues, thereby accelerating the diagnostic process. Nevertheless, proposing an accurate image retrieval model is challenging due to considerable variability among the tissue and cell patterns in histological images. In this work, we leverage the features from foundation models in a novel attention-based adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder model for breast histological image retrieval. Our results confirm the superior performance of models trained with foundation model features compared to those using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (up to 7.7% and 15.5% for mAP and mMV, respectively), with the pre-trained general-purpose self-supervised model for computational pathology (UNI) delivering the best overall performance. By evaluating two publicly available histology image datasets of breast cancer, our top-performing model, trained with UNI features, achieved average mAP/mMV scores of 96.7%/91.5% and 97.6%/94.2% for the BreakHis and BACH datasets, respectively. Our proposed retrieval model has the potential to be used in clinical settings to enhance diagnostic performance and ultimately benefit patients.</p></details> | 29 pages | None |
| **[Image Generation Diversity Issues and How to Tame Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16171v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative methods now produce outputs nearly indistinguishable from real data but often fail to fully capture the data distribution. Unlike quality issues, diversity limitations in generative models are hard to detect visually, requiring specific metrics for assessment. In this paper, we draw attention to the current lack of diversity in generative models and the inability of common metrics to measure this. We achieve this by framing diversity as an image retrieval problem, where we measure how many real images can be retrieved using synthetic data as queries. This yields the Image Retrieval Score (IRS), an interpretable, hyperparameter-free metric that quantifies the diversity of a generative model's output. IRS requires only a subset of synthetic samples and provides a statistical measure of confidence. Our experiments indicate that current feature extractors commonly used in generative model assessment are inadequate for evaluating diversity effectively. Consequently, we perform an extensive search for the best feature extractors to assess diversity. Evaluation reveals that current diffusion models converge to limited subsets of the real distribution, with no current state-of-the-art models superpassing 77% of the diversity of the training data. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Diffusion Models (DiADM), a novel approach that improves diversity of unconditional diffusion models without loss of image quality. We do this by disentangling diversity from image quality by using a diversity aware module that uses pseudo-unconditional features as input. We provide a Python package offering unified feature extraction and metric computation to further facilitate the evaluation of generative models https://github.com/MischaD/beyondfid.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 tables, 12 figures; v2 added acknowledgment</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/MischaD/beyondfid) |

However, existing deep supervised hashing models predominantly focus on generating fixed-length hash codes. This approach fails to address the inherent trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness when using hash codes of varying lengths. To determine the optimal hash code length for a specific task, multiple models must be trained for different lengths, leading to increased training time and computational overhead. Furthermore, the current paradigm overlooks the potential relationships between hash codes of different lengths, limiting the overall effectiveness of the models. To address these challenges, we propose the Nested Hash Layer (NHL), a plug-and-play module designed for existing deep supervised hashing models. The NHL framework introduces a novel mechanism to simultaneously generate hash codes of varying lengths in a nested manner. To tackle the optimization conflicts arising from the multiple learning objectives associated with different code lengths, we further propose an adaptive weights strategy that dynamically monitors and adjusts gradients during training. Additionally, recognizing that the structural information in longer hash codes can provide valuable guidance for shorter hash codes, we develop a long-short cascade self-distillation method within the NHL to enhance the overall quality of the generated hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NHL not only accelerates the training process but also achieves superior retrieval performance across various deep hashing models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hly1998/NHL.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/hly1998/NHL) |
| **[Image Retrieval Methods in the Dissimilarity Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08618v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image retrieval methods rely on metric learning to train backbone feature extraction models that can extract discriminant queries and reference (gallery) feature representations for similarity matching. Although state-of-the-art accuracy has improved considerably with the advent of deep learning (DL) models trained on large datasets, image retrieval remains challenging in many real-world video analytics and surveillance applications, e.g., person re-identification. Using the Euclidean space for matching limits the performance in real-world applications due to the curse of dimensionality, overfitting, and sensitivity to noisy data. We argue that the feature dissimilarity space is more suitable for similarity matching, and propose a dichotomy transformation to project query and reference embeddings into a single embedding in the dissimilarity space. We also advocate for end-to-end training of a backbone and binary classification models for pair-wise matching. As opposed to comparing the distance between queries and reference embeddings, we show the benefits of classifying the single dissimilarity space embedding (as similar or dissimilar), especially when trained end-to-end. We propose a method to train the max-margin classifier together with the backbone feature extractor by applying constraints to the L2 norm of the classifier weights along with the hinge loss. Our extensive experiments on challenging image retrieval datasets and using diverse feature extraction backbones highlight the benefits of similarity matching in the dissimilarity space. In particular, when jointly training the feature extraction backbone and regularised classifier for matching, the dissimilarity space provides a higher level of accuracy.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |

However, the existing MAE based CBIR studies in RS assume that the considered RS images are acquired by a single image sensor, and thus are only suitable for uni-modal CBIR problems. The effectiveness of MAEs for cross-sensor CBIR, which aims to search semantically similar images across different image modalities, has not been explored yet. In this paper, we take the first step to explore the effectiveness of MAEs for sensor-agnostic CBIR in RS. To this end, we present a systematic overview on the possible adaptations of the vanilla MAE to exploit masked image modeling on multi-sensor RS image archives (denoted as cross-sensor masked autoencoders [CSMAEs]) in the context of CBIR. Based on different adjustments applied to the vanilla MAE, we introduce different CSMAE models. We also provide an extensive experimental analysis of these CSMAE models. We finally derive a guideline to exploit masked image modeling for uni-modal and cross-modal CBIR problems in RS.

The surgeon creates a mental map with a pre-operative scan. Then, a surgical assistant performs freehand US scanning during the surgery while the surgeon operates at the remote surgical console. Communicating the target scanning plane in the surgeon's mental map is difficult. Automatic image retrieval can help match intraoperative images to preoperative scans, guiding the assistant to adjust the US probe toward the target plane. Methods: We propose a self-supervised contrastive learning approach to match intraoperative US views to a preoperative image database. We introduce a novel contrastive learning strategy that leverages intra-sweep similarity and US probe location to improve feature encoding. Additionally, our model incorporates a flexible threshold to reject unsatisfactory matches. Results: Our method achieves 92.30% retrieval accuracy on simulated data and outperforms state-of-the-art temporal-based contrastive learning approaches. Our ablation study demonstrates that using probe location in the optimization goal improves image representation, suggesting that semantic information can be extracted from probe location. We also present our approach on real patient data to show the feasibility of the proposed US probe localization system despite tissue deformation from tongue retraction. Conclusion: Our contrastive learning method, which utilizes intra-sweep similarity and US probe location, enhances US image representation learning. We also demonstrate the feasibility of using our image retrieval method to provide neck US localization on real patient US after tongue retraction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |

These environments are typically challenging for conventional vision-based state estimation due to the lack of distinct visual landmarks and the instability of vehicle poses. To address this, BEVRender generates high-quality local bird's-eye-view(BEV) images of the local terrain. Subsequently, these images are aligned with a geo referenced aerial map through template matching to achieve accurate cross-view registration. Our approach overcomes the inherent limitations of visual inertial odometry systems and the substantial storage requirements of image-retrieval localization strategies, which are susceptible to drift and scalability issues, respectively. Extensive experimentation validates BEVRender's advancement over existing GNSS-denied visual localization methods, demonstrating notable enhancements in both localization accuracy and update frequency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by IROS2024</p></details> | None |

CIR is inherently an instruction-following task, as the model needs to interpret and apply modifications to the image. In practice, due to the scarcity of annotated data in downstream tasks, Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR) is desirable. While existing ZS-CIR models based on CLIP have shown promising results, their capability in interpreting and following modification instructions remains limited. Some research attempts to address this by incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these approaches still face challenges in effectively integrating multimodal information and instruction understanding. To tackle above challenges, we propose a novel embedding method utilizing an instruction-tuned Multimodal LLM (MLLM) to generate composed representation, which significantly enhance the instruction following capability for a comprehensive integration between images and instructions. Nevertheless, directly applying MLLMs introduces a new challenge since MLLMs are primarily designed for text generation rather than embedding extraction as required in CIR. To address this, we introduce a two-stage training strategy to efficiently learn a joint multimodal embedding space and further refining the ability to follow modification instructions by tuning the model in a triplet dataset similar to the CIR format. Extensive experiments on four public datasets: FashionIQ, CIRR, GeneCIS, and CIRCO demonstrates the superior performance of our model, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.

While radiologists build such expertise over years of experience, it is challenging for AI models to learn where to look with limited amounts of training data. This limitation results in unsatisfying robustness in medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose Diffusion-based Feature Augmentation (DAug), a portable method that improves a perception model's performance with a generative model's output. Specifically, we extend a radiology image to multiple channels, with the additional channels being the heatmaps of regions where diseases tend to develop. A diffusion-based image-to-image translation model was used to generate such heatmaps conditioned on selected disease classes. Our method is motivated by the fact that generative models learn the distribution of normal and abnormal images, and such knowledge is complementary to image understanding tasks. In addition, we propose the Image-Text-Class Hybrid Contrastive learning to utilize both text and class labels. With two novel approaches combined, our method surpasses baseline models without changing the model architecture, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both medical image retrieval and classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

We show that a strong vision-language model provides sufficient descriptive power without additional training. The query image is mapped to the text input space using textual inversion. Unlike common practice that invert in the continuous space of text tokens, we use the discrete word space via a nearest-neighbor search in a text vocabulary. With this inversion, the image is softly mapped across the vocabulary and is made more robust using retrieval-based augmentation. Database images are retrieved by a weighted ensemble of text queries combining mapped words with the domain text.

We propose a novel visual place recognition approach based on overlap prediction, called VOP, shifting from traditional reliance on global image similarities and local features to image overlap prediction. VOP proceeds co-visible image sections by obtaining patch-level embeddings using a Vision Transformer backbone and establishing patch-to-patch correspondences without requiring expensive feature detection and matching. Our approach uses a voting mechanism to assess overlap scores for potential database images. It provides a nuanced image retrieval metric in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that VOP leads to more accurate relative pose estimation and localization results on the retrieved image pairs than state-of-the-art baselines on a number of large-scale, real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

Although AL has been extensively studied for image classification tasks, the specific scenario of interactive image retrieval has received relatively little attention. This scenario presents unique characteristics, including an open-set and class-imbalanced binary classification, starting with very few labeled samples. We introduce a novel batch-mode Active Learning framework named GAL (Greedy Active Learning) that better copes with this application. It incorporates a new acquisition function for sample selection that measures the impact of each unlabeled sample on the classifier. We further embed this strategy in a greedy selection approach, better exploiting the samples within each batch. We evaluate our framework with both linear (SVM) and non-linear MLP/Gaussian Process classifiers. For the Gaussian Process case, we show a theoretical guarantee on the greedy approximation. Finally, we assess our performance for the interactive content-based image retrieval task on several benchmarks and demonstrate its superiority over existing approaches and common baselines.

We evaluate the systems with respect to indexing time, memory usage, query time, precision, recall, F1-score, and Recall@5 on a custom image dataset. FAISS's Product Quantization can achieve a precision of 98.40% with low memory usage at 0.24 MB index size, and Annoy is the fastest, with average query times of 0.00015 seconds, at a slight cost to accuracy. These results reveal trade-offs among speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency and offer actionable insights into the optimization of feature-based image retrieval systems.

A novel cascading neuron abandoning back-propagation algorithm is designed to trace neurons in all layers of a CNN that involve in making its prediction to address the problem of significant interference from abandoned neurons. Firstly, a Neuron Abandoning Back-Propagation (NA-BP) module is proposed to generate Back-Propagated Feature Maps (BPFM) by using the inverse function of the intermediate layers of CNN models, on which the neurons not used for decision-making are abandoned. Meanwhile, the cascading NA-BP modules calculate the tensors of importance coefficients which are linearly combined with the tensors of BPFMs to form the NAFlow. Secondly, to be able to visualize attention flow for similarity metric-based CNN models, a new channel contribution weights module is proposed to calculate the importance coefficients via Jacobian Matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed NAFlow is validated on nine widely-used CNN models for various tasks of general image classification, contrastive learning classification, few-shot image classification, and image retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods focus on projecting the query image into the text feature space, subsequently combining them with features of query texts for retrieval. However, retrieving images only with the text features cannot guarantee detailed alignment due to the natural gap between images and text. In this paper, we introduce Imagined Proxy for CIR (IP-CIR), a training-free method that creates a proxy image aligned with the query image and text description, enhancing query representation in the retrieval process. We first leverage the large language model's generalization capability to generate an image layout, and then apply both the query text and image for conditional generation. The robust query features are enhanced by merging the proxy image, query image, and text semantic perturbation. Our newly proposed balancing metric integrates text-based and proxy retrieval similarities, allowing for more accurate retrieval of the target image while incorporating image-side information into the process. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves retrieval performances. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the CIRR dataset with a Recall@K of 70.07 at K=10. Additionally, we achieved an improvement in Recall@10 on the FashionIQ dataset, rising from 45.11 to 45.74, and improved the baseline performance in CIRCO with a mAPK@10 score, increasing from 32.24 to 34.26.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

However, the synthetic framework is usually designed with meticulous human effort for each task due to various requirements on image layout, content, and annotation formats, restricting the application of synthetic data on more general scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnySynth, a unified framework integrating adaptable, comprehensive, and highly controllable components capable of generating an arbitrary type of synthetic data given diverse requirements. Specifically, the Task-Specific Layout Generation Module is first introduced to produce reasonable layouts for different tasks by leveraging the generation ability of large language models and layout priors of real-world images. A Uni-Controlled Image Generation Module is then developed to create high-quality synthetic images that are controllable and based on the generated layouts. In addition, user specific reference images, and style images can be incorporated into the generation to task requirements. Finally, the Task-Oriented Annotation Module offers precise and detailed annotations for the generated images across different tasks. We have validated our framework's performance across various tasks, including Few-shot Object Detection, Cross-domain Object Detection, Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval, and Multi-modal Image Perception and Grounding. The specific data synthesized by our framework significantly improves model performance in these tasks, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its practical application is limited by its inability to retrieve classes absent from the training set. To address this limitation, the task has evolved into Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR), where model performance is evaluated on unseen categories. Traditional SBIR primarily focuses on narrowing the domain gap between photo and sketch modalities. However, in the zero-shot setting, the model not only needs to address this cross-modal discrepancy but also requires a strong generalization capability to transfer knowledge to unseen categories. To this end, we propose a novel framework for ZS-SBIR that employs a pair-based relation-aware quadruplet loss to bridge feature gaps. By incorporating two negative samples from different modalities, the approach prevents positive features from becoming disproportionately distant from one modality while remaining close to another, thus enhancing inter-class separability. We also propose a Relation-Aware Meta-Learning Network (RAMLN) to obtain the margin, a hyper-parameter of cross-modal quadruplet loss, to improve the generalization ability of the model. RAMLN leverages external memory to store feature information, which it utilizes to assign optimal margin values. Experimental results obtained on the extended Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets show a sharp improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods in ZS-SBIR.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these two limitations is non-trivial due to the following challenges: 1) how to effectively model the multi-faceted matching factors in a latent way without direct supervision signals; 2) how to fully utilize the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs to improve the generalization ability of the CIR model. To address these challenges, in this work, we first propose a muLtI-faceted Matching Network (LIMN), which consists of three key modules: multi-grained image/text encoder, latent factor-oriented feature aggregation, and query-target matching modeling. Thereafter, we design an iterative dual self-training paradigm to further enhance the performance of LIMN by fully utilizing the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs in a semi-supervised manner. Specifically, we denote the iterative dual self-training paradigm enhanced LIMN as LIMN+. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, FashionIQ, Shoes, and Birds-to-Words, show that our proposed method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Saliency Map-based Image Retrieval using Invariant Krawtchouk Moments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08567v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of digital devices equipped with cameras and the rapid development of Internet technology, numerous content-based image retrieval systems and novel image feature extraction techniques have emerged in recent years. This paper introduces a saliency map-based image retrieval approach using invariant Krawtchouk moments (SM-IKM) to enhance retrieval speed and accuracy. The proposed method applies a global contrast-based salient region detection algorithm to create a saliency map that effectively isolates the foreground from the background. It then combines multiple orders of invariant Krawtchouk moments (IKM) with local binary patterns (LBPs) and color histograms to comprehensively represent the foreground and background. Additionally, it incorporates LBPs derived from the saliency map to improve discriminative power, facilitating more precise image differentiation. A bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) model is employed to generate a codebook for classification and discrimination. By using compact IKMs in the BoVW framework and integrating a range of region-based feature-including color histograms, LBPs, and saliency map-enhanced LBPs, our proposed SM-IKM achieves efficient and accurate image retrieval. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, such as Caltech 101 and Wang, demonstrate that SM-IKM outperforms recent state-of-the-art retrieval methods.

| **[Cross-Modal Pre-Aligned Method with Global and Local Information for Remote-Sensing Image and Text Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14704v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing cross-modal text-image retrieval (RSCTIR) has gained attention for its utility in information mining. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating global and local information due to variations in remote sensing imagery and ensuring proper feature pre-alignment before modal fusion, which affects retrieval accuracy and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose CMPAGL, a cross-modal pre-aligned method leveraging global and local information. Our Gswin transformer block combines local window self-attention and global-local window cross-attention to capture multi-scale features. A pre-alignment mechanism simplifies modal fusion training, improving retrieval performance. Additionally, we introduce a similarity matrix reweighting (SMR) algorithm for reranking, and enhance the triplet loss function with an intra-class distance term to optimize feature learning. Experiments on four datasets, including RSICD and RSITMD, validate CMPAGL's effectiveness, achieving up to 4.65% improvement in R@1 and 2.28% in mean Recall (mR) over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Globally Correlation-Aware Hard Negative Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13145v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hard negative generation aims to generate informative negative samples that help to determine the decision boundaries and thus facilitate advancing deep metric learning. Current works select pair/triplet samples, learn their correlations, and fuse them to generate hard negatives. However, these works merely consider the local correlations of selected samples, ignoring global sample correlations that would provide more significant information to generate more informative negatives. In this work, we propose a Globally Correlation-Aware Hard Negative Generation (GCA-HNG) framework, which first learns sample correlations from a global perspective and exploits these correlations to guide generating hardness-adaptive and diverse negatives. Specifically, this approach begins by constructing a structured graph to model sample correlations, where each node represents a specific sample and each edge represents the correlations between corresponding samples. Then, we introduce an iterative graph message propagation to propagate the messages of node and edge through the whole graph and thus learn the sample correlations globally. Finally, with the guidance of the learned global correlations, we propose a channel-adaptive manner to combine an anchor and multiple negatives for HNG. Compared to current methods, GCA-HNG allows perceiving sample correlations with numerous negatives from a global and comprehensive perspective and generates the negatives with better hardness and diversity. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed GCA-HNG is superior to related methods on four image retrieval benchmark datasets.

| **[Exploiting Contextual Uncertainty of Visual Data for Efficient Training of Deep Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01925v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objects, in the real world, rarely occur in isolation and exhibit typical arrangements governed by their independent utility, and their expected interaction with humans and other objects in the context. For example, a chair is expected near a table, and a computer is expected on top. Humans use this spatial context and relative placement as an important cue for visual recognition in case of ambiguities. Similar to human's, DNN's exploit contextual information from data to learn representations. Our research focuses on harnessing the contextual aspects of visual data to optimize data annotation and enhance the training of deep networks. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We introduce the notion of contextual diversity for active learning CDAL and show its applicability in three different visual tasks semantic segmentation, object detection and image classification, (2) We propose a data repair algorithm to curate contextually fair data to reduce model bias, enabling the model to detect objects out of their obvious context, (3) We propose Class-based annotation, where contextually relevant classes are selected that are complementary for model training under domain shift. Understanding the importance of well-curated data, we also emphasize the necessity of involving humans in the loop to achieve accurate annotations and to develop novel interaction strategies that allow humans to serve as fact-checkers. In line with this we are working on developing image retrieval system for wildlife camera trap images and reliable warning system for poor quality rural roads. For large-scale annotation, we are employing a strategic combination of human expertise and zero-shot models, while also integrating human input at various stages for continuous feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICVGI...</summary><p>ICVGIP, Young Researchers Symposium</p></details> | None |

In this work, we introduce a unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these models to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as the difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a generalized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other applies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins, sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation, allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern. Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall. Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 14 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.13725</p></details> | None |

In this work, we empirically confirm that the key reason causing such an issue is that the training images are usually paired with short captions, leaving certain tokens easily overshadowed by salient tokens. Towards this problem, our initial attempt is to relabel the data with long captions, however, directly learning with which may lead to performance degradation in understanding short text (e.g., in the image classification task). Then, after incorporating corner tokens to aggregate diverse textual information, we manage to help the model catch up to its original level of short text understanding yet greatly enhance its capability of long text understanding. We further look into whether the model can continuously benefit from longer captions and notice a clear trade-off between the performance and the efficiency. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using a self-constructed large-scale dataset, which consists of 100M long caption oriented text-image pairs. Our method demonstrates superior performance in long-text-image retrieval tasks.

| **[Pseudo-triplet Guided Few-shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06001v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging task that aims to retrieve the target image with a multimodal query, i.e., a reference image, and its complementary modification text. As previous supervised or zero-shot learning paradigms all fail to strike a good trade-off between the model's generalization ability and retrieval performance, recent researchers have introduced the task of few-shot CIR (FS-CIR) and proposed a textual inversion-based network based on pretrained CLIP model to realize it. Despite its promising performance, the approach encounters two key limitations: simply relying on the few annotated samples for CIR model training and indiscriminately selecting training triplets for CIR model fine-tuning. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel two-stage pseudo triplet guided few-shot CIR scheme, dubbed PTG-FSCIR. In the first stage, we propose an attentive masking and captioning-based pseudo triplet generation method, to construct pseudo triplets from pure image data and use them to fulfill the CIR-task specific pertaining. In the second stage, we propose a challenging triplet-based CIR fine-tuning method, where we design a pseudo modification text-based sample challenging score estimation strategy and a robust top range-based random sampling strategy for sampling robust challenging triplets to promote the model fine-tuning. Notably, our scheme is plug-and-play and compatible with any existing supervised CIR models. We test our scheme across two backbones on three public datasets (i.e., FashionIQ, CIRR, and Birds-to-Words), achieving maximum improvements of 13.3%, 22.2%, and 17.4% respectively, demonstrating our scheme's efficacy.</p></details> | 10pages | None |

INQUIRE includes iNaturalist 2024 (iNat24), a new dataset of five million natural world images, along with 250 expert-level retrieval queries. These queries are paired with all relevant images comprehensively labeled within iNat24, comprising 33,000 total matches. Queries span categories such as species identification, context, behavior, and appearance, emphasizing tasks that require nuanced image understanding and domain expertise. Our benchmark evaluates two core retrieval tasks: (1) INQUIRE-Fullrank, a full dataset ranking task, and (2) INQUIRE-Rerank, a reranking task for refining top-100 retrievals. Detailed evaluation of a range of recent multimodal models demonstrates that INQUIRE poses a significant challenge, with the best models failing to achieve an mAP@50 above 50%. In addition, we show that reranking with more powerful multimodal models can enhance retrieval performance, yet there remains a significant margin for improvement. By focusing on scientifically-motivated ecological challenges, INQUIRE aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and the needs of real-world scientific inquiry, encouraging the development of retrieval systems that can assist with accelerating ecological and biodiversity research.

| **[Training-free Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval via Weighted Modality Fusion and Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04918v4)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval (CIR), which formulates the query as a combination of a reference image and modified text, has emerged as a new form of image search due to its enhanced ability to capture user intent. However, training a CIR model in a supervised manner typically requires labor-intensive collection of (reference image, text modifier, target image) triplets. While existing zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods eliminate the need for training on specific downstream datasets, they still require additional pretraining on large-scale image datasets. In this paper, we introduce a training-free approach for ZS-CIR. Our approach, Weighted Modality fusion and similarity for CIR (WeiMoCIR), operates under the assumption that image and text modalities can be effectively combined using a simple weighted average. This allows the query representation to be constructed directly from the reference image and text modifier. To further enhance retrieval performance, we employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate image captions for the database images and incorporate these textual captions into the similarity computation by combining them with image information using a weighted average. Our approach is simple, easy to implement, and its effectiveness is validated through experiments on the FashionIQ and CIRR datasets.

Our method is simple: given any pretrained model, we first compute gradients from various self-supervised objectives for each input. These gradients are projected to a lower dimension and then concatenated with the model's output embedding. The resulting features are evaluated on k-nearest neighbor classification over 11 datasets from vision, 5 from natural language processing, and 2 from audio. Across backbones spanning various sizes and pretraining strategies, FUNGI features provide consistent performance improvements over the embeddings. We also show that using FUNGI features can benefit linear classification, clustering and image retrieval, and that they significantly improve the retrieval-based in-context scene understanding abilities of pretrained models, for example improving upon DINO by +17% for semantic segmentation - without any training.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

However, these models typically require extensive document pre-training data to learn intermediate representations and often suffer a significant performance drop in real-world online industrial settings. A primary issue is their heavy reliance on OCR engines to extract local positional information within document pages, which limits the models' ability to capture global information and hinders their generalizability, flexibility, and robustness. In this paper, we introduce GlobalDoc, a cross-modal transformer-based architecture pre-trained in a self-supervised manner using three novel pretext objective tasks. GlobalDoc improves the learning of richer semantic concepts by unifying language and visual representations, resulting in more transferable models. For proper evaluation, we also propose two novel document-level downstream VDU tasks, Few-Shot Document Image Classification (DIC) and Content-based Document Image Retrieval (DIR), designed to simulate industrial scenarios more closely. Extensive experimentation has been conducted to demonstrate GlobalDoc's effectiveness in practical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> | None |

This review examines the development and application of multi-modal language models (MLLMs) in remote sensing, focusing on their ability to interpret and describe satellite imagery using natural language. We cover the technical underpinnings of MLLMs, including dual-encoder architectures, Transformer models, self-supervised and contrastive learning, and cross-modal integration. The unique challenges of remote sensing data--varying spatial resolutions, spectral richness, and temporal changes--are analyzed for their impact on MLLM performance. Key applications such as scene description, object detection, change detection, text-to-image retrieval, image-to-text generation, and visual question answering are discussed to demonstrate their relevance in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster response. We review significant datasets and resources supporting the training and evaluation of these models. Challenges related to computational demands, scalability, data quality, and domain adaptation are highlighted. We conclude by proposing future research directions and technological advancements to further enhance MLLM utility in remote sensing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure | None |

Most CoIR approaches require manually annotated datasets, comprising image-text-image triplets, where the text describes a modification from the query image to the target image. However, manual curation of CoIR triplets is expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we instead propose a scalable automatic dataset creation methodology that generates triplets given video-caption pairs, while also expanding the scope of the task to include composed video retrieval (CoVR). To this end, we mine paired videos with a similar caption from a large database, and leverage a large language model to generate the corresponding modification text. Applying this methodology to the extensive WebVid2M collection, we automatically construct our WebVid-CoVR dataset, resulting in 1.6 million triplets. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark for CoVR with a manually annotated evaluation set, along with baseline results. We further validate that our methodology is equally applicable to image-caption pairs, by generating 3.3 million CoIR training triplets using the Conceptual Captions dataset. Our model builds on BLIP-2 pretraining, adapting it to composed video (or image) retrieval, and incorporates an additional caption retrieval loss to exploit extra supervision beyond the triplet. We provide extensive ablations to analyze the design choices on our new CoVR benchmark. Our experiments also demonstrate that training a CoVR model on our datasets effectively transfers to CoIR, leading to improved state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setup on the CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO benchmarks.

This makes the nature of the training data a significant factor in the efficacy of CLIP for downstream tasks. However, the lack of compositional diversity in contemporary image-text datasets limits the compositional reasoning ability of CLIP. We show that generating ``hard'' negative captions via in-context learning and synthesizing corresponding negative images with text-to-image generators offers a solution. We introduce a novel contrastive pre-training strategy that leverages these hard negative captions and images in an alternating fashion to train CLIP. We demonstrate that our method, named TripletCLIP, when applied to existing datasets such as CC3M and CC12M, enhances the compositional capabilities of CLIP, resulting in an absolute improvement of over 9% on the SugarCrepe benchmark on an equal computational budget, as well as improvements in zero-shot image classification and image retrieval.

In this work, we present the Bidirectional Vision-Language Compositionality (BiVLC) dataset. The novelty of BiVLC is to add a synthetic hard negative image generated from the synthetic text, resulting in two image-to-text retrieval examples (one for each image) and, more importantly, two text-to-image retrieval examples (one for each text). Human annotators filter out ill-formed examples ensuring the validity of the benchmark. The experiments on BiVLC uncover a weakness of current multimodal models, as they perform poorly in the text-to-image direction. In fact, when considering both retrieval directions, the conclusions obtained in previous works change significantly. In addition to the benchmark, we show that a contrastive model trained using synthetic images and texts significantly improves over the base model in SugarCrepe and in BiVLC for both retrieval directions. The gap to human performance in BiVLC confirms that Vision-Language Compositionality is still a challenging problem.

Different types of medical images such as X-rays, MRI, CT scan etc. take up large amounts of space. This volume of data introduces challenges like accessing and retrieving specific images due to the size of the database. An efficient image retrieval system is essential as the database continues to grow to save time and resources. In this paper, we propose an approach to medical image retrieval using DenseNet for feature extraction and use FAISS for similarity search. DenseNet is well-suited for feature extraction in complex medical images and FAISS enables efficient handling of high-dimensional data in large-scale datasets. Unlike existing methods focused solely on classification accuracy, our method prioritizes both retrieval speed and diagnostic relevance, addressing a critical gap in real-time case comparison for radiologists. We applied the classification of breast cancer images using the BIRADS system. We utilized DenseNet's powerful feature representation and FAISSs efficient indexing capabilities to achieve high precision and recall in retrieving relevant images for diagnosis. We experimented on a dataset of 2006 images from the Categorized Digital Database for Low Energy and Subtracted Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CDD-CESM) images available on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Our method outperforms conventional retrieval techniques, achieving a precision of 80% at k=5 for BIRADS classification.

| **[Identifying Implicit Social Biases in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00997v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models, like CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pretraining), are becoming increasingly popular for a wide range of multimodal retrieval tasks. However, prior work has shown that large language and deep vision models can learn historical biases contained in their training sets, leading to perpetuation of stereotypes and potential downstream harm. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the social biases that are present in CLIP, with a focus on the interaction between image and text modalities. We first propose a taxonomy of social biases called So-B-IT, which contains 374 words categorized across ten types of bias. Each type can lead to societal harm if associated with a particular demographic group. Using this taxonomy, we examine images retrieved by CLIP from a facial image dataset using each word as part of a prompt. We find that CLIP frequently displays undesirable associations between harmful words and specific demographic groups, such as retrieving mostly pictures of Middle Eastern men when asked to retrieve images of a "terrorist". Finally, we conduct an analysis of the source of such biases, by showing that the same harmful stereotypes are also present in a large image-text dataset used to train CLIP models for examples of biases that we find. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating and addressing bias in vision-language models, and suggest the need for transparency and fairness-aware curation of large pre-training datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[MoTaDual: Modality-Task Dual Alignment for Enhanced Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23736v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging vision-language task, utilizing bi-modal (image+text) queries to retrieve target images. Despite the impressive performance of supervised CIR, the dependence on costly, manually-labeled triplets limits its scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) is presented along with projection-based approaches. However, such methods face two major problems, i.e., task discrepancy between pre-training (image $\leftrightarrow$ text) and inference (image+text $\rightarrow$ image), and modality discrepancy. The latter pertains to approaches based on text-only projection training due to the necessity of feature extraction from the reference image during inference. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework to tackle both discrepancies. First, to ensure efficiency and scalability, a textual inversion network is pre-trained on large-scale caption datasets. Subsequently, we put forward Modality-Task Dual Alignment (MoTaDual) as the second stage, where large-language models (LLMs) generate triplet data for fine-tuning, and additionally, prompt learning is introduced in a multi-modal context to effectively alleviate both modality and task discrepancies. The experimental results show that our MoTaDual achieves the state-of-the-art performance across four widely used ZS-CIR benchmarks, while maintaining low training time and computational cost. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

How similar are images to each other for neural networks? Despite the overwhelming success of deep learning methods key questions about their internal workings still remain largely unanswered, due to their internal high dimensionality and complexity. To address this, one approach is to measure the similarity of activation responses to various inputs. Representational Similarity Matrices (RSMs) distill this similarity into scalar values for each input pair. These matrices encapsulate the entire similarity structure of a system, indicating which input leads to similar responses. While the similarity between images is ambiguous, we argue that the spatial location of semantic objects does neither influence human perception nor deep learning classifiers. Thus this should be reflected in the definition of similarity between image responses for computer vision systems. Revisiting the established similarity calculations for RSMs we expose their sensitivity to spatial alignment. In this paper, we propose to solve this through semantic RSMs, which are invariant to spatial permutation. We measure semantic similarity between input responses by formulating it as a set-matching problem. Further, we quantify the superiority of semantic RSMs over spatio-semantic RSMs through image retrieval and by comparing the similarity between representations to the similarity between predicted class probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2024</p></details> | None |

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is one approach to address these challenges, while multimodal models are emerging as promising AI assistants for processing both text and images. In this paper we describe a series of experiments aimed at determining how to best integrate multimodal models into RAG systems for the industrial domain. The purpose of the experiments is to determine whether including images alongside text from documents within the industrial domain increases RAG performance and to find the optimal configuration for such a multimodal RAG system. Our experiments include two approaches for image processing and retrieval, as well as two LLMs (GPT4-Vision and LLaVA) for answer synthesis. These image processing strategies involve the use of multimodal embeddings and the generation of textual summaries from images. We evaluate our experiments with an LLM-as-a-Judge approach. Our results reveal that multimodal RAG can outperform single-modality RAG settings, although image retrieval poses a greater challenge than text retrieval. Additionally, leveraging textual summaries from images presents a more promising approach compared to the use of multimodal embeddings, providing more opportunities for future advancements.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Unified Debiasing Approach for Vision-Language Models across Modalities and Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07593v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled complex multimodal tasks by processing text and image data simultaneously, significantly enhancing the field of artificial intelligence. However, these models often exhibit biases that can skew outputs towards societal stereotypes, thus necessitating debiasing strategies. Existing debiasing methods focus narrowly on specific modalities or tasks, and require extensive retraining. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Selective Feature Imputation for Debiasing (SFID), a novel methodology that integrates feature pruning and low confidence imputation (LCI) to effectively reduce biases in VLMs. SFID is versatile, maintaining the semantic integrity of outputs and costly effective by eliminating the need for retraining. Our experimental results demonstrate SFID's effectiveness across various VLMs tasks including zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, image captioning, and text-to-image generation, by significantly reducing gender biases without compromising performance. This approach not only enhances the fairness of VLMs applications but also preserves their efficiency and utility across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 (Spotlight), the Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</p></details> | None |
| **[Knowledge-aware Text-Image Retrieval for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03373v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based retrieval in large Earth observation archives is challenging because one needs to navigate across thousands of candidate matches only with the query image as a guide. By using text as information supporting the visual query, the retrieval system gains in usability, but at the same time faces difficulties due to the diversity of visual signals that cannot be summarized by a short caption only. For this reason, as a matching-based task, cross-modal text-image retrieval often suffers from information asymmetry between texts and images. To address this challenge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Text-Image Retrieval (KTIR) method for remote sensing images. By mining relevant information from an external knowledge graph, KTIR enriches the text scope available in the search query and alleviates the information gaps between texts and images for better matching. Moreover, by integrating domain-specific knowledge, KTIR also enhances the adaptation of pre-trained vision-language models to remote sensing applications. Experimental results on three commonly used remote sensing text-image retrieval benchmarks show that the proposed knowledge-aware method leads to varied and consistent retrievals, outperforming state-of-the-art retrieval methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TGRS</p></details> | None |

The objective is to search for images based on interactive conversations between humans and computers. To advance this task, we curate a dataset called ChatSearch. This dataset includes a multi-round multimodal conversational context query for each target image, thereby requiring the retrieval system to find the accurate image from database. Simultaneously, we propose a generative retrieval model named ChatSearcher, which is trained end-to-end to accept/produce interleaved image-text inputs/outputs. ChatSearcher exhibits strong capability in reasoning with multimodal context and can leverage world knowledge to yield visual retrieval results. It demonstrates superior performance on the ChatSearch dataset and also achieves competitive results on other image retrieval tasks and visual conversation tasks. We anticipate that this work will inspire further research on interactive multimodal retrieval systems.

| **[Denoise-I2W: Mapping Images to Denoising Words for Accurate Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17393v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) supports diverse tasks with a broad range of visual content manipulation intentions that can be related to domain, scene, object, and attribute. A key challenge for ZS-CIR is to accurately map image representation to a pseudo-word token that captures the manipulation intention relevant image information for generalized CIR. However, existing methods between the retrieval and pre-training stages lead to significant redundancy in the pseudo-word tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising image-to-word mapping approach, named Denoise-I2W, for mapping images into denoising pseudo-word tokens that, without intention-irrelevant visual information, enhance accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a pseudo triplet construction module first automatically constructs pseudo triples (\textit{i.e.,} a pseudo-reference image, a pseudo-manipulation text, and a target image) for pre-training the denoising mapping network. Then, a pseudo-composed mapping module maps the pseudo-reference image to a pseudo-word token and combines it with the pseudo-manipulation text with manipulation intention. This combination aligns with the target image, facilitating denoising intention-irrelevant visual information for mapping. Our proposed Denoise-I2W is a model-agnostic and annotation-free approach. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across three state-of-the-art ZS-CIR models on four benchmark datasets. By integrating Denoise-I2W with existing best models, we obtain consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.45\% to 4.17\% over the best methods without increasing inference costs. and achieve new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

These components, such as attention heads and MLPs, have been shown to capture distinct image features like shape, color or texture. However, understanding the role of these components in arbitrary vision transformers (ViTs) is challenging. To this end, we introduce a general framework which can identify the roles of various components in ViTs beyond CLIP. Specifically, we (a) automate the decomposition of the final representation into contributions from different model components, and (b) linearly map these contributions to CLIP space to interpret them via text. Additionally, we introduce a novel scoring function to rank components by their importance with respect to specific features. Applying our framework to various ViT variants (e.g. DeiT, DINO, DINOv2, Swin, MaxViT), we gain insights into the roles of different components concerning particular image features. These insights facilitate applications such as image retrieval using text descriptions or reference images, visualizing token importance heatmaps, and mitigating spurious correlations.

Existing methods frequently utilize simple cosine or complex distance metrics to transform the pairwise features into a similarity score, which suffers from an inadequate or inefficient capability for distance measurements. Consequently, we propose a Generalized Structural Sparse Function to dynamically capture thorough and powerful relationships across modalities for pair-wise similarity learning while remaining concise but efficient. Specifically, the distance metric delicately encapsulates two formats of diagonal and block-diagonal terms, automatically distinguishing and highlighting the cross-channel relevancy and dependency inside a structured and organized topology. Hence, it thereby empowers itself to adapt to the optimal matching patterns between the paired features and reaches a sweet spot between model complexity and capability. Extensive experiments on cross-modal and two extra uni-modal retrieval tasks (image-text retrieval, person re-identification, fine-grained image retrieval) have validated its superiority and flexibility over various popular retrieval frameworks. More importantly, we further discover that it can be seamlessly incorporated into multiple application scenarios, and demonstrates promising prospects from Attention Mechanism to Knowledge Distillation in a plug-and-play manner.

Recent computer vision advances have introduced similar capabilities for visual materials, with deep learning-based embeddings showing promise for analysing visual heritage. Given that many books feature visuals in addition to text, taking advantage of these breakthroughs is critical to making library collections open and accessible. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept image search application for exploring images in the National Library of Norway's pre-1900 books, comparing Vision Transformer (ViT), Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), and Sigmoid loss for Language-Image Pre-training (SigLIP) embeddings for image retrieval and classification. Our results show that the application performs well for exact image retrieval, with SigLIP embeddings slightly outperforming CLIP and ViT in both retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally, SigLIP-based image classification can aid in cleaning image datasets from a digitisation pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, Accepted to the 2024 Computational Humanities Research Conference (CHR)</p></details> | None |

Despite the varying significance of different textual elements within a sentence depending on the context, efforts to account for variation of importance in constructing text embeddings have been lacking. We propose a framework of Semantic Token Reweighting to build Interpretable text embeddings (SToRI), which incorporates controllability as well. SToRI refines the text encoding process in CLIP by differentially weighting semantic elements based on contextual importance, enabling finer control over emphasis responsive to data-driven insights and user preferences. The efficacy of SToRI is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on few-shot image classification and image retrieval tailored to user preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> | None |

However, collecting data by humans is not only very time-consuming but also expensive. Therefore, many scientists have devised various methods to collect data using computers. Among them, there is a method called web crawling, but the authors found that the crawling method has a problem in that unintended data is collected along with the user. The authors found that this can be filtered using the object recognition model YOLOv10. However, there are cases where data that is not properly filtered remains. Here, image reclassification was performed by additionally utilizing the distance output from the Siamese network, and higher performance was recorded than other classification models. (average \_f1 score YOLO+MobileNet 0.678->YOLO+SiameseNet 0.772)) The user can specify a distance threshold to adjust the balance between data deficiency and noise-robustness. The authors also found that the Siamese network can achieve higher performance with fewer resources because the cropped images are used for object recognition when processing images in the Siamese network. (Class 20 mean-based f1 score, non-crop+Siamese(MobileNetV3-Small) 80.94 -> crop preprocessing+Siamese(MobileNetV3-Small) 82.31) In this way, the image retrieval system that utilizes two consecutive models to reduce errors can save users' time and effort, and build better quality data faster and with fewer resources than before.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

This paper presents LoGS, a vision-based localization pipeline utilizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) technique as scene representation. This novel representation allows high-quality novel view synthesis. During the mapping phase, structure-from-motion (SfM) is applied first, followed by the generation of a GS map. During localization, the initial position is obtained through image retrieval, local feature matching coupled with a PnP solver, and then a high-precision pose is achieved through the analysis-by-synthesis manner on the GS map. Experimental results on four large-scale datasets demonstrate the proposed approach's SoTA accuracy in estimating camera poses and robustness under challenging few-shot conditions.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence generated content, particularly in technologies like large language models for text generation and diffusion models for visual generation, have sparked widespread research interest in applying these multimodal models in the fashion domain. However, tasks involving embeddings, such as image-to-text or text-to-image retrieval, have been largely overlooked from this perspective due to the diverse nature of the multimodal fashion domain. And current research on multi-task single models lack focus on image generation. In this work, we present UniFashion, a unified framework that simultaneously tackles the challenges of multimodal generation and retrieval tasks within the fashion domain, integrating image generation with retrieval tasks and text generation tasks. UniFashion unifies embedding and generative tasks by integrating a diffusion model and LLM, enabling controllable and high-fidelity generation. Our model significantly outperforms previous single-task state-of-the-art models across diverse fashion tasks, and can be readily adapted to manage complex vision-language tasks. This work demonstrates the potential learning synergy between multimodal generation and retrieval, offering a promising direction for future research in the fashion domain.

However, they usually suffer from considerable performance degradation when applied to different camera systems. In recent years, many Domain Adaptation Person ReID methods have been proposed, achieving impressive performance without requiring labeled data from the target domain. However, these approaches still need the unlabeled data of the target domain during the training process, making them impractical in many real-world scenarios. Our work focuses on the more practical Domain Generalized Person Re-identification (DG-ReID) problem. Given one or more source domains, it aims to learn a generalized model that can be applied to unseen target domains. One promising research direction in DG-ReID is the use of implicit deep semantic feature expansion, and our previous method, Domain Embedding Expansion (DEX), is one such example that achieves powerful results in DG-ReID. However, in this work we show that DEX and other similar implicit deep semantic feature expansion methods, due to limitations in their proposed loss function, fail to reach their full potential on large evaluation benchmarks as they have a tendency to saturate too early. Leveraging on this analysis, we propose Unified Deep Semantic Expansion, our novel framework that unifies implicit and explicit semantic feature expansion techniques in a single framework to mitigate this early over-fitting and achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in all DG-ReID benchmarks. Further, we apply our method on more general image retrieval tasks, also surpassing the current SOTA in all of these benchmarks by wide margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuro...</summary><p>Neurocomputing Volume 600, 1 October 2024, 128120. 15 pages</p></details> | None |

MedImageInsight is trained on medical images with associated text and labels across a diverse collection of domains, including X-Ray, CT, MRI, dermoscopy, OCT, fundus photography, ultrasound, histopathology, and mammography. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate MedImageInsight's ability to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) or human expert level performance across classification, image-image search, and fine-tuning tasks. Specifically, on public datasets, MedImageInsight achieves SOTA in CT 3D medical image retrieval, as well as SOTA in disease classification and search for chest X-ray, dermatology, and OCT imaging. Furthermore, MedImageInsight achieves human expert performance in bone age estimation (on both public and partner data), as well as AUC above 0.9 in most other domains. When paired with a text decoder, MedImageInsight achieves near SOTA level single image report findings generation with less than 10\% the parameters of other models. Compared to fine-tuning GPT-4o with only MIMIC-CXR data for the same task, MedImageInsight outperforms in clinical metrics, but underperforms on lexical metrics where GPT-4o sets a new SOTA. Importantly for regulatory purposes, MedImageInsight can generate ROC curves, adjust sensitivity and specificity based on clinical need, and provide evidence-based decision support through image-image search (which can also enable retrieval augmented generation). In an independent clinical evaluation of image-image search in chest X-ray, MedImageInsight outperformed every other publicly available foundation model evaluated by large margins (over 6 points AUC), and significantly outperformed other models in terms of AI fairness (across age and gender). We hope releasing MedImageInsight will help enhance collective progress in medical imaging AI research and development.</p></details> |  | None |

GSLoc backpropagates pose gradients over the rendering pipeline to align the rendered and target images, while it adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy by utilizing blurring kernels to mitigate the non-convexity of the problem and improve the convergence. The results show that our approach succeeds at visual localization in challenging conditions of relatively small overlap between initial and target frames inside textureless environments when state-of-the-art neural sparse methods provide inferior results. Using the byproduct of realistic rendering from the 3DGS map representation, we show how to enhance localization results by mixing a set of observed and virtual reference keyframes when solving the image retrieval problem. We evaluate our method both on synthetic and real-world data, discussing its advantages and application potential.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their success, VLMs face significant challenges with tasks involving geometric reasoning, algebraic problem-solving, and counting. These limitations stem from difficulties effectively integrating multiple modalities and accurately interpreting geometry-related tasks. Various works claim that introducing a captioning pipeline before VQA tasks enhances performance. We incorporated this pipeline for tasks involving geometry, algebra, and counting. We found that captioning results are not generalizable, specifically with larger VLMs primarily trained on downstream QnA tasks showing random performance on math-related challenges. However, we present a promising alternative: task-based prompting, enriching the prompt with task-specific guidance. This approach shows promise and proves more effective than direct captioning methods for math-heavy problems.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional approaches focus on visual image features and rely heavily on supervised learning with labeled data and cross-domain correspondences, which leads to an often struggle with the significant domain gap. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised approach to CDIR that incorporates textual context by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models. Our method, dubbed as Caption-Matching (CM), uses generated image captions as a domain-agnostic intermediate representation, enabling effective cross-domain similarity computation without the need for labeled data or fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on standard CDIR benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised settings with improvements of 24.0% on Office-Home and 132.2% on DomainNet over previous methods.

Furthermore, those metrics enable tasks such as image retrieval, object recognition and quality assessment, essential in fields like healthcare, astronomy and surveillance. Existing metrics, such as PSNR, MSE, SSIM, ISSM and FSIM, often face limitations in terms of either speed, complexity or sensitivity to small changes in images. To address these challenges, a novel image similarity metric, namely CSIM, that combines real-time while being sensitive to subtle image variations is investigated in this paper. The novel metric uses Gaussian Copula from probability theory to transform an image into vectors of pixel distribution associated to local image patches. These vectors contain, in addition to intensities and pixel positions, information on the dependencies between pixel values, capturing the structural relationships within the image. By leveraging the properties of Copulas, CSIM effectively models the joint distribution of pixel intensities, enabling a more nuanced comparison of image patches making it more sensitive to local changes compared to other metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that CSIM outperforms existing similarity metrics in various image distortion scenarios, including noise, compression artifacts and blur. The metric's ability to detect subtle differences makes it suitable for applications requiring high precision, such as medical imaging, where the detection of minor anomalies can be of a high importance.

Representation learning has been applied to various tasks, such as image generation and retrieval. The logical controllability of representations is important for these tasks. Although some methods have been shown to enable the intuitive control of representations using natural languages as the inputs, representation control via logic operations between representations has not been demonstrated. Some SSL methods using representation synthesis (e.g., elementwise mean and maximum operations) have been proposed, but the operations performed in these methods do not incorporate logic operations. In this work, we propose a logic-operable self-supervised representation learning method by replacing the existing representation synthesis with the OR operation on the probabilistic extension of many-valued logic. The representations comprise a set of feature-possession degrees, which are truth values indicating the presence or absence of each feature in the image, and realize the logic operations (e.g., OR and AND). Our method can generate a representation that has the features of both representations or only those features common to both representations. In addition, the expression of the ambiguous presence of a feature is realized by indicating the feature-possession degree by the probability distribution of truth values of the many-valued logic. We showed that our method performs competitively in single and multi-label classification tasks compared with prior SSL methods using synthetic representations. Moreover, experiments on image retrieval using MNIST and PascalVOC showed that the representations of our method can be operated by OR and AND operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing (ICIP2024 track)</p></details> | None |

Recent studies have recognized that the existence of adversarial examples poses a security threat to deep hashing models, that is, adversarial vulnerability. Notably, it is challenging to efficiently distill reliable semantic representatives for deep hashing to guide adversarial learning, and thereby it hinders the enhancement of adversarial robustness of deep hashing-based retrieval models. Moreover, current researches on adversarial training for deep hashing are hard to be formalized into a unified minimax structure. In this paper, we explore Semantic-Aware Adversarial Training (SAAT) for improving the adversarial robustness of deep hashing models. Specifically, we conceive a discriminative mainstay features learning (DMFL) scheme to construct semantic representatives for guiding adversarial learning in deep hashing. Particularly, our DMFL with the strict theoretical guarantee is adaptively optimized in a discriminative learning manner, where both discriminative and semantic properties are jointly considered. Moreover, adversarial examples are fabricated by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash codes of adversarial samples and mainstay features, the efficacy of which is validated in the adversarial attack trials. Further, we, for the first time, formulate the formalized adversarial training of deep hashing into a unified minimax optimization under the guidance of the generated mainstay codes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show superb attack performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms, meanwhile, the proposed adversarial training can effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations for trustworthy deep hashing-based retrieval.

Existing sketch segmentation methods treat sketches as bitmap images, leading to the loss of temporal order among strokes due to the shift from vector to image format. Moreover, these methods struggle to segment objects from categories absent in the training data. In this paper, we propose a Class-Agnostic Visio-Temporal Network (CAVT) for scene sketch semantic segmentation. CAVT employs a class-agnostic object detector to detect individual objects in a scene and groups the strokes of instances through its post-processing module. This is the first approach that performs segmentation at both the instance and stroke levels within scene sketches. Furthermore, there is a lack of free-hand scene sketch datasets with both instance and stroke-level class annotations. To fill this gap, we collected the largest Free-hand Instance- and Stroke-level Scene Sketch Dataset (FrISS) that contains 1K scene sketches and covers 403 object classes with dense annotations. Extensive experiments on FrISS and other datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art scene sketch segmentation models. The code and dataset will be made public after acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, we introduce a new practical CL setting tailored for open-world visual representation learning. In this setting, subsequent data streams systematically introduce novel classes that are disjoint from those seen in previous training phases, while also remaining distinct from the unseen test classes. In response, we present Dynamic Prompt and Representation Learner (DPaRL), a simple yet effective Prompt-based CL (PCL) method. Our DPaRL learns to generate dynamic prompts for inference, as opposed to relying on a static prompt pool in previous PCL methods. In addition, DPaRL jointly learns dynamic prompt generation and discriminative representation at each training stage whereas prior PCL methods only refine the prompt learning throughout the process. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on well-established open-world image retrieval benchmarks by an average of 4.7% improvement in Recall@1 performance.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | None |
| **[VLAD-BuFF: Burst-aware Fast Feature Aggregation for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19293v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial component of many visual localization pipelines for embodied agents. VPR is often formulated as an image retrieval task aimed at jointly learning local features and an aggregation method. The current state-of-the-art VPR methods rely on VLAD aggregation, which can be trained to learn a weighted contribution of features through their soft assignment to cluster centers. However, this process has two key limitations. Firstly, the feature-to-cluster weighting does not account for over-represented repetitive structures within a cluster, e.g., shadows or window panes; this phenomenon is also referred to as the `burstiness' problem, classically solved by discounting repetitive features before aggregation. Secondly, feature to cluster comparisons are compute-intensive for state-of-the-art image encoders with high-dimensional local features. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing VLAD-BuFF with two novel contributions: i) a self-similarity based feature discounting mechanism to learn Burst-aware features within end-to-end VPR training, and ii) Fast Feature aggregation by reducing local feature dimensions specifically through PCA-initialized learnable pre-projection. We benchmark our method on 9 public datasets, where VLAD-BuFF sets a new state of the art. Our method is able to maintain its high recall even for 12x reduced local feature dimensions, thus enabling fast feature aggregation without compromising on recall. Through additional qualitative studies, we show how our proposed weighting method effectively downweights the non-distinctive features.

The traditional solution for SfM consists of a complex pipeline of minimal solvers which tends to propagate errors and fails when images do not sufficiently overlap, have too little motion, etc. Recent methods have attempted to revisit this paradigm, but we empirically show that they fall short of fixing these core issues. In this paper, we propose instead to build upon a recently released foundation model for 3D vision that can robustly produce local 3D reconstructions and accurate matches. We introduce a low-memory approach to accurately align these local reconstructions in a global coordinate system. We further show that such foundation models can serve as efficient image retrievers without any overhead, reducing the overall complexity from quadratic to linear. Overall, our novel SfM pipeline is simple, scalable, fast and truly unconstrained, i.e. it can handle any collection of images, ordered or not. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our method provides steady performance across diverse settings, especially outperforming existing methods in small- and medium-scale settings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the ultimate decision regarding the diagnosis is made by the medical professional, drawing upon their accumulated experience. In this context, we believe that artificial intelligence can play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges in medical diagnosis not by making the final decision but by assisting in the diagnosis process with the most relevant information. The CBIR methods use similarity metrics to compare feature vectors generated from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In addition to the information contained in medical images, clinical data about the patient is often available and is also relevant in the final decision-making process by medical professionals. In this paper, we propose a novel method named CBIDR, which leverage both medical images and clinical data of patient, combining them through the ranking algorithm TOPSIS. The goal is to aid medical professionals in their final diagnosis by retrieving images and clinical data of patient that are most similar to query data from the database. As a case study, we illustrate our CBIDR for diagnostic of oral cancer including histopathological images and clinical data of patient. Experimental results in terms of accuracy achieved 97.44% in Top-1 and 100% in Top-5 showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 28 pages | None |
| **[Recursive Distillation for Open-Set Distributed Robot Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15897v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A typical assumption in state-of-the-art self-localization models is that an annotated training dataset is available for the target workspace. However, this is not necessarily true when a robot travels around the general open world. This work introduces a novel training scheme for open-world distributed robot systems. In our scheme, a robot (``student") can ask the other robots it meets at unfamiliar places (``teachers") for guidance. Specifically, a pseudo-training dataset is reconstructed from the teacher model and then used for continual learning of the student model under domain, class, and vocabulary incremental setup. Unlike typical knowledge transfer schemes, our scheme introduces only minimal assumptions on the teacher model, so that it can handle various types of open-set teachers, including those uncooperative, untrainable (e.g., image retrieval engines), or black-box teachers (i.e., data privacy). In this paper, we investigate a ranking function as an instance of such generic models, using a challenging data-free recursive distillation scenario, where a student once trained can recursively join the next-generation open teacher set.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, technical report</p></details> | None |

SearchDet retrieves a set of positive and negative images of an object to ground, embeds these images, and computes an input image-weighted query which is used to detect the desired concept in the image. Our proposed method is simple and training-free, yet achieves over 48.7% mAP improvement on ODinW and 59.1% mAP improvement on LVIS compared to state-of-the-art models such as GroundingDINO. We further show that our approach of basing object detection on a set of Web-retrieved exemplars is stable with respect to variations in the exemplars, suggesting a path towards eliminating costly data annotation and training procedures.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fashion Image-to-Image Translation for Complementary Item Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09847v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for online fashion retail has boosted research in fashion compatibility modeling and item retrieval, focusing on matching user queries (textual descriptions or reference images) with compatible fashion items. A key challenge is top-bottom retrieval, where precise compatibility modeling is essential. Traditional methods, often based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), have shown limited performance. Recent efforts have explored using generative models in compatibility modeling and item retrieval, where generated images serve as additional inputs. However, these approaches often overlook the quality of generated images, which could be crucial for model performance. Additionally, generative models typically require large datasets, posing challenges when such data is scarce. To address these issues, we introduce the Generative Compatibility Model (GeCo), a two-stage approach that improves fashion image retrieval through paired image-to-image translation. First, the Complementary Item Generation Model (CIGM), built on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), generates target item images (e.g., bottoms) from seed items (e.g., tops), offering conditioning signals for retrieval. These generated samples are then integrated into GeCo, enhancing compatibility modeling and retrieval accuracy. Evaluations on three datasets show that GeCo outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Key contributions include: (i) the GeCo model utilizing paired image-to-image translation within the Composed Image Retrieval framework, (ii) comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, and (iii) the release of a new Fashion Taobao dataset designed for top-bottom retrieval, promoting further research.</p></details> |  | None |

However, metric learning cannot handle differences in users' preferences, and requires data to train an image encoder. To overcome these limitations, we revisit relevance feedback, a classic technique for interactive retrieval systems, and propose an interactive CLIP-based image retrieval system with relevance feedback. Our retrieval system first executes the retrieval, collects each user's unique preferences through binary feedback, and returns images the user prefers. Even when users have various preferences, our retrieval system learns each user's preference through the feedback and adapts to the preference. Moreover, our retrieval system leverages CLIP's zero-shot transferability and achieves high accuracy without training. We empirically show that our retrieval system competes well with state-of-the-art metric learning in category-based image retrieval, despite not training image encoders specifically for each dataset. Furthermore, we set up two additional experimental settings where users have various preferences: one-label-based image retrieval and conditioned image retrieval. In both cases, our retrieval system effectively adapts to each user's preferences, resulting in improved accuracy compared to image retrieval without feedback. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of integrating CLIP with classic relevance feedback techniques to enhance image retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024 Workshops: 2nd Workshop on Traditional Computer Vision in the Age of Deep Learning (TradiCV)</p></details> | None |

This study aims to overcome these limitations by developing a computationally efficient training framework for a universal feature extractor that provides strong semantic image representations across various domains. To this end, we curated a multi-domain training dataset, called M4D-35k, which allows for resource-efficient training. Additionally, we conduct an extensive evaluation and comparison of various state-of-the-art visual-semantic foundation models and margin-based metric learning loss functions regarding their suitability for efficient universal feature extraction. Despite constrained computational resources, we achieve near state-of-the-art results on the Google Universal Image Embedding Challenge, with a mMP@5 of 0.721. This places our method at the second rank on the leaderboard, just 0.7 percentage points behind the best performing method. However, our model has 32% fewer overall parameters and 289 times fewer trainable parameters. Compared to methods with similar computational requirements, we outperform the previous state of the art by 3.3 percentage points.

As test data, we used diagnostic slides of TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas, consisting of 23 organs and 117 cancer subtypes. As a search platform we used Yottixel that enabled us to perform WSI search using patches.

We utilize speech-image contrastive (SIC) learning tasks to align speech and image representations at a coarse level and speech-image matching (SIM) learning tasks to further refine the fine-grained cross-modal alignment. SIC and SIM learning tasks are jointly trained in a unified manner. To optimize the learning process, we utilize an embedding queue that facilitates efficient sampling of high-quality and diverse negative representations during SIC learning. Additionally, it enhances the learning of SIM tasks by effectively mining hard negatives based on contrastive similarities calculated in SIC tasks. To further optimize learning under noisy supervision, we incorporate momentum distillation into the training process. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 4% in R@1 on two benchmark datasets for the speech-image retrieval tasks. Moreover, as observed in zero-shot experiments, our framework demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often model cross-modal interaction through simple cosine similarity of the global feature of each modality, which fall short in capturing fine-grained details within modalities. To address this issue, we introduce an effective framework and a novel learning task named cross-modal denoising (CMD) to enhance cross-modal interaction to achieve finer-level cross-modal alignment. Specifically, CMD is a denoising task designed to reconstruct semantic features from noisy features within one modality by interacting features from another modality. Notably, CMD operates exclusively during model training and can be removed during inference without adding extra inference time. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 2.0% in mean R@1 on the Flickr8k dataset and by 1.7% in mean R@1 on the SpokenCOCO dataset for the speech-image retrieval tasks, respectively.

Our method constitutes a two-stage process. First, we model REG as a text- and image-conditioned next-token prediction task. REs are autoregressively generated based on their preceding linguistic context and a visual representation of the referent. Second, we propose the use of discourse-aware comprehension guiding as part of a generate-and-rerank strategy through which candidate REs generated with our REG model are reranked based on their discourse-dependent discriminatory power. Results from our human evaluation indicate that our proposed two-stage approach is effective in producing discriminative REs, with higher performance in terms of text-image retrieval accuracy for reranked REs compared to those generated using greedy decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at INLG 2024</p></details> | None |

In contexts that rely on the intrinsic motivation of users, we seek to understand how the application design affects a user's willingness to contribute and the quantity and quality of the data they capture. In this project, we designed three versions of a camera-based mobile crowdsourcing application, which varied in the amount of labeling effort requested of the user and conducted a user study to evaluate the trade-off between the level of user-contributed information requested and the quantity and quality of labeled images collected. The results suggest that higher levels of user labeling do not lead to reduced contribution. Users collected and annotated the most images using the application version with the highest requested level of labeling with no decrease in user satisfaction. In preliminary experiments, the additional labeled data supported increased performance on an image retrieval task.</p></details> |  | None |

We explore a novel paradigm termed name-only continual learning where time and cost constraints prohibit manual annotation. In this scenario, learners adapt to new category shifts using only category names without the luxury of annotated training data. Our proposed solution leverages the expansive and ever-evolving internet to query and download uncurated webly-supervised data for image classification. We investigate the reliability of our web data and find them comparable, and in some cases superior, to manually annotated datasets. Additionally, we show that by harnessing the web, we can create support sets that surpass state-of-the-art name-only classification that create support sets using generative models or image retrieval from LAION-5B, achieving up to 25% boost in accuracy. When applied across varied continual learning contexts, our method consistently exhibits a small performance gap in comparison to models trained on manually annotated datasets. We present EvoTrends, a class-incremental dataset made from the web to capture real-world trends, created in just minutes. Overall, this paper underscores the potential of using uncurated webly-supervised data to mitigate the challenges associated with manual data labeling in continual learning.</p></details> |  | None |

In practice, application developers often fine-tune the embeddings to improve their accuracy on the dataset and query workload in hand. Existing approaches either fine-tune the pre-trained model itself or, more efficiently, but at the cost of accuracy, train adaptor models to transform the output of the pre-trained model. We present NUDGE, a family of novel non-parametric embedding fine-tuning approaches that are significantly more accurate and efficient than both sets of existing approaches. NUDGE directly modifies the embeddings of data records to maximize the accuracy of $k$-NN retrieval. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental study of NUDGE's non-parametric approach. We show that even though the underlying problem is NP-Hard, constrained variations can be solved efficiently. These constraints additionally ensure that the changes to the embeddings are modest, avoiding large distortions to the semantics learned during pre-training. In experiments across five pre-trained models and nine standard text and image retrieval datasets, NUDGE runs in minutes and often improves NDCG@10 by more than 10% over existing fine-tuning methods. On average, NUDGE provides 3.3x and 4.3x higher increase in accuracy and runs 200x and 3x faster, respectively, over fine-tuning the pre-trained model and training adaptors.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Optimizing CLIP Models for Image Retrieval with Maintained Joint-Embedding Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01936v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language and Image Pairing (CLIP), a transformative method in multimedia retrieval, typically trains two neural networks concurrently to generate joint embeddings for text and image pairs. However, when applied directly, these models often struggle to differentiate between visually distinct images that have similar captions, resulting in suboptimal performance for image-based similarity searches. This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing CLIP models for various image-based similarity search scenarios, while maintaining their effectiveness in text-based search tasks such as text-to-image retrieval and zero-shot classification. We propose and evaluate two novel methods aimed at refining the retrieval capabilities of CLIP without compromising the alignment between text and image embeddings. The first method involves a sequential fine-tuning process: initially optimizing the image encoder for more precise image retrieval and subsequently realigning the text encoder to these optimized image embeddings. The second approach integrates pseudo-captions during the retrieval-optimization phase to foster direct alignment within the embedding space. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that these methods enhance CLIP's performance on various benchmarks, including image retrieval, k-NN classification, and zero-shot text-based classification, while maintaining robustness in text-to-image retrieval. Our optimized models permit maintaining a single embedding per image, significantly simplifying the infrastructure needed for large-scale multi-modal similarity search systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Collaborative Group: Composed Image Retrieval via Consensus Learning from Noisy Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02092v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval extends content-based image retrieval systems by enabling users to search using reference images and captions that describe their intention. Despite great progress in developing image-text compositors to extract discriminative visual-linguistic features, we identify a hitherto overlooked issue, triplet ambiguity, which impedes robust feature extraction. Triplet ambiguity refers to a type of semantic ambiguity that arises between the reference image, the relative caption, and the target image. It is mainly due to the limited representation of the annotated text, resulting in many noisy triplets where multiple visually dissimilar candidate images can be matched to an identical reference pair (i.e., a reference image + a relative caption). To address this challenge, we propose the Consensus Network (Css-Net), inspired by the psychological concept that groups outperform individuals. Css-Net comprises two core components: (1) a consensus module with four diverse compositors, each generating distinct image-text embeddings, fostering complementary feature extraction and mitigating dependence on any single, potentially biased compositor; (2) a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss that encourages learning of inter-compositor interactions to promote consensual outputs. During evaluation, the decisions of the four compositors are combined through a weighting scheme, enhancing overall agreement. On benchmark datasets, particularly FashionIQ, Css-Net demonstrates marked improvements. Notably, it achieves significant recall gains, with a 2.77% increase in R@10 and 6.67% boost in R@50, underscoring its competitiveness in addressing the fundamental limitations of existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS)</p></details> | None |

However, they also have a massive number of parameters, resulting in enormous model sizes, thus making them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constraint devices. Block-wise generation can be a promising alternative for designing compact-sized (parameter-efficient) deep generative models since the model can generate one block at a time instead of generating the whole image at once. However, block-wise generation is also considerably challenging because ensuring coherence across generated blocks can be non-trivial. To this end, we design a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach and leverage the corresponding blocks of the images retrieved by the RAG module to condition the training and generation stages of a block-wise denoising diffusion model. Our conditioning schemes ensure coherence across the different blocks during training and, consequently, during generation. While we showcase our approach using the latent diffusion model (LDM) as the base model, it can be used with other variants of denoising diffusion models. We validate the solution of the coherence problem through the proposed approach by reporting substantive experiments to demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in compact model size and excellent generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, the accuracy and efficiency of image retrieval have significantly improved due to advancements in deep learning. However, existing methods still face numerous challenges, particularly in handling large-scale datasets, cross-domain retrieval, and image perturbations that can arise from real-world conditions such as variations in lighting, occlusion, and viewpoint. Data augmentation techniques and adversarial learning methods have been widely applied in the field of image retrieval to address these challenges. Data augmentation enhances the model's generalization ability and robustness by generating more diverse training samples, simulating real-world variations, and reducing overfitting. Meanwhile, adversarial attacks and defenses introduce perturbations during training to improve the model's robustness against potential attacks, ensuring reliability in practical applications. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest research advancements in image retrieval, with a particular focus on the roles of data augmentation and adversarial learning techniques in enhancing retrieval performance.

By expanding to sequential image fine-grained localization, our model, equipped with a novel Temporal Attention Module (TAM), leverages contextual information to significantly improve sequential image localization accuracy. Our method shows substantial reductions in both mean and median localization errors on the Cross-View Image Sequence (CVIS) dataset, outperforming current state-of-the-art single-image localization techniques. Additionally, by adapting the KITTI-CVL dataset into sequential image sets, we not only offer a more realistic dataset for future research but also demonstrate our model's robust generalization capabilities across varying times and areas, evidenced by a 75.3% reduction in mean distance error in cross-view sequential image localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Drone Referring Localization: An Efficient Heterogeneous Spatial Feature Interaction Method For UAV Self-Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06561v3)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image retrieval (IR) has emerged as a promising approach for self-localization in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, IR-based methods face several challenges: 1) Pre- and post-processing incur significant computational and storage overhead; 2) The lack of interaction between dual-source features impairs precise spatial perception. In this paper, we propose an efficient heterogeneous spatial feature interaction method, termed Drone Referring Localization (DRL), which aims to localize UAV-view images within satellite imagery. Unlike conventional methods that treat different data sources in isolation, followed by cosine similarity computations, DRL facilitates the learnable interaction of heterogeneous features. To implement the proposed DRL, we design two transformer-based frameworks, Post-Fusion and Mix-Fusion, enabling end-to-end training and inference. Furthermore, we introduce random scale cropping and weight balance loss techniques to augment paired data and optimize the balance between positive and negative sample weights. Additionally, we construct a new dataset, UL14, and establish a benchmark tailored to the DRL framework. Compared to traditional IR methods, DRL achieves superior localization accuracy (MA@20 +9.4\%) while significantly reducing computational time (1/7) and storage overhead (1/3). The dataset and code will be made publicly available. The dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/Dmmm1997/DRL} .</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/Dmmm1997/DRL) |

A handy tool that enables farmers to receive a diagnosis based on query pictures or the text description of suspicious plants is in high demand for initiating treatment before potential diseases spread further. In this paper, we develop a multimodal plant disease image retrieval system to support disease search based on either image or text prompts. Specifically, we utilize the largest in-the-wild plant disease dataset PlantWild, which includes over 18,000 images across 89 categories, to provide a comprehensive view of potential diseases relating to the query. Furthermore, cross-modal retrieval is achieved in the developed system, facilitated by a novel CLIP-based vision-language model that encodes both disease descriptions and disease images into the same latent space. Built on top of the retriever, our retrieval system allows users to upload either plant disease images or disease descriptions to retrieve the corresponding images with similar characteristics from the disease dataset to suggest candidate diseases for end users' consideration.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LowCLIP: Adapting the CLIP Model Architecture for Low-Resource Languages in Multimodal Image Retrieval Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13909v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research explores the development of multimodal vision-language models for image retrieval in low-resource languages, specifically Azerbaijani. Existing vision-language models primarily support high-resource languages, and fine-tuning them remains computationally demanding. To address challenges in vision-language retrieval for low-resource languages, we integrated the CLIP model architecture and employed several techniques to balance computational efficiency with performance. These techniques include synthetic data generation through machine translation, image augmentation, and further training the attention mechanisms of transformer-based models with domain-specific data. We integrated Multilingual BERT as a text encoder with image encoders like ResNet50, EfficientNet0, Vision Transformer (ViT), and Tiny Swin Transformer. Our study found that models like EfficientNet0 and Tiny Swin Transformer perform best on the datasets they were trained on, such as COCO, Flickr30k, and Flickr8k. Augmentation techniques boosted EfficientNet0 MAP on Flickr30k from 0.84 to 0.87 and ResNet50 MAP on MSCOCO from 0.70 to 0.80, contributing to a new state of the art in vision-language retrieval. We share our configurations and results to support further research.

| **[Self-supervised Photographic Image Layout Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03740v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of image layout representation learning, the critical process of translating image layouts into succinct vector forms is increasingly significant across diverse applications, such as image retrieval, manipulation, and generation. Most approaches in this area heavily rely on costly labeled datasets and notably lack in adapting their modeling and learning methods to the specific nuances of photographic image layouts. This shortfall makes the learning process for photographic image layouts suboptimal. In our research, we directly address these challenges. We innovate by defining basic layout primitives that encapsulate various levels of layout information and by mapping these, along with their interconnections, onto a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is meticulously engineered to capture the intricate layout information within the pixel domain explicitly. Advancing further, we introduce novel pretext tasks coupled with customized loss functions, strategically designed for effective self-supervised learning of these layout graphs. Building on this foundation, we develop an autoencoder-based network architecture skilled in compressing these heterogeneous layout graphs into precise, dimensionally-reduced layout representations. Additionally, we introduce the LODB dataset, which features a broader range of layout categories and richer semantics, serving as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of layout representation learning methods. Our extensive experimentation on this dataset demonstrates the superior performance of our approach in the realm of photographic image layout representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors of the paper believe that there is an error in the measurement of the F1 curve in the metrics description</p></details> | None |
| **[BrewCLIP: A Bifurcated Representation Learning Framework for Audio-Visual Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10383v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous methods for audio-image matching generally fall into one of two categories: pipeline models or End-to-End models. Pipeline models first transcribe speech and then encode the resulting text; End-to-End models encode speech directly. Generally, pipeline models outperform end-to-end models, but the intermediate transcription necessarily discards some potentially useful non-textual information. In addition to textual information, speech can convey details such as accent, mood, and and emphasis, which should be effectively captured in the encoded representation. In this paper, we investigate whether non-textual information, which is overlooked by pipeline-based models, can be leveraged to improve speech-image matching performance. We thoroughly analyze and compare End-to-End models, pipeline models, and our proposed dual-channel model for robust audio-image retrieval on a variety of datasets. Our approach achieves a substantial performance gain over the previous state-of-the-art by leveraging strong pretrained models, a prompting mechanism and a bifurcated design.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DM2RM: Dual-Mode Multimodal Ranking for Target Objects and Receptacles Based on Open-Vocabulary Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07910v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we aim to develop a domestic service robot (DSR) that, guided by open-vocabulary instructions, can carry everyday objects to the specified pieces of furniture. Few existing methods handle mobile manipulation tasks with open-vocabulary instructions in the image retrieval setting, and most do not identify both the target objects and the receptacles. We propose the Dual-Mode Multimodal Ranking model (DM2RM), which enables images of both the target objects and receptacles to be retrieved using a single model based on multimodal foundation models. We introduce a switching mechanism that leverages a mode token and phrase identification via a large language model to switch the embedding space based on the prediction target. To evaluate the DM2RM, we construct a novel dataset including real-world images collected from hundreds of building-scale environments and crowd-sourced instructions with referring expressions. The evaluation results show that the proposed DM2RM outperforms previous approaches in terms of standard metrics in image retrieval settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of the DM2RM on a standardized real-world DSR platform including fetch-and-carry actions, where it achieves a task success rate of 82% despite the zero-shot transfer setting.

Significant challenges arise due to the drastic appearance and geometry differences between views. In this paper, we propose a new approach for cross-view image geo-localization, i.e., the Panorama-BEV Co-Retrieval Network. Specifically, by utilizing the ground plane assumption and geometric relations, we convert street view panorama images into the BEV view, reducing the gap between street panoramas and satellite imagery. In the existing retrieval of street view panorama images and satellite images, we introduce BEV and satellite image retrieval branches for collaborative retrieval. By retaining the original street view retrieval branch, we overcome the limited perception range issue of BEV representation. Our network enables comprehensive perception of both the global layout and local details around the street view capture locations. Additionally, we introduce CVGlobal, a global cross-view dataset that is closer to real-world scenarios. This dataset adopts a more realistic setup, with street view directions not aligned with satellite images. CVGlobal also includes cross-regional, cross-temporal, and street view to map retrieval tests, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of algorithm performance. Our method excels in multiple tests on common cross-view datasets such as CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and our newly introduced CVGlobal, surpassing the current state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[Improving Composed Image Retrieval via Contrastive Learning with Scaling Positives and Negatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11317v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task aims to retrieve target images using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a modified text. Advanced methods often utilize contrastive learning as the optimization objective, which benefits from adequate positive and negative examples. However, the triplet for CIR incurs high manual annotation costs, resulting in limited positive examples. Furthermore, existing methods commonly use in-batch negative sampling, which reduces the negative number available for the model. To address the problem of lack of positives, we propose a data generation method by leveraging a multi-modal large language model to construct triplets for CIR. To introduce more negatives during fine-tuning, we design a two-stage fine-tuning framework for CIR, whose second stage introduces plenty of static representations of negatives to optimize the representation space rapidly. The above two improvements can be effectively stacked and designed to be plug-and-play, easily applied to existing CIR models without changing their original architectures. Extensive experiments and ablation analysis demonstrate that our method effectively scales positives and negatives and achieves state-of-the-art results on both FashionIQ and CIRR datasets. In addition, our method also performs well in zero-shot composed image retrieval, providing a new CIR solution for the low-resources scenario.

| **[AMES: Asymmetric and Memory-Efficient Similarity Estimation for Instance-level Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03282v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the problem of instance-level image retrieval re-ranking with the constraint of memory efficiency, ultimately aiming to limit memory usage to 1KB per image. Departing from the prevalent focus on performance enhancements, this work prioritizes the crucial trade-off between performance and memory requirements. The proposed model uses a transformer-based architecture designed to estimate image-to-image similarity by capturing interactions within and across images based on their local descriptors. A distinctive property of the model is the capability for asymmetric similarity estimation. Database images are represented with a smaller number of descriptors compared to query images, enabling performance improvements without increasing memory consumption. To ensure adaptability across different applications, a universal model is introduced that adjusts to a varying number of local descriptors during the testing phase. Results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both hand-crafted and learned models. In particular, compared with current state-of-the-art methods that overlook their memory footprint, our approach not only attains superior performance but does so with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

| **[Annotation Cost-Efficient Active Learning for Deep Metric Learning Driven Remote Sensing Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10107v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep metric learning (DML) has shown to be effective for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) in remote sensing (RS). Most of DML methods for CBIR rely on a high number of annotated images to accurately learn model parameters of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, gathering such data is time-consuming and costly. To address this, we propose an annotation cost-efficient active learning (ANNEAL) method tailored to DML-driven CBIR in RS. ANNEAL aims to create a small but informative training set made up of similar and dissimilar image pairs to be utilized for accurately learning a metric space. The informativeness of image pairs is evaluated by combining uncertainty and diversity criteria. To assess the uncertainty of image pairs, we introduce two algorithms: 1) metric-guided uncertainty estimation (MGUE); and 2) binary classifier guided uncertainty estimation (BCGUE). MGUE algorithm automatically estimates a threshold value that acts as a boundary between similar and dissimilar image pairs based on the distances in the metric space. The closer the similarity between image pairs is to the estimated threshold value the higher their uncertainty. BCGUE algorithm estimates the uncertainty of the image pairs based on the confidence of the classifier in assigning correct similarity labels. The diversity criterion is assessed through a clustering-based strategy. ANNEAL combines either MGUE or BCGUE algorithm with the clustering-based strategy to select the most informative image pairs, which are then labelled by expert annotators as similar or dissimilar. This way of annotating images significantly reduces the annotation cost compared to annotating images with land-use land-cover class labels. Experimental results on two RS benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code of this work is publicly available at \url{https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/anneal_tgrs}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS)</p></details> | None |
| **[On Validation of Search & Retrieval of Tissue Images in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01570v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical images play a crucial role in modern healthcare by providing vital information for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Fields such as radiology and pathology rely heavily on accurate image interpretation, with radiologists examining X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to diagnose conditions from fractures to cancer, while pathologists use microscopy and digital images to detect cellular abnormalities for diagnosing cancers and infections. The technological advancements have exponentially increased the volume and complexity of medical images, necessitating efficient tools for management and retrieval. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems address this need by searching and retrieving images based on visual content, enhancing diagnostic accuracy by allowing clinicians to find similar cases and compare pathological patterns. Comprehensive validation of image search engines in medical applications involves evaluating performance metrics like accuracy, indexing, and search times, and storage overhead, ensuring reliable and efficient retrieval of accurate results, as demonstrated by recent validations in histopathology.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lite-Mind: Towards Efficient and Robust Brain Representation Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03781v4)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limited data availability and the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI signals lead to the challenging task of fMRI-to-image retrieval. State-of-the-art MindEye remarkably improves fMRI-to-image retrieval performance by leveraging a large model, i.e., a 996M MLP Backbone per subject, to align fMRI embeddings to the final hidden layer of CLIP's Vision Transformer (ViT). However, significant individual variations exist among subjects, even under identical experimental setups, mandating the training of large subject-specific models. The substantial parameters pose significant challenges in deploying fMRI decoding on practical devices. To this end, we propose Lite-Mind, a lightweight, efficient, and robust brain representation learning paradigm based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which efficiently aligns fMRI voxels to fine-grained information of CLIP. We elaborately design a DFT backbone with Spectrum Compression and Frequency Projector modules to learn informative and robust voxel embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that Lite-Mind achieves an impressive 94.6% fMRI-to-image retrieval accuracy on the NSD dataset for Subject 1, with 98.7% fewer parameters than MindEye. Lite-Mind is also proven to be able to be migrated to smaller fMRI datasets and establishes a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot classification on the GOD dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, ACM MM 2024 Oral</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods cannot effectively employ deep learning techniques to match noisy and occluded crime-scene shoeprints to a shoe database due to a lack of training data. Moreover, all existing methods match crime-scene shoeprints to clean reference prints, yet our analysis shows matching to more informative tread depth maps yields better retrieval results. The matching task is further complicated by the necessity to identify similarities only in corresponding regions (heels, toes, etc) of prints and shoe treads. To overcome these challenges, we leverage shoe tread images from online retailers and utilize an off-the-shelf predictor to estimate depth maps and clean prints. Our method, named CriSp, matches crime-scene shoeprints to tread depth maps by training on this data. CriSp incorporates data augmentation to simulate crime-scene shoeprints, an encoder to learn spatially-aware features, and a masking module to ensure only visible regions of crime-scene prints affect retrieval results. To validate our approach, we introduce two validation sets by reprocessing existing datasets of crime-scene shoeprints and establish a benchmarking protocol for comparison. On this benchmark, CriSp significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both automated shoeprint matching and image retrieval tailored to this task.</p></details> |  | None |

The sequence-to-sequence architecture typically used for optical character recognition (OCR) - which jointly learns a vision and language model - is poorly extensible to low-resource document collections, as learning a language-vision model requires extensive labeled sequences and compute. This study models OCR as a character level image retrieval problem, using a contrastively trained vision encoder. Because the model only learns characters' visual features, it is more sample efficient and extensible than existing architectures, enabling accurate OCR in settings where existing solutions fail. Crucially, the model opens new avenues for community engagement in making digital history more representative of documentary history.</p></details> |  | None |

Our methodology, PlugIR, actively utilizes the general instruction-following capability of LLMs in two ways. First, by reformulating the dialogue-form context, we eliminate the necessity of fine-tuning a retrieval model on existing visual dialogue data, thereby enabling the use of any arbitrary black-box model. Second, we construct the LLM questioner to generate non-redundant questions about the attributes of the target image, based on the information of retrieval candidate images in the current context. This approach mitigates the issues of noisiness and redundancy in the generated questions. Beyond our methodology, we propose a novel evaluation metric, Best log Rank Integral (BRI), for a comprehensive assessment of the interactive retrieval system. PlugIR demonstrates superior performance compared to both zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines in various benchmarks. Additionally, the two methodologies comprising PlugIR can be flexibly applied together or separately in various situations.

| **[Revolutionizing Text-to-Image Retrieval as Autoregressive Token-to-Voken Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17274v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image retrieval is a fundamental task in multimedia processing, aiming to retrieve semantically relevant cross-modal content. Traditional studies have typically approached this task as a discriminative problem, matching the text and image via the cross-attention mechanism (one-tower framework) or in a common embedding space (two-tower framework). Recently, generative cross-modal retrieval has emerged as a new research line, which assigns images with unique string identifiers and generates the target identifier as the retrieval target. Despite its great potential, existing generative approaches are limited due to the following issues: insufficient visual information in identifiers, misalignment with high-level semantics, and learning gap towards the retrieval target. To address the above issues, we propose an autoregressive voken generation method, named AVG. AVG tokenizes images into vokens, i.e., visual tokens, and innovatively formulates the text-to-image retrieval task as a token-to-voken generation problem. AVG discretizes an image into a sequence of vokens as the identifier of the image, while maintaining the alignment with both the visual information and high-level semantics of the image. Additionally, to bridge the learning gap between generative training and the retrieval target, we incorporate discriminative training to modify the learning direction during token-to-voken training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVG achieves superior results in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | Work in progress | None |

In this paper, we present a novel methodology, reframing image retrieval as a variant of generative modeling and employing a sequence-to-sequence model. This approach is harmoniously aligned with the current trend towards unification in research, presenting a cohesive framework that allows for end-to-end differentiable searching. This, in turn, facilitates superior performance via direct optimization techniques. The development of our model, dubbed IRGen, addresses the critical technical challenge of converting an image into a concise sequence of semantic units, which is pivotal for enabling efficient and effective search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used image retrieval benchmarks as well as two million-scale datasets, yielding significant improvement compared to prior competitive retrieval methods. In addition, the notable surge in precision scores facilitated by generative modeling presents the potential to bypass the reranking phase, which is traditionally indispensable in practical retrieval workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |
