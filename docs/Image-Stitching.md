| **[Aerial Image Stitching Using IMU Data from a UAV](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06841v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for aerial photography and remote sensing applications. One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Depth-Supervised Fusion Network for Seamless-Free Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21396v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in the stitched results. To address this, we propose a depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against the existing methods.

| **[Stitch: Training-Free Position Control in Multimodal Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26644v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years, but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models. We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top models still have significant room for improvement in position-based generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206% on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while integrating position control into leading models training-free.

| **[A Generalization of CLAP from 3D Localization to Image Processing, A Connection With RANSAC & Hough Transforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13605v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In previous work, we introduced a 2D localization algorithm called CLAP, Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which was used during our championship win in RoboCup 2024, an international autonomous humanoid soccer competition. CLAP is particularly recognized for its robustness against outliers, where clustering is employed to suppress noise and mitigate against erroneous feature matches. This clustering-based strategy provides an alternative to traditional outlier rejection schemes such as RANSAC, in which candidates are validated by reprojection error across all data points. In this paper, CLAP is extended to a more general framework beyond 2D localization, specifically to 3D localization and image stitching. We also show how CLAP, RANSAC, and Hough transforms are related. The generalization of CLAP is widely applicable to many different fields and can be a useful tool to deal with noise and uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stitching the Story: Creating Panoramic Incident Summaries from Body-Worn Footage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04370v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[ArbiViewGen: Controllable Arbitrary Viewpoint Camera Data Generation for Autonomous Driving via Stable Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05236v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this, CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple vehicle configurations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Neural Field Representations of Mobile Computational Photography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05907v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays, and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.</p></details> | PhD thesis | None |

This device offers comparable speed to commercial digital pathology scanners, but at a significantly lower price point and smaller size/weight. Using BlurryScope, we implemented automated classification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) scores on motion-blurred images of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained breast tissue sections, achieving concordant results with those obtained from a high-end digital scanning microscope. Using a test set of 284 unique patient cores, we achieved testing accuracies of 79.3% and 89.7% for 4-class (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and 2-class (0/1+, 2+/3+) HER2 classification, respectively. BlurryScope automates the entire workflow, from image scanning to stitching and cropping, as well as HER2 score classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 Pa...</summary><p>22 Pages, 5 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> | None |
| **[Robust Image Stitching with Optimal Plane](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05903v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of \textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes. Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness.

| **[PIS3R: Very Large Parallax Image Stitching via Deep 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04236v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[(Almost) Free Modality Stitching of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10015v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module that aims to align the representation spaces of these uni-modal models towards a multi-modal objective. However, given the complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the cost of searching for the best performing uni-modal model pair by $10\times$, while matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.</p></details> | Pre-print | None |
| **[Hallucinating 360°: Panoramic Street-View Generation via Local Scenes Diffusion and Probabilistic Prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06971v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360° surround view in a single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models.

| **[Generative Panoramic Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07133v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting, camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiple Object Stitching for Unsupervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07364v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence, compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations. In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised representation performance on both single object centric images and multi-object ones.

| **[VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03614v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe." We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID: we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch}, \texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference. Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks.

| **[3D Reconstruction from Sketches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14621v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple sketches. We propose a pipeline which involves (1) stitching together multiple sketches through use of correspondence points, (2) converting the stitched sketch into a realistic image using a CycleGAN, and (3) estimating that image's depth-map using a pre-trained convolutional neural network based architecture called MegaDepth. Our contribution includes constructing a dataset of image-sketch pairs, the images for which are from the Zurich Building Database, and sketches have been generated by us. We use this dataset to train a CycleGAN for our pipeline's second step. We end up with a stitching process that does not generalize well to real drawings, but the rest of the pipeline that creates a 3D reconstruction from a single sketch performs quite well on a wide variety of drawings.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures, paper dated December 12, 2018</p></details> | None |
| **[IMITATE: Image Registration with Context for unknown time frame recovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10124v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we formulate a novel image registration formalism dedicated to the estimation of unknown condition-related images, based on two or more known images and their associated conditions. We show how to practically model this formalism by using a new conditional U-Net architecture, which fully takes into account the conditional information and does not need any fixed image. Our formalism is then applied to image moving tumors for radiotherapy treatment at different breathing amplitude using 4D-CT (3D+t) scans in thoracoabdominal regions. This driving application is particularly complex as it requires to stitch a collection of sequential 2D slices into several 3D volumes at different organ positions. Movement interpolation with standard methods then generates well known reconstruction artefacts in the assembled volumes due to irregular patient breathing, hysteresis and poor correlation of breathing signal to internal motion. Results obtained on 4D-CT clinical data showcase artefact-free volumes achieved through real-time latencies.

To address the lack of ground truth in current multi-modal image registration and fusion methods, we propose a novel self-supervised \textbf{B}i-directional \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{R}egistration framework (\textbf{B-SR}). Specifically, B-SR utilizes a proxy data generator (PDG) and an inverse proxy data generator (IPDG) to achieve self-supervised global-local registration. Visible-infrared image pairs with spatially misaligned differences are aligned to obtain global differences through the registration module. The same image pairs are processed by PDG, such as cropping, flipping, stitching, etc., and then aligned to obtain local differences. IPDG converts the obtained local differences into pseudo-global differences, which are used to perform global-local difference consistency with the global differences. Furthermore, aiming at eliminating the effect of modal gaps on the registration module, we design a neighborhood dynamic alignment loss to achieve cross-modal image edge alignment. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in multi-modal image alignment and fusion against the competing methods. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, StableMotion framework takes text-to-image Stable Diffusion (SD) models as backbone and repurposes it into an image-to-motion estimator. To mitigate inconsistent output produced by diffusion models, we propose Adaptive Ensemble Strategy (AES) that consolidates multiple outputs into a cohesive, high-fidelity result. Additionally, we present the concept of Sampling Steps Disaster (SSD), the counterintuitive scenario where increasing the number of sampling steps can lead to poorer outcomes, which enables our framework to achieve one-step inference. StableMotion is verified on two image rectification tasks and delivers state-of-the-art performance in both, as well as showing strong generalizability. Supported by SSD, StableMotion offers a speedup of 200 times compared to previous diffusion model-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[StabStitch++: Unsupervised Online Video Stitching with Spatiotemporal Bidirectional Warps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05001v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, which unveils the temporal content shakes induced by sequentially unsmooth warps when extending image stitching to video stitching. Even if the input videos are stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment, trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes. Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in this field by building a real-time online video stitching system.</p></details> | <details><summary>TPAMI...</summary><p>TPAMI2025; https://github.com/nie-lang/StabStitch2. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.06378</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/nie-lang/StabStitch2) |

Conventional Liquid-Based Cytology(LBC) is a labor-intensive process, requires expert pathologists and is highly prone to errors, highlighting the need for more efficient screening methods. This paper introduces an innovative approach that integrates low-cost biological microscopes with our simple and efficient AI algorithms for automated whole-slide analysis. Our system uses a motorized microscope to capture cytology images, which are then processed through an AI pipeline involving image stitching, cell segmentation, and classification. We utilize the lightweight UNet-based model involving human-in-the-loop approach to train our segmentation model with minimal ROIs. CvT-based classification model, trained on the SIPaKMeD dataset, accurately categorizes five cell types.

| **[You Need a Transition Plane: Bridging Continuous Panoramic 3D Reconstruction with Perspective Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09062v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, reconstructing scenes from a single panoramic image using advanced 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques has attracted growing interest. Panoramic images offer a 360$\times$ 180 field of view (FoV), capturing the entire scene in a single shot. However, panoramic images introduce severe distortion, making it challenging to render 3D Gaussians into 2D distorted equirectangular space directly. Converting equirectangular images to cubemap projections partially alleviates this problem but introduces new challenges, such as projection distortion and discontinuities across cube-face boundaries. To address these limitations, we present a novel framework, named TPGS, to bridge continuous panoramic 3D scene reconstruction with perspective Gaussian splatting. Firstly, we introduce a Transition Plane between adjacent cube faces to enable smoother transitions in splatting directions and mitigate optimization ambiguity in the boundary region. Moreover, an intra-to-inter face optimization strategy is proposed to enhance local details and restore visual consistency across cube-face boundaries. Specifically, we optimize 3D Gaussians within individual cube faces and then fine-tune them in the stitched panoramic space. Additionally, we introduce a spherical sampling technique to eliminate visible stitching seams. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor, egocentric, and roaming benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[AgRowStitch: A High-fidelity Image Stitching Pipeline for Ground-based Agricultural Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21990v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural imaging often requires individual images to be stitched together into a final mosaic for analysis. However, agricultural images can be particularly challenging to stitch because feature matching across images is difficult due to repeated textures, plants are non-planar, and mosaics built from many images can accumulate errors that cause drift. Although these issues can be mitigated by using georeferenced images or taking images at high altitude, there is no general solution for images taken close to the crop. To address this, we created a user-friendly and open source pipeline for stitching ground-based images of a linear row of crops that does not rely on additional data. First, we use SuperPoint and LightGlue to extract and match features within small batches of images. Then we stitch the images in each batch in series while imposing constraints on the camera movement. After straightening and rescaling each batch mosaic, all batch mosaics are stitched together in series and then straightened into a final mosaic. We tested the pipeline on images collected along 72 m long rows of crops using two different agricultural robots and a camera manually carried over the row. In all three cases, the pipeline produced high-quality mosaics that could be used to georeference real world positions with a mean absolute error of 20 cm. This approach provides accessible leaf-scale stitching to users who need to coarsely georeference positions within a row, but do not have access to accurate positional data or sophisticated imaging systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OmniSplat: Taming Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting for Omnidirectional Images with Editable Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16604v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feed-forward 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) models have gained significant popularity due to their ability to generate scenes immediately without needing per-scene optimization. Although omnidirectional images are becoming more popular since they reduce the computation required for image stitching to composite a holistic scene, existing feed-forward models are only designed for perspective images. The unique optical properties of omnidirectional images make it difficult for feature encoders to correctly understand the context of the image and make the Gaussian non-uniform in space, which hinders the image quality synthesized from novel views. We propose OmniSplat, a training-free fast feed-forward 3DGS generation framework for omnidirectional images. We adopt a Yin-Yang grid and decompose images based on it to reduce the domain gap between omnidirectional and perspective images. The Yin-Yang grid can use the existing CNN structure as it is, but its quasi-uniform characteristic allows the decomposed image to be similar to a perspective image, so it can exploit the strong prior knowledge of the learned feed-forward network. OmniSplat demonstrates higher reconstruction accuracy than existing feed-forward networks trained on perspective images.

The problem is usually addressed by sliding window inference, which can theoretically lead to seamlessly stitched predictions. However, in practice many of the popular pipelines still suffer from tiling artifacts. We investigate the root cause of these issues and show that they stem from the normalization layers within the neural networks. We propose indicators to detect normalization issues and further explore the trade-offs between artifact-free and high-quality predictions, using three diverse microscopy datasets as examples. Finally, we propose to use BatchRenorm as the most suitable normalization strategy, which effectively removes tiling artifacts and enhances transfer performance, thereby improving the reusability of trained networks for new datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work we address both of these challenges with a spherical neural light field model for implicit panoramic image stitching and re-rendering; able to accommodate for depth parallax, view-dependent lighting, and local scene motion and color changes during capture. Fit during test-time to an arbitrary path panoramic video capture -- vertical, horizontal, random-walk -- these neural light spheres jointly estimate the camera path and a high-resolution scene reconstruction to produce novel wide field-of-view projections of the environment. Our single-layer model avoids expensive volumetric sampling, and decomposes the scene into compact view-dependent ray offset and color components, with a total model size of 80 MB per scene, and real-time (50 FPS) rendering at 1080p resolution. We demonstrate improved reconstruction quality over traditional image stitching and radiance field methods, with significantly higher tolerance to scene motion and non-ideal capture settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project site: https://light.princeton.edu/publication/neuls/</p></details> | None |

However, existing collaborative perception systems are limited by inefficiencies in user interaction and the challenge of multi-camera photorealistic visualization. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ChatStitch, the first collaborative perception system capable of unveiling obscured blind spot information through natural language commands integrated with external digital assets. To adeptly handle complex or abstract commands, ChatStitch employs a multi-agent collaborative framework based on Large Language Models. For achieving the most intuitive perception for humans, ChatStitch proposes SV-UDIS, the first surround-view unsupervised deep image stitching method under the non-global-overlapping condition. We conducted extensive experiments on the UDIS-D, MCOV-SLAM open datasets, and our real-world dataset. Specifically, our SV-UDIS method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UDIS-D dataset for 3, 4, and 5 image stitching tasks, with PSNR improvements of 9%, 17%, and 21%, and SSIM improvements of 8%, 18%, and 26%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Bi-channel Aided Stitching of Atomic Force Microscopy Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08735v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopy is an essential tool in scientific research, enabling the visualization of structures at micro- and nanoscale resolutions. However, the field of microscopy often encounters limitations in field-of-view (FOV), restricting the amount of sample that can be imaged in a single capture. To overcome this limitation, image stitching techniques have been developed to seamlessly merge multiple overlapping images into a single, high-resolution composite. The images collected from microscope need to be optimally stitched before accurate physical information can be extracted from post analysis. However, the existing stitching tools either struggle to stitch images together when the microscopy images are feature sparse or cannot address all the transformations of images. To address these issues, we propose a bi-channel aided feature-based image stitching method and demonstrate its use on AFM generated biofilm images. The topographical channel image of AFM data captures the morphological details of the sample, and a stitched topographical image is desired for researchers. We utilize the amplitude channel of AFM data to maximize the matching features and to estimate the position of the original topographical images and show that the proposed bi-channel aided stitching method outperforms the traditional stitching approach. Furthermore, we found that the differentiation of the topographical images along the x-axis provides similar feature information to the amplitude channel image, which generalizes our approach when the amplitude images are not available. Here we demonstrated the application on AFM, but similar approaches could be employed of optical microscopy with brightfield and fluorescence channels. We believe this proposed workflow will benefit the experimentalist to avoid erroneous analysis and discovery due to incorrect stitching.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has 21 pages with 8 figures in main-text and 2 figures in Supplementary materials</p></details> | None |

To tackle this problem, we propose the Reference-Driven Inpainting Stitcher (RDIStitcher), which reformulates the image fusion and rectangling as a reference-based inpainting model, incorporating a larger modification fusion area and stronger modification intensity than previous methods. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised model training method, which enables the implementation of RDIStitcher without requiring labeled data by fine-tuning a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model. Recognizing difficulties in assessing the quality of stitched images, we present the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)-based metrics, offering a new perspective on evaluating stitched image quality. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances content coherence and seamless transitions in the stitched images. Especially in the zero-shot experiments, our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

| **[Continuous Patch Stitching for Block-wise Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16795v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most recently, learned image compression methods have outpaced traditional hand-crafted standard codecs. However, their inference typically requires to input the whole image at the cost of heavy computing resources, especially for high-resolution image compression; otherwise, the block artefact can exist when compressed by blocks within existing learned image compression methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel continuous patch stitching (CPS) framework for block-wise image compression that is able to achieve seamlessly patch stitching and mathematically eliminate block artefact, thus capable of significantly reducing the required computing resources when compressing images. More specifically, the proposed CPS framework is achieved by padding-free operations throughout, with a newly established parallel overlapping stitching strategy to provide a general upper bound for ensuring the continuity. Upon this, we further propose functional residual blocks with even-sized kernels to achieve down-sampling and up-sampling, together with bottleneck residual blocks retaining feature size to increase network depth. Experimental results demonstrate that our CPS framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance against existing baselines, whilst requiring less than half of computing resources of existing models. Our code shall be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 5 pages, 8 figures | None |

In recent years, the development of machine learning and deep learning has greatly bolstered the power of computational pathology. However, there still remains the issue of data scarcity and data imbalance, which can have an adversarial effect on any computational method. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and effective data augmentation strategy to generate new pathology images from the existing pathology images and thus enrich datasets without additional data collection or annotation costs. To evaluate the proposed method, we employed two sets of colorectal cancer datasets and obtained improved classification results, suggesting that the proposed simple approach holds the potential for alleviating the data scarcity and imbalance in computational pathology.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neural Augmentation Based Panoramic High Dynamic Range Stitching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04679v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to saturated regions of inputting low dynamic range (LDR) images and large intensity changes among the LDR images caused by different exposures, it is challenging to produce an information enriched panoramic LDR image without visual artifacts for a high dynamic range (HDR) scene through stitching multiple geometrically synchronized LDR images with different exposures and pairwise overlapping fields of views (OFOVs). Fortunately, the stitching of such images is innately a perfect scenario for the fusion of a physics-driven approach and a data-driven approach due to their OFOVs. Based on this new insight, a novel neural augmentation based panoramic HDR stitching algorithm is proposed in this paper. The physics-driven approach is built up using the OFOVs. Different exposed images of each view are initially generated by using the physics-driven approach, are then refined by a data-driven approach, and are finally used to produce panoramic LDR images with different exposures. All the panoramic LDR images with different exposures are combined together via a multi-scale exposure fusion algorithm to produce the final panoramic LDR image. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms existing panoramic stitching algorithms.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |

Inspired by the human creative process, we reformulate these tasks using a left-right stitching formulation to construct contextual input. Building upon this foundation, we propose AnyRefill, an extension of LeftRefill, that effectively adapts Text-to-Image (T2I) models to various vision tasks. AnyRefill leverages the inpainting priors of advanced T2I model based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, and incorporates flexible components to enhance its capabilities. By combining task-specific LoRAs with the stitching input, AnyRefill unlocks its potential across diverse tasks, including conditional generation, visual perception, and image editing, without requiring additional visual encoders. Meanwhile, AnyRefill exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring minimal task-specific fine-tuning while maintaining high generative performance. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that AnyRefill outperforms other image condition injection methods and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art open-source methods. Notably, AnyRefill delivers results comparable to advanced commercial tools, such as IC-Light and SeedEdit, even in challenging scenarios. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across versatile tasks validate the strong generation of the proposed simple yet effective LPG formulation, establishing AnyRefill as a unified, highly data-efficient solution for reference-based vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, submitted to TPAMI</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhanced Feature-based Image Stitching for Endoscopic Videos in Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04207v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video endoscopy represents a major advance in the investigation of gastrointestinal diseases. Reviewing endoscopy videos often involves frequent adjustments and reorientations to piece together a complete view, which can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. Image stitching techniques address this issue by providing a continuous and complete visualization of the examined area. However, endoscopic images, particularly those of the esophagus, present unique challenges. The smooth surface, lack of distinct feature points, and non-horizontal orientation complicate the stitching process, rendering traditional feature-based methods often ineffective for these types of images. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing pipeline designed to enhance endoscopic image stitching through advanced computational techniques. Our approach converts endoscopic video data into continuous 2D images by following four key steps: (1) keyframe selection, (2) image rotation adjustment to correct distortions, (3) surface unwrapping using polar coordinate transformation to generate a flat image, and (4) feature point matching enhanced by Adaptive Histogram Equalization for improved feature detection. We evaluate stitching quality through the assessment of valid feature point match pairs. Experiments conducted on 20 pediatric endoscopy videos demonstrate that our method significantly improves image alignment and stitching quality compared to traditional techniques, laying a robust foundation for more effective panoramic image creation.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a general and practical pipeline for glomerulus segmentation that effectively enhances both patch-level and WSI-level segmentation tasks. Our approach leverages stitching on overlapping patches, increasing the detection coverage, especially when glomeruli are located near patch image borders. In addition, we conduct comprehensive evaluations from different segmentation models across two large and diverse datasets with over 30K glomerulus annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that models using our pipeline outperform the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving superior results across both datasets and setting a new benchmark for glomerulus segmentation in WSIs.

However, a comprehensive evaluation of their long-context capabilities remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce the MultiModal Needle-in-a-haystack (MMNeedle) benchmark, specifically designed to assess the long-context capabilities of MLLMs. Besides multi-image input, we employ image stitching to further increase the input context length, and develop a protocol to automatically generate labels for sub-image level retrieval. Essentially, MMNeedle evaluates MLLMs by stress-testing their capability to locate a target sub-image (needle) within a set of images (haystack) based on textual instructions and descriptions of image contents. This setup necessitates an advanced understanding of extensive visual contexts and effective information retrieval within long-context image inputs. With this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, encompassing both API-based and open-source models. The findings reveal that GPT-4o consistently surpasses other models in long-context scenarios, but suffers from hallucination problems in negative samples, i.e., when needles are not in the haystacks. Our comprehensive long-context evaluation of MLLMs also sheds lights on the considerable performance gap between API-based and open-source models.

To reduce the annotation cost and maintain satisfactory performance, in this work, we leverage the capabilities of SAM for establishing semi-supervised medical image segmentation models. Rethinking the requirements of effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility, we propose a three-stage framework, i.e., Stitching, Fine-tuning, and Re-training (SFR). The current fine-tuning approaches mostly involve 2D slice-wise fine-tuning that disregards the contextual information between adjacent slices. Our stitching strategy mitigates the mismatch between natural and 3D medical images. The stitched images are then used for fine-tuning SAM, providing robust initialization of pseudo-labels. Afterwards, we train a 3D semi-supervised segmentation model while maintaining the same parameter size as the conventional segmenter such as V-Net. Our SFR framework is plug-and-play, and easily compatible with various popular semi-supervised methods. We also develop an extended framework SFR$^+$ with selective fine-tuning and re-training through confidence estimation. Extensive experiments validate that our SFR and SFR$^+$ achieve significant improvements in both moderate annotation and scarce annotation across five datasets. In particular, SFR framework improves the Dice score of Mean Teacher from 29.68% to 74.40% with only one labeled data of LA dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Local Patch Alignment to Seam-cutting for Large Parallax Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18564v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seam cutting methods have been proven effective in the composition step of image stitching, especially for images with parallax. However, current seam cutting can be seen as the subsequent step after the image alignment is settled. Its effectiveness usually depends on the fact that images can be roughly aligned such that a local region exists where an unnoticeable seam can be found. Current alignment methods often fall short of expectations for images with large parallax, and most efforts are devoted to improving the alignment accuracy. In this paper, we argue that by adding a simple Local Patch Alignment Module (LPAM) into the seam cutting, the final result can be efficiently improved for large parallax image stitching. Concretely, we first evaluate the quality of pixels along the estimated seam of the seam cutting method. Then, for pixels with low qualities, we separate their enclosing patches in the aligned images and locally align them by constructing modified dense correspondences via SIFT flow. Finally, we composite the aligned patches via seam cutting and merge them into the original aligned result to generate the final mosaic. Experiments show that introducing LPAM can effectively and efficiently improve the stitching results.</p></details> | In peer review | None |

However, for self-driving applications, merely de-identifying faces and individuals might not provide sufficient privacy protection since street views like vehicles and buildings can still disclose locations, trajectories, and other sensitive information. Therefore, it remains crucial to extend anonymization techniques to street view images to fully preserve the privacy of users, pedestrians, and vehicles. In this paper, we propose a Street View Image Anonymization (SVIA) framework for self-driving applications. The SVIA framework consists of three integral components: a semantic segmenter to segment an input image into functional regions, an inpainter to generate alternatives to privacy-sensitive regions, and a harmonizer to seamlessly stitch modified regions to guarantee visual coherence. Compared to existing methods, SVIA achieves a much better trade-off between image generation quality and privacy protection, as evidenced by experimental results for five common metrics on two widely used public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Object-level Geometric Structure Preserving for Natural Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12677v4)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The topic of stitching images with globally natural structures holds paramount significance, with two main goals: pixel-level alignment and distortion prevention. The existing approaches exhibit the ability to align well, yet fall short in maintaining object structures. In this paper, we endeavour to safeguard the overall OBJect-level structures within images based on Global Similarity Prior (OBJ-GSP), on the basis of good alignment performance. Our approach leverages semantic segmentation models like the family of Segment Anything Model to extract the contours of any objects in a scene. Triangular meshes are employed in image transformation to protect the overall shapes of objects within images. The balance between alignment and distortion prevention is achieved by allowing the object meshes to strike a balance between similarity and projective transformation. We also demonstrate that object-level semantic information is necessary in low-altitude aerial image stitching. Additionally, we propose StitchBench, the largest image stitching benchmark with most diverse scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OBJ-GSP outperforms existing methods in both pixel alignment and shape preservation.

However, using supervised learning methods is often challenging or costly due to the difficulty of collecting ground-truth data. In response, unsupervised learning approaches have emerged. Most early methods, though, assume that the given image pairs are from the same camera or have minor lighting differences. Consequently, while these methods perform effectively under such conditions, they generally fail when input image pairs come from different domains, referred to as multimodal image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose AltO, an unsupervised learning framework for estimating homography in multimodal image pairs. Our method employs a two-phase alternating optimization framework, similar to Expectation-Maximization (EM), where one phase reduces the geometry gap and the other addresses the modality gap. To handle these gaps, we use Barlow Twins loss for the modality gap and propose an extended version, Geometry Barlow Twins, for the geometry gap. As a result, we demonstrate that our method, AltO, can be trained on multimodal datasets without any ground-truth data. It not only outperforms other unsupervised methods but is also compatible with various architectures of homography estimators.

SSPGM utilizes a patch-conditioned ControlNet to generate realistic 2DUS stitching pairs with known affine matrix from a single input image. ISM then utilizes this synthetic paired data to learn 2DUS stitching in a supervised manner. Our framework was evaluated against multiple leading methods on a kidney ultrasound dataset, demonstrating superior 2DUS stitching performance through both qualitative and quantitative analyses.

For instance, while performing an insertion task when the hole or the recipient part is not visible in the eye-in-hand camera, a learning-based movement primitive method can be used to generate the end-effector path. Once the recipient part is in the field of view (FOV), Image-based Visual Servo (IBVS) can be used to control the motion of the robot. Inspired by such applications, this paper presents a generalized control scheme that switches between motion generation using DMPs and IBVS control. To facilitate the design, a common state space representation for the DMP and the IBVS systems is first established. Stability analysis of the switched system using multiple Lyapunov functions shows that the state trajectories converge to a bound asymptotically. The developed method is validated by two real world experiments using the eye-in-hand configuration on a Baxter research robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Stitching frames of a panning video into a panoramic photograph is a well-understood problem for stationary scenes, but when objects are moving, a still panorama cannot capture the scene. We present a method for synthesizing a panoramic video from a casually-captured panning video, as if the original video were captured with a wide-angle camera. We pose panorama synthesis as a space-time outpainting problem, where we aim to create a full panoramic video of the same length as the input video. Consistent completion of the space-time volume requires a powerful, realistic prior over video content and motion, for which we adapt generative video models. Existing generative models do not, however, immediately extend to panorama completion, as we show. We instead apply video generation as a component of our panorama synthesis system, and demonstrate how to exploit the strengths of the models while minimizing their limitations. Our system can create video panoramas for a range of in-the-wild scenes including people, vehicles, and flowing water, as well as stationary background features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://vidpanos.github.io/.

By merging consecutive frames, the framework generates a detailed panoramic view of the esophagus, enabling thorough and accurate visual analysis.

While there exist encoders that achieve good results in 3D GAN inversion, they are predominantly built on EG3D, which specializes in synthesizing near-frontal views and is limiting in synthesizing comprehensive 3D scenes from diverse viewpoints. In contrast to existing approaches, we propose a novel framework built on PanoHead, which excels in synthesizing images from a 360-degree perspective. To achieve realistic 3D modeling of the input image, we introduce a dual encoder system tailored for high-fidelity reconstruction and realistic generation from different viewpoints. Accompanying this, we propose a stitching framework on the triplane domain to get the best predictions from both. To achieve seamless stitching, both encoders must output consistent results despite being specialized for different tasks. For this reason, we carefully train these encoders using specialized losses, including an adversarial loss based on our novel occlusion-aware triplane discriminator. Experiments reveal that our approach surpasses the existing encoder training methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

It is essential for the robot to know the accurate state to manipulate cloth and execute tasks such as robotic dressing, stitching, and covering/uncovering human beings. However, estimating cloth state accurately remains challenging due to its high flexibility and self-occlusion. This paper proposes a diffusion model-based pipeline that formulates the cloth state estimation as an image generation problem by representing the cloth state as an RGB image that describes the point-wise translation (translation map) between a pre-defined flattened mesh and the deformed mesh in a canonical space. Then we train a conditional diffusion-based image generation model to predict the translation map based on an observation. Experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate the performance of our method. Results indicate that our method outperforms two recent methods in both accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  | None |

In our study, we employ the advanced SwinUNETR framework for synthesizing CT from MRI images. Additionally, we introduce a three-dimensional subvolume merging technique in the prediction process. By selecting an optimal overlap percentage for adjacent subvolumes, stitching artifacts are effectively mitigated, leading to a decrease in the mean absolute error (MAE) between sCT and the labels from 52.65 HU to 47.75 HU. Furthermore, implementing a weight function with a gamma value of 0.9 results in the lowest MAE within the same overlap area. By setting the overlap percentage between 50% and 70%, we achieve a balance between image quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

The total energy function is then optimized to order unordered images, and a hybrid energy function is introduced to optimize the best seam, effectively eliminating parallax artifacts. On the clinical dataset, Sx-Stitch demonstrates superiority over SOTA schemes both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  | None |

While supervised methods exist, the constraints of limited annotated data has encouraged development of unsupervised approaches. However, existing unsupervised methods resemble clustering and cannot be directly mapped to explicit target classes. In this paper, we deal with single shot semantic segmentation, where one example for the target class is provided, which is used to segment the target class from query/test images. Our approach exploits recently popular Segment Anything (SAM), a promptable foundation model. We specifically design several techniques to automatically generate prompts from the only example/key image in such a way that the segmentation is successfully achieved on a stitch or concatenation of the example/key and query/test images. Proposed technique does not involve any training phase and just requires one example image to grasp the concept. Furthermore, no text-based prompt is required for the proposed method. We evaluated the proposed techniques on building and car classes.</p></details> |  | None |

Typically, conventional image stitching techniques, other than deep learning, require complex computation and thus computational pricy, especially for stitching large raw images. In this study, inspired by the multiscale feature of fluid turbulence, we developed a fast feature point detection algorithm named local-peak scale-invariant feature transform (LP-SIFT), based on the multiscale local peaks and scale-invariant feature transform method. By combining LP-SIFT and RANSAC in image stitching, the stitching speed can be improved by orders, compared with the original SIFT method. Nine large images (over 2600*1600 pixels), arranged randomly without prior knowledge, can be stitched within 158.94 s. The algorithm is highly practical for applications requiring a wide field of view in diverse application scenes, e.g., terrain mapping, biological analysis, and even criminal investigation.</p></details> |  | None |

Image mosaicking is a technique for aligning multiple overlapping images to obtain a larger FoV. Current mosaicking pipelines often struggle with substantial noise and considerable displacement between the input sub-fields. In this paper, we propose a versatile pipeline for stitching multi-view OCT/OCTA \textit{en face} projection images. Our method combines the strengths of learning-based feature matching and robust pixel-based registration to align multiple images effectively. Furthermore, we advance the application of a trained foundational model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to validate mosaicking results in an unsupervised manner. The efficacy of our pipeline is validated using an in-house dataset and a large public dataset, where our method shows superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.

We investigate this by measuring the latent space similarity of four different models: VAEs, GANs, Normalizing Flows (NFs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Our methodology involves training linear maps between frozen latent spaces to "stitch" arbitrary pairs of encoders and decoders and measuring output-based and probe-based metrics on the resulting "stitched'' models. Our main findings are that linear maps between latent spaces of performant models preserve most visual information even when latent sizes differ; for CelebA models, gender is the most similarly represented probe-able attribute. Finally we show on an NF that latent space representations converge early in training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Eliminating Warping Shakes for Unsupervised Online Video Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06378v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, when extending image stitching to video stitching. It unveils the temporal instability of warped content in non-overlapping regions, despite image stitching having endeavored to preserve the natural structures. Therefore, in most cases, even if the input videos to be stitched are stable, the stitched video will inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and affect the visual experience. To eliminate the shakes, we propose StabStitch to simultaneously realize video stitching and video stabilization in a unified unsupervised learning framework. Starting from the camera paths in video stabilization, we first derive the expression of stitching trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal warps. Then a warp smoothing model is presented to optimize them with a comprehensive consideration regarding content alignment, trajectory smoothness, spatial consistency, and online collaboration. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes. Compared with existing stitching solutions, StabStitch exhibits significant superiority in scene robustness and inference speed in addition to stitching and stabilization performance, contributing to a robust and real-time online video stitching system.

Various warping-based methods are proposed to address it, yet the results are unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel image stitching method using multi-homography warping guided by image segmentation. Specifically, we leverage the Segment Anything Model to segment the target image into numerous contents and partition the feature points into multiple subsets via the energy-based multi-homography fitting algorithm. The multiple subsets of feature points are used to calculate the corresponding multiple homographies. For each segmented content in the overlapping region, we select its best-fitting homography with the lowest photometric error. For each segmented content in the non-overlapping region, we calculate a weighted combination of the linearized homographies. Finally, the target image is warped via the best-fitting homographies to align with the reference image, and the final panorama is generated via linear blending. Comprehensive experimental results on the public datasets demonstrate that our method provides the best alignment accuracy by a large margin, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

The popular method developed by Zhang relies on the use of a large number of images of a planar grid of fiducial points captured in multiple poses. Although flexible and easy to implement, Zhang's method has some limitations. The simultaneous optimization of the entire parameter set, including the coefficients of a predefined distortion model, may result in poor distortion correction at the image boundaries or in miscalculation of the intrinsic parameters, even with a reasonably small reprojection error. Indeed, applications involving image stitching (e.g. multi-camera systems) require accurate mapping of distortion up to the outermost regions of the image. Moreover, intrinsic parameters affect the accuracy of camera pose estimation, which is fundamental for applications such as vision servoing in robot navigation and automated assembly. This paper proposes a method for estimating the complete set of calibration parameters from a single image of a planar speckle pattern covering the entire sensor. The correspondence between image points and physical points on the calibration target is obtained using Digital Image Correlation. The effective focal length and the extrinsic parameters are calculated separately after a prior evaluation of the principal point. At the end of the procedure, a dense and uniform model-free distortion map is obtained over the entire image. Synthetic data with different noise levels were used to test the feasibility of the proposed method and to compare its metrological performance with Zhang's method. Real-world tests demonstrate the potential of the developed method to reveal aspects of the image formation that are hidden by averaging over multiple images.</p></details> | Accepted manuscript | None |

The color and brightness along stitched seam location may look discontinuous among multiple cameras which impacts overall stitched image visual quality. To improve the color transition between adjacent cameras in stitching algorithm, we propose harmonization algorithm which applies before stitching to adjust multiple cameras' color and tone so that stitched image has smoother color and tone transition between adjacent cameras. Our proposed harmonization algorithm consists of AWB harmonization and GTM harmonization leveraging Image Signal Processor (ISP)'s AWB and GTM metadata statistics. Experiment result shows that our proposed algorithm outperforms global color transfer method in both visual quality and computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |

As a common data augmentation method, Mosaic data augmentation technique stitches multiple images together to increase the diversity and complexity of training data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Although Mosaic data augmentation achieves excellent results in general detection tasks by stitching images together, it still has certain limitations for specific detection tasks. This paper addresses the challenge of detecting a large number of densely distributed small objects in aerial images by proposing the Select-Mosaic data augmentation method, which is improved with a fine-grained region selection strategy. The improved Select-Mosaic method demonstrates superior performance in handling dense small object detection tasks, significantly enhancing the accuracy and stability of detection models.

Each stage requires its own network training and is tightly coupled to the others, leading to error propagation and posing significant challenges to parameter tuning and system stability. This paper proposes the Simple and Robust Stitcher (SRStitcher), which revolutionizes the image stitching pipeline by simplifying the fusion and rectangling stages into a unified inpainting model, requiring no model training or fine-tuning. We reformulate the problem definitions of the fusion and rectangling stages and demonstrate that they can be effectively integrated into an inpainting task. Furthermore, we design the weighted masks to guide the reverse process in a pre-trained largescale diffusion model, implementing this integrated inpainting task in a single inference. Through extensive experimentation, we verify the interpretability and generalization capabilities of this unified model, demonstrating that SRStitcher outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and stability.

Existing methods often struggle to maintain both the local and global structures of the image while reducing alignment artifacts and warping distortions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes epipolar geometry to establish a warping technique based on the epipolar displacement field. Initially, the warping rule for pixels in the epipolar geometry is established through the infinite homography. Subsequently, the epipolar displacement field, which represents the sliding distance of the warped pixel along the epipolar line, is formulated by thin-plate splines based on the principle of local elastic deformation. The stitching result can be generated by inversely warping the pixels according to the epipolar displacement field. This method incorporates the epipolar constraints in the warping rule, which ensures high-quality alignment and maintains the projectivity of the panorama. Qualitative and quantitative comparative experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method for stitching images with large parallax.</p></details> |  | None |

To alleviate the modality gap, recent methods generate intermediate images by GANs, grayscaling, or mixup strategies. However, these methods could introduce extra data distribution, and the semantic correspondence between the two modalities is not well learned. In this paper, we propose a Patch-Mixed Cross-Modality framework (PMCM), where two images of the same person from two modalities are split into patches and stitched into a new one for model learning. A part-alignment loss is introduced to regularize representation learning, and a patch-mixed modality learning loss is proposed to align between the modalities. In this way, the model learns to recognize a person through patches of different styles, thereby the modality semantic correspondence can be inferred. In addition, with the flexible image generation strategy, the patch-mixed images freely adjust the ratio of different modality patches, which could further alleviate the modality imbalance problem. On two VI-ReID datasets, we report new state-of-the-art performance with the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose the Evolutionary Stitched Camera calibration (ESC) algorithm to bridge this gap. It consists of image segmentation followed by evolutionary optimization of a novel loss function, providing a unified and accurate multi-camera calibration solution with high visual fidelity. The outcome allows the creation of virtual stitched views from multiple video sources, being as important for practical applications as numerical accuracy.

To solve non-rectangular boundaries, current solutions involve cropping, which discards image content, inpainting, which can introduce unrelated content, or warping, which can distort non-linear features and introduce artifacts. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel diffusion-based learning framework, \textbf{RecDiffusion}, for image stitching rectangling. This framework combines Motion Diffusion Models (MDM) to generate motion fields, effectively transitioning from the stitched image's irregular borders to a geometrically corrected intermediary. Followed by Content Diffusion Models (CDM) for image detail refinement. Notably, our sampling process utilizes a weighted map to identify regions needing correction during each iteration of CDM. Our RecDiffusion ensures geometric accuracy and overall visual appeal, surpassing all previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative measures when evaluated on public benchmarks.

| **[Towards Robust Image Stitching: An Adaptive Resistance Learning against Compatible Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15959v1)** | 2024-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching seamlessly integrates images captured from varying perspectives into a single wide field-of-view image. Such integration not only broadens the captured scene but also augments holistic perception in computer vision applications. Given a pair of captured images, subtle perturbations and distortions which go unnoticed by the human visual system tend to attack the correspondence matching, impairing the performance of image stitching algorithms. In light of this challenge, this paper presents the first attempt to improve the robustness of image stitching against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce a stitching-oriented attack~(SoA), tailored to amplify the alignment loss within overlapping regions, thereby targeting the feature matching procedure. To establish an attack resistant model, we delve into the robustness of stitching architecture and develop an adaptive adversarial training~(AAT) to balance attack resistance with stitching precision. In this way, we relieve the gap between the routine adversarial training and benign models, ensuring resilience without quality compromise. Comprehensive evaluation across real-world and synthetic datasets validate the deterioration of SoA on stitching performance. Furthermore, AAT emerges as a more robust solution against adversarial perturbations, delivering superior stitching results.

| **[T-Stitch: Accelerating Sampling in Pre-Trained Diffusion Models with Trajectory Stitching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14167v1)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) is often expensive for high-quality image generation and typically requires many steps with a large model. In this paper, we introduce sampling Trajectory Stitching T-Stitch, a simple yet efficient technique to improve the sampling efficiency with little or no generation degradation. Instead of solely using a large DPM for the entire sampling trajectory, T-Stitch first leverages a smaller DPM in the initial steps as a cheap drop-in replacement of the larger DPM and switches to the larger DPM at a later stage. Our key insight is that different diffusion models learn similar encodings under the same training data distribution and smaller models are capable of generating good global structures in the early steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that T-Stitch is training-free, generally applicable for different architectures, and complements most existing fast sampling techniques with flexible speed and quality trade-offs. On DiT-XL, for example, 40% of the early timesteps can be safely replaced with a 10x faster DiT-S without performance drop on class-conditional ImageNet generation. We further show that our method can also be used as a drop-in technique to not only accelerate the popular pretrained stable diffusion (SD) models but also improve the prompt alignment of stylized SD models from the public model zoo.

Dental CBCT alone may not be able to delineate precise details of the tooth surface due to limited image resolution and various CBCT artifacts, including metal-induced artifacts. IOS is very accurate for the scanning of narrow areas, but it produces cumulative stitching errors during full-arch scanning. The proposed method is intended not only to compensate the low-quality of CBCT-derived tooth surfaces with IOS, but also to correct the cumulative stitching errors of IOS across the entire dental arch. Moreover, the integration provide both gingival structure of IOS and tooth roots of CBCT in one image. The proposed fully automated method consists of four parts; (i) individual tooth segmentation and identification module for IOS data (TSIM-IOS); (ii) individual tooth segmentation and identification module for CBCT data (TSIM-CBCT); (iii) global-to-local tooth registration between IOS and CBCT; and (iv) stitching error correction of full-arch IOS. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved landmark and surface distance errors of 112.4 $μ$m and 301.7 $μ$m, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they suffer from blurry artifacts and disparities in illumination, depth level, etc. Although the recent learning-based stitchings relax such disparities, the required methods impose sacrifice of image qualities failing to capture high-frequency details for stitched images. To address the problem, we propose a novel approach, implicit Neural Image Stitching (NIS) that extends arbitrary-scale super-resolution. Our method estimates Fourier coefficients of images for quality-enhancing warps. Then, the suggested model blends color mismatches and misalignment in the latent space and decodes the features into RGB values of stitched images.

Previous studies that have primarily focused on accurately reconstructing garment geometries to match the input garment image may often result in unnatural-looking garments when deformed for new poses. To overcome this limitation, our approach takes a different approach by inferring the fundamental shape of the garment through sewing patterns from a single image, rather than directly reconstructing 3D garments. Our method consists of two stages. Firstly, given a single image of a posed user, it predicts the garment image worn on a T-pose, representing the baseline form of the garment. Then, it estimates the sewing pattern parameters based on the T-pose garment image. By simulating the stitching and draping of the sewing pattern using physics simulation, we can generate 3D garments that can adaptively deform to arbitrary poses. The effectiveness of our method is validated through ablation studies on the major components and a comparison with other approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a single satellite image can cover only a limited area. In cases where a larger area of interest is studied, several images must be stitched together to create a single larger image, called a mosaic, that can cover the area. Today, with the increasing number of satellite images available for commercial use, selecting the images to build the mosaic is challenging, especially when the user wants to optimize one or more parameters, such as the total cost and the cloud coverage percentage in the mosaic. More precisely, for this problem the input is an area of interest, several satellite images intersecting the area, a list of requirements relative to the image and the mosaic, such as cloud coverage percentage, image resolution, and a list of objectives to optimize. We contribute to the constraint and mixed integer lineal programming formulation of this new problem, which we call the \textit{satellite image mosaic selection problem}, which is a multi-objective extension of the polygon cover problem. We propose a dataset of realistic and challenging instances, where the images were captured by the satellite constellations SPOT, Pléiades and Pléiades Neo. We evaluate and compare the two proposed models and show their efficiency for large instances, up to 200 images.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper contains minor corrections from the original document presented at the 29th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2023).

However, naive stitching of multiple images often results in visible seams. Recent techniques have attempted to address this issue by performing joint diffusions in multiple windows and averaging latent features in overlapping regions. However, these approaches, which focus on seamless montage generation, often yield incoherent outputs by blending different scenes within a single image. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncDiffusion, a plug-and-play module that synchronizes multiple diffusions through gradient descent from a perceptual similarity loss. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the perceptual loss using the predicted denoised images at each denoising step, providing meaningful guidance for achieving coherent montages. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method produces significantly more coherent outputs compared to previous methods (66.35% vs. 33.65% in our user study) while still maintaining fidelity (as assessed by GIQA) and compatibility with the input prompt (as measured by CLIP score). We further demonstrate the versatility of our method across three plug-and-play applications: layout-guided image generation, conditional image generation and 360-degree panorama generation.

| **[DeepIron: Predicting Unwarped Garment Texture from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15447v2)** | 2023-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic reconstruction of 3D clothing from an image has wide applications, such as avatar creation and virtual try-on. This paper presents a novel framework that reconstructs the texture map for 3D garments from a single image with pose. Assuming that 3D garments are modeled by stitching 2D garment sewing patterns, our specific goal is to generate a texture image for the sewing patterns. A key component of our framework, the Texture Unwarper, infers the original texture image from the input clothing image, which exhibits warping and occlusion of texture due to the user's body shape and pose. The Texture Unwarper effectively transforms between the input and output images by mapping the latent spaces of the two images. By inferring the unwarped original texture of the input garment, our method helps reconstruct 3D garment models that can show high-quality texture images realistically deformed for new poses. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through a comparison with other methods and ablation studies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Residual Elastic Warps for Image Stitching under Dirichlet Boundary Condition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01406v3)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trendy suggestions for learning-based elastic warps enable the deep image stitchings to align images exposed to large parallax errors. Despite the remarkable alignments, the methods struggle with occasional holes or discontinuity between overlapping and non-overlapping regions of a target image as the applied training strategy mostly focuses on overlap region alignment. As a result, they require additional modules such as seam finder and image inpainting for hiding discontinuity and filling holes, respectively. In this work, we suggest Recurrent Elastic Warps (REwarp) that address the problem with Dirichlet boundary condition and boost performances by residual learning for recurrent misalign correction. Specifically, REwarp predicts a homography and a Thin-plate Spline (TPS) under the boundary constraint for discontinuity and hole-free image stitching. Our experiments show the favorable aligns and the competitive computational costs of REwarp compared to the existing stitching methods.

| **[$H$-RANSAC, an algorithmic variant for Homography image transform from featureless point sets: application to video-based football analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04912v1)** | 2023-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating homography matrix between two images has various applications like image stitching or image mosaicing and spatial information retrieval from multiple camera views, but has been proved to be a complicated problem, especially in cases of radically different camera poses and zoom factors. Many relevant approaches have been proposed, utilizing direct feature based, or deep learning methodologies. In this paper, we propose a generalized RANSAC algorithm, H-RANSAC, to retrieve homography image transformations from sets of points without descriptive local feature vectors and point pairing. We allow the points to be optionally labelled in two classes. We propose a robust criterion that rejects implausible point selection before each iteration of RANSAC, based on the type of the quadrilaterals formed by random point pair selection (convex or concave and (non)-self-intersecting). A similar post-hoc criterion rejects implausible homography transformations is included at the end of each iteration. The expected maximum iterations of $H$-RANSAC are derived for different probabilities of success, according to the number of points per image and per class, and the percentage of outliers. The proposed methodology is tested on a large dataset of images acquired by 12 cameras during real football matches, where radically different views at each timestamp are to be matched. Comparisons with state-of-the-art implementations of RANSAC combined with classic and deep learning image salient point detection indicates the superiority of the proposed $H$-RANSAC, in terms of average reprojection error and number of successfully processed pairs of frames, rendering it the method of choice in cases of image homography alignment with few tens of points, while local features are not available, or not descriptive enough.

| **[Light Field Depth Estimation via Stitched Epipolar Plane Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15201v3)** | 2023-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation is a fundamental problem in light field processing. Epipolar-plane image (EPI)-based methods often encounter challenges such as low accuracy in slope computation due to discretization errors and limited angular resolution. Besides, existing methods perform well in most regions but struggle to produce sharp edges in occluded regions and resolve ambiguities in texture-less regions. To address these issues, we propose the concept of stitched-EPI (SEPI) to enhance slope computation. SEPI achieves this by shifting and concatenating lines from different EPIs that correspond to the same 3D point. Moreover, we introduce the half-SEPI algorithm, which focuses exclusively on the non-occluded portion of lines to handle occlusion. Additionally, we present a depth propagation strategy aimed at improving depth estimation in texture-less regions. This strategy involves determining the depth of such regions by progressing from the edges towards the interior, prioritizing accurate regions over coarse regions. Through extensive experimental evaluations and ablation studies, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results demonstrate its superior ability to generate more accurate and robust depth maps across all regions compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The straightforward image stitching approach will cause temporal flicking and color inconstancy when it is applied to the video stitching task. Besides, inaccurate camera parameters will cause artifacts in the image warping. In this paper, we propose a real-time system to stitch multiple video sequences into a panoramic video, which is based on GPU accelerated color correction and frame warping without accurate camera parameters. We extend the traditional 2D-Matrix (2D-M) color correction approach and a present spatio-temporal 3D-Matrix (3D-M) color correction method for the overlap local regions with online color balancing using a piecewise function on global frames. Furthermore, we use pairwise homography matrices given by coarse camera calibration for global warping followed by accurate local warping based on the optical flow. Experimental results show that our system can generate highquality panorama videos in real time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Spectral Image Stitching via Spatial Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16741v1)** | 2023-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-spectral image stitching leverages the complementarity between infrared and visible images to generate a robust and reliable wide field-of-view (FOV) scene. The primary challenge of this task is to explore the relations between multi-spectral images for aligning and integrating multi-view scenes. Capitalizing on the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in modeling feature relationships, we propose a spatial graph reasoning based multi-spectral image stitching method that effectively distills the deformation and integration of multi-spectral images across different viewpoints. To accomplish this, we embed multi-scale complementary features from the same view position into a set of nodes. The correspondence across different views is learned through powerful dense feature embeddings, where both inter- and intra-correlations are developed to exploit cross-view matching and enhance inner feature disparity. By introducing long-range coherence along spatial and channel dimensions, the complementarity of pixel relations and channel interdependencies aids in the reconstruction of aligned multi-view features, generating informative and reliable wide FOV scenes. Moreover, we release a challenging dataset named ChaMS, comprising both real-world and synthetic sets with significant parallax, providing a new option for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[A Stronger Stitching Algorithm for Fisheye Images based on Deblurring and Registration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11997v1)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fisheye lens, which is suitable for panoramic imaging, has the prominent advantage of a large field of view and low cost. However, the fisheye image has a severe geometric distortion which may interfere with the stage of image registration and stitching. Aiming to resolve this drawback, we devise a stronger stitching algorithm for fisheye images by combining the traditional image processing method with deep learning. In the stage of fisheye image correction, we propose the Attention-based Nonlinear Activation Free Network (ANAFNet) to deblur fisheye images corrected by Zhang calibration method. Specifically, ANAFNet adopts the classical single-stage U-shaped architecture based on convolutional neural networks with soft-attention technique and it can restore a sharp image from a blurred image effectively. In the part of image registration, we propose the ORB-FREAK-GMS (OFG), a comprehensive image matching algorithm, to improve the accuracy of image registration. Experimental results demonstrate that panoramic images of superior quality stitching by fisheye images can be obtained through our method.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Parallax-Tolerant Unsupervised Deep Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08207v2)** | 2023-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional image stitching approaches tend to leverage increasingly complex geometric features (point, line, edge, etc.) for better performance. However, these hand-crafted features are only suitable for specific natural scenes with adequate geometric structures. In contrast, deep stitching schemes overcome the adverse conditions by adaptively learning robust semantic features, but they cannot handle large-parallax cases due to homography-based registration. To solve these issues, we propose UDIS++, a parallax-tolerant unsupervised deep image stitching technique. First, we propose a robust and flexible warp to model the image registration from global homography to local thin-plate spline motion. It provides accurate alignment for overlapping regions and shape preservation for non-overlapping regions by joint optimization concerning alignment and distortion. Subsequently, to improve the generalization capability, we design a simple but effective iterative strategy to enhance the warp adaption in cross-dataset and cross-resolution applications. Finally, to further eliminate the parallax artifacts, we propose to composite the stitched image seamlessly by unsupervised learning for seam-driven composition masks. Compared with existing methods, our solution is parallax-tolerant and free from laborious designs of complicated geometric features for specific scenes. Extensive experiments show our superiority over the SoTA methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[Deep Seam Prediction for Image Stitching Based on Selection Consistency Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05027v2)** | 2023-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching is to construct panoramic images with wider field of vision (FOV) from some images captured from different viewing positions. To solve the problem of fusion ghosting in the stitched image, seam-driven methods avoid the misalignment area to fuse images by predicting the best seam. Currently, as standard tools of the OpenCV library, dynamic programming (DP) and GraphCut (GC) are still the only commonly used seam prediction methods despite the fact that they were both proposed two decades ago. However, GC can get excellent seam quality but poor real-time performance while DP method has good efficiency but poor seam quality. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based seam prediction method (DSeam) for the sake of high seam quality with high efficiency. To overcome the difficulty of the seam description in network and no GroundTruth for training we design a selective consistency loss combining the seam shape constraint and seam quality constraint to supervise the network learning. By the constraint of the selection of consistency loss, we implicitly defined the mask boundaries as seams and transform seam prediction into mask prediction. To our knowledge, the proposed DSeam is the first deep learning based seam prediction method for image stitching. Extensive experimental results well demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Dseam method which is 15 times faster than the classic GC seam prediction method in OpenCV 2.4.9 with similar seam quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, incorrect matches may still exist. Thus, a novel sampling scheme, Pentagon-Match (PMatch), is proposed in this work to verify the correctness of initially matched keypoints using pentagons randomly sampled from them. By ensuring shape and location of these pentagons are view-invariant with various evaluations of cross-ratio (CR), incorrect matches of keypoint can be identified easily with homography estimated from correctly matched pentagons. Experimental results show that highly accurate estimation of homography can be obtained efficiently for planar scenes of the HPatches dataset, based on keypoint matching results provided by LoFTR. Besides, accurate outlier identification for the above matching results and possible extension of the approach for multi-plane situation are also demonstrated.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2211.03007</p></details> | None |

But in computer vision, the difficulties for in-context learning lie in that tasks vary significantly in the output representations, thus it is unclear how to define the general-purpose task prompts that the vision model can understand and transfer to out-of-domain tasks. In this work, we present Painter, a generalist model which addresses these obstacles with an "image"-centric solution, that is, to redefine the output of core vision tasks as images, and specify task prompts as also images. With this idea, our training process is extremely simple, which performs standard masked image modeling on the stitch of input and output image pairs. This makes the model capable of performing tasks conditioned on visible image patches. Thus, during inference, we can adopt a pair of input and output images from the same task as the input condition, to indicate which task to perform. Without bells and whistles, our generalist Painter can achieve competitive performance compared to well-established task-specific models, on seven representative vision tasks ranging from high-level visual understanding to low-level image processing. In addition, Painter significantly outperforms recent generalist models on several challenging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2023.

Challenges inevitably arise when the scene is non-planar and the camera baseline is wide, since parallax becomes not negligible in such cases. In this paper, we propose a novel NIS method using depth maps, which generates natural-looking mosaics against parallax in both overlapping and non-overlapping regions. Firstly, we construct a robust fitting method to filter out the outliers in feature matches and estimate the epipolar geometry between input images. Then, we draw a triangulation of the target image and estimate multiple local homographies, one per triangle, based on the locations of their vertices, the rectified depth values and the epipolar geometry. Finally, the warping image is rendered by the backward mapping of piece-wise homographies. Panorama is then produced via average blending and image inpainting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only provides accurate alignment in the overlapping regions but also virtual naturalness in the non-overlapping region.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

The newly produced image is unseen and is generated from the algorithm itself. Balancing the structure and style components has been the major challenge that other state-of-the-art algorithms have tried to solve. Despite all the efforts, it's still a major challenge to apply the artistic style that was originally created on top of the structure of the content image while maintaining consistency. In this work, we solved these problems by using a Deep Learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks. Our implementation will first extract foreground from the background using the pre-trained Detectron 2 model from the content image, and then apply the Arbitrary Style Transfer technique that is used in SANet. Once we have the two styled images, we will stitch the two chunks of images after the process of style transfer for the complete end piece.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, such training requires datasets composed of pairs of corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth targets. Unfortunately, such data is not available in many applications. For the task of image denoising in which the noise statistics is unknown, several self-supervised training methods have been proposed for overcoming this difficulty. Some of these require knowledge of the noise model, while others assume that the contaminating noise is uncorrelated, both assumptions are too limiting for many practical needs. This work proposes a novel self-supervised training technique suitable for the removal of unknown correlated noise. The proposed approach neither requires knowledge of the noise model nor access to ground truth targets. The input to our algorithm consists of easily captured bursts of noisy shots. Our algorithm constructs artificial patch-craft images from these bursts by patch matching and stitching, and the obtained crafted images are used as targets for the training. Our method does not require registration of the images within the burst. We evaluate the proposed framework through extensive experiments with synthetic and real image noise.</p></details> |  | None |

This unified model borrows from the basic Dual Recursive Network (DRN) architecture developed by Cai et al. The proposed model makes use of cross-stitch units that enable multi-task learning across two separate DRN models, each tasked for single image deraining and desnowing, respectively. By fixing cross-stitch units at several layers of basic task-specific DRN networks, we perform multi-task learning over the two separate DRN models. To enable blind image restoration, on top of these structures we employ a simple neural fusion scheme which merges the output of each DRN. The separate task-specific DRN models and the fusion scheme are simultaneously trained by enforcing local and global supervision. Local supervision is applied on the two DRN submodules, and global supervision is applied on the data fusion submodule of the proposed model. Consequently, we both enable feature sharing across task-specific DRN models and control the image restoration behavior of the DRN submodules. An ablation study shows the strength of the hypothesized CMUDRN model, and experiments indicate that its performance is comparable or better than baseline DRN models on the single image deraining and desnowing tasks. Moreover, CMUDRN enables blind image restoration for the two underlying image restoration tasks, by unifying task-specific image restoration pipelines via a naive parametric fusion scheme.

However, incorrect matches may still exist, while careful examination of such problems is often skipped. Accordingly, a geometrically constrained algorithm is proposed in this work to verify the correctness of initially matched SIFT keypoints based on view-invariant cross-ratios (CRs). By randomly forming pentagons from these keypoints and matching their shape and location among images with CRs, robust planar region estimation can be achieved efficiently for the above verification, while correct and incorrect matches of keypoints can be examined easily with respect to those shape and location matched pentagons. Experimental results show that satisfactory results can be obtained for various scenes with single as well as multiple planar regions.</p></details> |  | None |

As traditional neural network-based methods have limitations in the output image sizes (up to 1024x512) due to GPU memory constraints, both 360MonoDepth and our method rely on stitching multiple perspective disparity or depth images to come out a unified panoramic depth map. However, to achieve globally consistent stitching, 360MonoDepth relied on solving extensive disparity map alignment and Poisson-based blending problems, leading to high computation time. Instead, we propose to use an existing panoramic depth map (computed in real-time by any panorama-based method) as the common target for the individual perspective depth maps to register to. This key idea made producing globally consistent stitching results from a straightforward task. Our experiments show that our method generates qualitatively better results than existing panorama-based methods, and further outperforms them quantitatively on datasets unseen by these methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2023, to appear</p></details> | None |

To overcome this difficulty, we develop a weakly-supervised learning mechanism to train the stitching model without requiring genuine ground truth images. In addition, we propose a stitching model that takes multiple real-world fisheye images as inputs and creates a 360 output image in an equirectangular projection format. In particular, our model consists of color consistency corrections, warping, and blending, and is trained by perceptual and SSIM losses.

Registration for these image sequences is essential for in-line pattern inspection and metrology, e.g., in the printing process of flexible electronics. However, conventional image registration algorithms cannot produce accurate results when the images contain many similar and deformable patterns in the manufacturing process. Such a failure originates from a fact that the conventional algorithms only use the spatial and pixel intensity information for registration. Considering the nature of temporal continuity and consecution of the product images, in this paper, we propose a closed-loop feedback registration algorithm for matching and stitching the deformable printed patterns on a moving flexible substrate. The algorithm leverages the temporal and spatial relationships of the consecutive images and the continuity of the image sequence for fast, accurate, and robust point matching. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can find more matching point pairs with a lower root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms while offering significant improvements to running time.</p></details> |  | None |

With the development of advanced driver assistance systems~(ADAS) and their applications in autonomous vehicles, experimenting with different scenarios becomes a challenge. Although the photo-realistic street scenes can be synthesized by image-to-image translation methods, which cannot produce coherent scenes due to the lack of 3D information. In this paper, a large-scale neural rendering method is proposed to synthesize the autonomous driving scene~(READ), which makes it possible to synthesize large-scale driving scenarios on a PC through a variety of sampling schemes. In order to represent driving scenarios, we propose an ω rendering network to learn neural descriptors from sparse point clouds. Our model can not only synthesize realistic driving scenes but also stitch and edit driving scenes. Experiments show that our model performs well in large-scale driving scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Thin Format Vision-Based Tactile Sensor with A Micro Lens Array (MLA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08691v1)** | 2022-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based tactile sensors have been widely studied in the robotics field for high spatial resolution and compatibility with machine learning algorithms. However, the currently employed sensor's imaging system is bulky limiting its further application. Here we present a micro lens array (MLA) based vison system to achieve a low thickness format of the sensor package with high tactile sensing performance. Multiple micromachined micro lens units cover the whole elastic touching layer and provide a stitched clear tactile image, enabling high spatial resolution with a thin thickness of 5 mm. The thermal reflow and soft lithography method ensure the uniform spherical profile and smooth surface of micro lens. Both optical and mechanical characterization demonstrated the sensor's stable imaging and excellent tactile sensing, enabling precise 3D tactile information, such as displacement mapping and force distribution with an ultra compact-thin structure.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[GIRAFFE HD: A High-Resolution 3D-aware Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14954v1)** | 2022-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D-aware generative models have shown that the introduction of 3D information can lead to more controllable image generation. In particular, the current state-of-the-art model GIRAFFE can control each object's rotation, translation, scale, and scene camera pose without corresponding supervision. However, GIRAFFE only operates well when the image resolution is low. We propose GIRAFFE HD, a high-resolution 3D-aware generative model that inherits all of GIRAFFE's controllable features while generating high-quality, high-resolution images ($512^2$ resolution and above). The key idea is to leverage a style-based neural renderer, and to independently generate the foreground and background to force their disentanglement while imposing consistency constraints to stitch them together to composite a coherent final image. We demonstrate state-of-the-art 3D controllable high-resolution image generation on multiple natural image datasets.</p></details> | CVPR 2022 | None |

Previous methods suffered from overfitting to the training resolution and deterministic generation. This paper proposes a completion method using a transformer for scene modeling and novel methods to improve the properties of a 360-degree image on the output image. Specifically, we use CompletionNets with a transformer to perform diverse completions and AdjustmentNet to match color, stitching, and resolution with an input image, enabling inference at any resolution. To improve the properties of a 360-degree image on an output image, we also propose WS-perceptual loss and circular inference. Thorough experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. For example, compared to SOTA methods, our method completes images 16 times larger in resolution and achieves 1.7 times lower Frechet inception distance (FID). Furthermore, we propose a pipeline that uses the completion results for lighting and background of 3DCG scenes. Our plausible background completion enables perceptually natural results in the application of inserting virtual objects with specular surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2022.

| **[Deep Rectangling for Image Stitching: A Learning Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03831v4)** | 2022-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stitched images provide a wide field-of-view (FoV) but suffer from unpleasant irregular boundaries. To deal with this problem, existing image rectangling methods devote to searching an initial mesh and optimizing a target mesh to form the mesh deformation in two stages. Then rectangular images can be generated by warping stitched images. However, these solutions only work for images with rich linear structures, leading to noticeable distortions for portraits and landscapes with non-linear objects. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing the first deep learning solution to image rectangling. Concretely, we predefine a rigid target mesh and only estimate an initial mesh to form the mesh deformation, contributing to a compact one-stage solution. The initial mesh is predicted using a fully convolutional network with a residual progressive regression strategy. To obtain results with high content fidelity, a comprehensive objective function is proposed to simultaneously encourage the boundary rectangular, mesh shape-preserving, and content perceptually natural. Besides, we build the first image stitching rectangling dataset with a large diversity in irregular boundaries and scenes. Experiments demonstrate our superiority over traditional methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2022 (oral); Codes and dataset: https://github.com/nie-lang/DeepRectangling</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/nie-lang/DeepRectangling) |

Many recent 3D facial texture reconstruction and pose manipulation from a single image approaches still rely on large and clean face datasets to train image-to-image Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Yet the collection of such a large scale high-resolution 3D texture dataset is still very costly and difficult to maintain age/ethnicity balance. Moreover, regression-based approaches suffer from generalization to the in-the-wild conditions and are unable to fine-tune to a target-image. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for one-shot 3D facial texture completion that does not require large-scale texture datasets, but rather harnesses the knowledge stored in 2D face generators. The proposed approach rotates an input image in 3D and fill-in the unseen regions by reconstructing the rotated image in a 2D face generator, based on the visible parts. Finally, we stitch the most visible textures at different angles in the UV image-plane. Further, we frontalize the target image by projecting the completed texture into the generator. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the completed UV textures and frontalized images are of high quality, resembles the original identity, can be used to train a texture GAN model for 3DMM fitting and improve pose-invariant face recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/barisgecer/OSTeC</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/barisgecer/OSTeC) |
| **[Human Face Recognition from Part of a Facial Image based on Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05601v1)** | 2022-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the current techniques for face recognition require the presence of a full face of the person to be recognized, and this situation is difficult to achieve in practice, the required person may appear with a part of his face, which requires prediction of the part that did not appear. Most of the current forecasting processes are done by what is known as image interpolation, which does not give reliable results, especially if the missing part is large. In this work, we adopted the process of stitching the face by completing the missing part with the flipping of the part shown in the picture, depending on the fact that the human face is characterized by symmetry in most cases. To create a complete model, two facial recognition methods were used to prove the efficiency of the algorithm. The selected face recognition algorithms that are applied here are Eigenfaces and geometrical methods. Image stitching is the process during which distinctive photographic images are combined to make a complete scene or a high-resolution image. Several images are integrated to form a wide-angle panoramic image. The quality of the image stitching is determined by calculating the similarity among the stitched image and original images and by the presence of the seam lines through the stitched images. The Eigenfaces approach utilizes PCA calculation to reduce the feature vector dimensions. It provides an effective approach for discovering the lower-dimensional space. In addition, to enable the proposed algorithm to recognize the face, it also ensures a fast and effective way of classifying faces. The phase of feature extraction is followed by the classifier phase.</p></details> |  | None |

Comprehensive understanding and clinical diagnosis rely on co-registration with the gold standard, histology images, which is extremely challenging due to the difference of both images. Here, we show an unsupervised image-to-image translation network that significantly improves the success of the co-registration using a conventional optimisation-based regression network, applicable to autofluorescence lifetime images at different emission wavelengths. A preliminary blind comparison by experienced researchers shows the superiority of our method on co-registration. The results also indicate that the approach is applicable to various image formats, like fluorescence intensity images. With the registration, stitching outcomes illustrate the distinct differences of the spectral lifetime across an unstained tissue, enabling macro-level rapid visual identification of lung cancer and cellular-level characterisation of cell variants and common types. The approach could be effortlessly extended to lifetime images beyond this range and other staining technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, 5 equations, 1 table</p></details> | None |

In this study, we collect a large image data set to re-label them as a multi-label image classification problem so as to identify smoke and flame simultaneously. In order to solve the generalization ability of the detection model on account of the movable fluid objects with uncertain shapes like fire and smoke, and their not compactible natures as well as the complex backgrounds with high variations, we propose a data augment method by random image stitch to deploy resizing, deforming, position variation, and background altering so as to enlarge the view of the learner. Moreover, we propose a self-learning data augment method by using the class activation map to extract the highly trustable region as new data source of positive examples to further enhance the data augment. By the mutual reinforcement between the data augment and the detection model that are performed iteratively, both modules make progress in an evolutionary manner. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively improve the generalization performance of the model for concurrent smoke and fire detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pixel-wise Deep Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06171v1)** | 2021-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching aims at stitching the images taken from different viewpoints into an image with a wider field of view. Existing methods warp the target image to the reference image using the estimated warp function, and a homography is one of the most commonly used warping functions. However, when images have large parallax due to non-planar scenes and translational motion of a camera, the homography cannot fully describe the mapping between two images. Existing approaches based on global or local homography estimation are not free from this problem and suffer from undesired artifacts due to parallax. In this paper, instead of relying on the homography-based warp, we propose a novel deep image stitching framework exploiting the pixel-wise warp field to handle the large-parallax problem. The proposed deep image stitching framework consists of two modules: Pixel-wise Warping Module (PWM) and Stitched Image Generating Module (SIGMo). PWM employs an optical flow estimation model to obtain pixel-wise warp of the whole image, and relocates the pixels of the target image with the obtained warp field. SIGMo blends the warped target image and the reference image while eliminating unwanted artifacts such as misalignments, seams, and holes that harm the plausibility of the stitched result. For training and evaluating the proposed framework, we build a large-scale dataset that includes image pairs with corresponding pixel-wise ground truth warp and sample stitched result images. We show that the results of the proposed framework are qualitatively superior to those of the conventional methods, especially when the images have large parallax. The code and the proposed dataset will be publicly available soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Probabilistic Spatial Distribution Prior Based Attentional Keypoints Matching Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09006v2)** | 2021-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keypoints matching is a pivotal component for many image-relevant applications such as image stitching, visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and so on. Both handcrafted-based and recently emerged deep learning-based keypoints matching methods merely rely on keypoints and local features, while losing sight of other available sensors such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) in the above applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that the motion estimation from IMU integration can be used to exploit the spatial distribution prior of keypoints between images. To this end, a probabilistic perspective of attention formulation is proposed to integrate the spatial distribution prior into the attentional graph neural network naturally. With the assistance of spatial distribution prior, the effort of the network for modeling the hidden features can be reduced. Furthermore, we present a projection loss for the proposed keypoints matching network, which gives a smooth edge between matching and un-matching keypoints. Image matching experiments on visual SLAM datasets indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented method.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional homography estimation methods heavily depend on the quantity and distribution of feature correspondences, leading to poor robustness in low-texture scenes. The learning solutions, on the contrary, try to learn robust deep features but demonstrate unsatisfying performance in the scenes with low overlap rates. In this paper, we address these two problems simultaneously by designing a contextual correlation layer (CCL). The CCL can efficiently capture the long-range correlation within feature maps and can be flexibly used in a learning framework. In addition, considering that a single homography can not represent the complex spatial transformation in depth-varying images with parallax, we propose to predict multi-grid homography from global to local. Moreover, we equip our network with a depth perception capability, by introducing a novel depth-aware shape-preserved loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art solutions in the synthetic benchmark dataset and real-world dataset.

It has been observed that current deepfake generation methods leave discriminative artifacts in the frequency spectrum of fake images and videos. Inspired by this observation, in this paper, we present a novel approach, termed as MD-CSDNetwork, for combining the features in the spatial and frequency domains to mine a shared discriminative representation for classifying \textit{deepfakes}. MD-CSDNetwork is a novel cross-stitched network with two parallel branches carrying the spatial and frequency information, respectively. We hypothesize that these multi-domain input data streams can be considered as related supervisory signals. The supervision from both branches ensures better performance and generalization. Further, the concept of cross-stitch connections is utilized where they are inserted between the two branches to learn an optimal combination of domain-specific and shared representations from other domains automatically. Extensive experiments are conducted on the popular benchmark dataset namely FaceForeniscs++ for forgery classification. We report improvements over all the manipulation types in FaceForensics++ dataset and comparable results with state-of-the-art methods for cross-database evaluation on the Celeb-DF dataset and the Deepfake Detection Dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

A parametric model of the extracted signal is used to perform several image processing tasks. The cell component is used to identify interconnection lines between PV cells at sub-pixel accuracy, as well as to correct incorrect stitching of EL images. Furthermore, an explicit expression of the cell component signal is used to estimate the inverse characteristic length, a physical parameter related to the resistances in a PV module.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[How Shift Equivariance Impacts Metric Learning for Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05846v3)** | 2021-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metric learning has received conflicting assessments concerning its suitability for solving instance segmentation tasks. It has been dismissed as theoretically flawed due to the shift equivariance of the employed CNNs and their respective inability to distinguish same-looking objects. Yet it has been shown to yield state of the art results for a variety of tasks, and practical issues have mainly been reported in the context of tile-and-stitch approaches, where discontinuities at tile boundaries have been observed. To date, neither of the reported issues have undergone thorough formal analysis. In our work, we contribute a comprehensive formal analysis of the shift equivariance properties of encoder-decoder-style CNNs, which yields a clear picture of what can and cannot be achieved with metric learning in the face of same-looking objects. In particular, we prove that a standard encoder-decoder network that takes $d$-dimensional images as input, with $l$ pooling layers and pooling factor $f$, has the capacity to distinguish at most $f^{dl}$ same-looking objects, and we show that this upper limit can be reached. Furthermore, we show that to avoid discontinuities in a tile-and-stitch approach, assuming standard batch size 1, it is necessary to employ valid convolutions in combination with a training output window size strictly greater than $f^l$, while at test-time it is necessary to crop tiles to size $n\cdot f^l$ before stitching, with $n\geq 1$. We complement these theoretical findings by discussing a number of insightful special cases for which we show empirical results on synthetic data.</p></details> |  | None |

To defend against adversarial attacks in a training-free and attack-agnostic manner, this work proposes a novel and effective reconstruction-based defense framework by delving into deep image prior (DIP). Fundamentally different from existing reconstruction-based defenses, the proposed method analyzes and explicitly incorporates the model decision process into our defense. Given an adversarial image, firstly we map its reconstructed images during DIP optimization to the model decision space, where cross-boundary images can be detected and on-boundary images can be further localized. Then, adversarial noise is purified by perturbing on-boundary images along the reverse direction to the adversarial image. Finally, on-manifold images are stitched to construct an image that can be correctly predicted by the victim classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods both in defending white-box attacks and defense-aware attacks. Moreover, the proposed method can maintain a high visual quality during adversarial image reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be publish in ACM MM 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[A Robust Method for Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03860v3)** | 2021-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for large-scale image stitching that is robust against repetitive patterns and featureless regions in the imagery. In such cases, state-of-the-art image stitching methods easily produce image alignment artifacts, since they may produce false pairwise image registrations that are in conflict within the global connectivity graph. Our method augments the current methods by collecting all the plausible pairwise image registration candidates, among which globally consistent candidates are chosen. This enables the stitching process to determine the correct pairwise registrations by utilizing all the available information from the whole imagery, such as unambiguous registrations outside the repeating pattern and featureless regions. We formalize the method as a weighted multigraph whose nodes represent the individual image transformations from the composite image, and whose sets of multiple edges between two nodes represent all the plausible transformations between the pixel coordinates of the two images. The edge weights represent the plausibility of the transformations. The image transformations and the edge weights are solved from a non-linear minimization problem with linear constraints, for which a projection method is used. As an example, we apply the method in a large-scale scanning application where the transformations are primarily translations with only slight rotation and scaling component. Despite these simplifications, the state-of-the-art methods do not produce adequate results in such applications, since the image overlap is small, which can be featureless or repetitive, and misalignment artifacts and their concealment are unacceptable.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised Deep Image Stitching: Reconstructing Stitched Features to Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12859v1)** | 2021-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional feature-based image stitching technologies rely heavily on feature detection quality, often failing to stitch images with few features or low resolution. The learning-based image stitching solutions are rarely studied due to the lack of labeled data, making the supervised methods unreliable. To address the above limitations, we propose an unsupervised deep image stitching framework consisting of two stages: unsupervised coarse image alignment and unsupervised image reconstruction. In the first stage, we design an ablation-based loss to constrain an unsupervised homography network, which is more suitable for large-baseline scenes. Moreover, a transformer layer is introduced to warp the input images in the stitching-domain space. In the second stage, motivated by the insight that the misalignments in pixel-level can be eliminated to a certain extent in feature-level, we design an unsupervised image reconstruction network to eliminate the artifacts from features to pixels. Specifically, the reconstruction network can be implemented by a low-resolution deformation branch and a high-resolution refined branch, learning the deformation rules of image stitching and enhancing the resolution simultaneously. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, a comprehensive real-world image dataset for unsupervised deep image stitching is presented and released. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art solutions. Even compared with the supervised solutions, our image stitching quality is still preferred by users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> | None |

Our end-to-end, pixel-intensity-based approach jointly registers and stitches all the images by estimating a coaligned height map, which acts as a pixel-wise radial deformation field that orthorectifies each camera image to allow homographic registration. The height maps themselves are reparameterized as the output of an untrained encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) with the raw camera images as the input, which effectively removes many reconstruction artifacts. Our method also jointly estimates both the camera's dynamic 6D pose and its distortion using a nonparametric model, the latter of which is especially important in mesoscopic applications when using cameras not designed for imaging at short working distances, such as smartphone cameras. We also propose strategies for reducing computation time and memory, applicable to other multi-frame registration problems. Finally, we demonstrate our method using sequences of multi-megapixel images captured by an unstabilized smartphone on a variety of samples (e.g., painting brushstrokes, circuit board, seeds).</p></details> |  | None |

It presents a process pipeline that uses a feature-based stitching approach to create a distortion-free and true-to-life image from a video file. The developed process thus enables, for example, condition monitoring without having to view many individual images. For validation purposes, this will be demonstrated in the paper using the concrete example of a worn ball screw drive spindle. The developed algorithm aims at reproducing the functional principle of a line scan camera system, whereby the physical measuring systems are replaced by a feature-based approach. For evaluation of the stitching algorithms, metrics are used, some of which have only been developed in this work or have been supplemented by test procedures already in use. The applicability of the developed algorithm is not only limited to machine tool spindles. Instead, the developed method allows a general approach to the surface inspection of various rotationally symmetric components and can therefore be used in a variety of industrial applications. Deep-learning-based detection Algorithms can easily be implemented to generate a complete pipeline for failure detection and condition monitoring on rotationally symmetric parts.</p></details> | 9 pages, 13 figures | None |

In the field of computational pathology, where histology images are large in size and visual context is crucial, synthesis of large high resolution images via generative modeling is a challenging task. This is due to memory and computational constraints hindering the generation of large images. To address this challenge, we propose a novel SAFRON (Stitching Across the FRONtiers) framework to construct realistic, large high resolution tissue image tiles from ground truth annotations while preserving morphological features and with minimal boundary artifacts. We show that the proposed method can generate realistic image tiles of arbitrarily large size after training it on relatively small image patches. We demonstrate that our model can generate high quality images, both visually and in terms of the Frechet Inception Distance. Compared to other existing approaches, our framework is efficient in terms of the memory requirements for training and also in terms of the number of computations to construct a large high-resolution image. We also show that training on synthetic data generated by SAFRON can significantly boost the performance of a state-of-the-art algorithm for gland segmentation in colorectal cancer histology images.

| **[High-Resolution Deep Image Matting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06613v2)** | 2021-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image matting is a key technique for image and video editing and composition. Conventionally, deep learning approaches take the whole input image and an associated trimap to infer the alpha matte using convolutional neural networks. Such approaches set state-of-the-arts in image matting; however, they may fail in real-world matting applications due to hardware limitations, since real-world input images for matting are mostly of very high resolution. In this paper, we propose HDMatt, a first deep learning based image matting approach for high-resolution inputs. More concretely, HDMatt runs matting in a patch-based crop-and-stitch manner for high-resolution inputs with a novel module design to address the contextual dependency and consistency issues between different patches. Compared with vanilla patch-based inference which computes each patch independently, we explicitly model the cross-patch contextual dependency with a newly-proposed Cross-Patch Contextual module (CPC) guided by the given trimap. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its necessity for high-resolution inputs. Our HDMatt approach also sets new state-of-the-art performance on Adobe Image Matting and AlphaMatting benchmarks and produce impressive visual results on more real-world high-resolution images.</p></details> | AAAI 2021 | None |

The traditional methods heavily depend on the feature detection and require that scene features be dense and evenly distributed in the image, leading to varying ghosting effects and poor robustness. Learning methods usually suffer from fixed view and input size limitations, showing a lack of generalization ability on other real datasets. In this paper, we propose an image stitching learning framework, which consists of a large-baseline deep homography module and an edge-preserved deformation module. First, we propose a large-baseline deep homography module to estimate the accurate projective transformation between the reference image and the target image in different scales of features. After that, an edge-preserved deformation module is designed to learn the deformation rules of image stitching from edge to content, eliminating the ghosting effects as much as possible. In particular, the proposed learning framework can stitch images of arbitrary views and input sizes, thus contribute to a supervised deep image stitching method with excellent generalization capability in other real images. Experimental results demonstrate that our homography module significantly outperforms the existing deep homography methods in the large baseline scenes. In image stitching, our method is superior to the existing learning method and shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art traditional methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures | None |

Moreover, modern devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are equipped with an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) that can measure the gravity vector accurately. Using this prior, the y-axes of the cameras can be aligned or assumed to be already aligned, reducing their relative orientation to 1-DOF (degree of freedom). Exploiting this assumption, we propose new minimal solutions to panoramic image stitching of images taken by cameras with coinciding optical centers, i.e., undergoing pure rotation. We consider four practical camera configurations, assuming unknown fixed or varying focal length with or without radial distortion. The solvers are tested both on synthetic scenes and on more than 500k real image pairs from the Sun360 dataset and from scenes captured by us using two smartphones equipped with IMUs. It is shown, that they outperform the state-of-the-art both in terms of accuracy and processing time.</p></details> |  | None |

As described in [1], the seam finding phase attempts to place seams between pixels where the transition between source images is not noticeable. Here, we observe that the most problematic failures of this approach occur when objects are cropped, omitted, or duplicated. We therefore take an object-centered approach to the problem, leveraging recent advances in object detection [2,3,4]. We penalize candidate solutions with this class of error by modifying the energy function used in the seam finding stage. This produces substantially more realistic stitching results on challenging imagery. In addition, these methods can be used to determine when there is non-recoverable occlusion in the input data, and also suggest a simple evaluation metric that can be used to evaluate the output of stitching algorithms.</p></details> | ECCV 2018 | None |
| **[Robust image stitching with multiple registrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11784v1)** | 2020-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panorama creation is one of the most widely deployed techniques in computer vision. In addition to industry applications such as Google Street View, it is also used by millions of consumers in smartphones and other cameras. Traditionally, the problem is decomposed into three phases: registration, which picks a single transformation of each source image to align it to the other inputs, seam finding, which selects a source image for each pixel in the final result, and blending, which fixes minor visual artifacts. Here, we observe that the use of a single registration often leads to errors, especially in scenes with significant depth variation or object motion. We propose instead the use of multiple registrations, permitting regions of the image at different depths to be captured with greater accuracy. MRF inference techniques naturally extend to seam finding over multiple registrations, and we show here that their energy functions can be readily modified with new terms that discourage duplication and tearing, common problems that are exacerbated by the use of multiple registrations. Our techniques are closely related to layer-based stereo, and move image stitching closer to explicit scene modeling. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our techniques often generate significantly better panoramas when there is substantial motion or parallax.</p></details> | ECCV 2018 | None |
| **[More Informed Random Sample Consensus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09116v1)** | 2020-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random sample consensus (RANSAC) is a robust model-fitting algorithm. It is widely used in many fields including image-stitching and point cloud registration. In RANSAC, data is uniformly sampled for hypothesis generation. However, this uniform sampling strategy does not fully utilize all the information on many problems. In this paper, we propose a method that samples data with a L\'{e}vy distribution together with a data sorting algorithm. In the hypothesis sampling step of the proposed method, data is sorted with a sorting algorithm we proposed, which sorts data based on the likelihood of a data point being in the inlier set. Then, hypotheses are sampled from the sorted data with L\'{e}vy distribution. The proposed method is evaluated on both simulation and real-world public datasets. Our method shows better results compared with the uniform baseline method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, slide digitization is bottlenecked by the high cost of precise motor stages in slide scanners that are needed for position information used for slide stitching. We propose GloFlow, a two-stage method for creating a whole slide image using optical flow-based image registration with global alignment using a computationally tractable graph-pruning approach. In the first stage, we train an optical flow predictor to predict pairwise translations between successive video frames to approximate a stitch. In the second stage, this approximate stitch is used to create a neighborhood graph to produce a corrected stitch. On a simulated dataset of video scans of WSIs, we find that our method outperforms known approaches to slide-stitching, and stitches WSIs resembling those produced by slide scanners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) at NeurIPS 2020 - Extended Abstract</p></details> | None |

For the fusion of 3D points and image data, since a sparse depth map can be firstly generated by projecting LiDAR point onto the RGB image plane based on our reliable calibrated and synchronized sensors, we adopt a parameter self-adaptive framework to produce 2D dense depth map. For image stitching, optimal seamline for the overlapping area is searched using a graph-cuts-based method to alleviate the geometric influence and image blending based on the pyramid multi-band is utilized to eliminate the photometric effects near the stitching line. Since each pixel is associated with a depth value, we design this depth value as a radius in the spherical projection which can further project the panoramic image to the world coordinate and consequently produces a high-quality measurable panoramic image. The purposed method is tested on the data from our data collection platform and presents a satisfactory application prospects.</p></details> |  | None |

This algorithm expects multiple photos captured by fisheye lens cameras as input, and then, through the proposed algorithm, these photos can be merged into a high-quality 360-degree spherical panoramic image. For photos taken from a distant perspective, the parallax among them is relatively small, and the obtained panoramic image can be nearly seamless and undistorted. For photos taken from a close perspective or with a relatively large parallax, a seamless though partially distorted panoramic image can also be obtained. Besides, with the help of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), this algorithm can complete the whole stitching process at a very fast speed: typically, it only takes less than 30s to obtain a panoramic image of 9000-by-4000 pixels, which means our panorama stitching algorithm is of high value in many real-time applications.

Despite the high complexity of RS geometry, we focus in this paper on a special yet common input -- two consecutive frames from a video stream, wherein the inter-frame motion is restricted from being arbitrarily large. This allows us to adopt simpler differential motion model, leading to a straightforward and practical minimal solver. To deal with non-planar scene and camera parallax in stitching, we further propose an RS-aware spatially-varying homography field in the principle of As-Projective-As-Possible (APAP). We show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods both in RS image stitching and rectification, especially for images captured by hand-held shaking cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2020.

However, it is often affected by many practical factors which will degrade its performance. Among these factors, illumination variations are the most influential one, and especially no previous descriptor learning works focus on dealing with this problem. In this paper, we propose IF-Net, aimed to generate a robust and generic descriptor under crucial illumination changes conditions. We find out not only the kind of training data important but also the order it is presented. To this end, we investigate several dataset scheduling methods and propose a separation training scheme to improve the matching accuracy. Further, we propose a ROI loss and hard-positive mining strategy along with the training scheme, which can strengthen the ability of generated descriptor dealing with large illumination change conditions. We evaluate our approach on public patch matching benchmark and achieve the best results compared with several state-of-the-arts methods. To show the practicality, we further evaluate IF-Net on the task of visual localization under large illumination changes scenes, and achieves the best localization accuracy.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Image Stitching Based on Planar Region Consensus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02722v1)** | 2020-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching for two images without a global transformation between them is notoriously difficult. In this paper, noticing the importance of planar structure under perspective geometry, we propose a new image stitching method which stitches images by allowing for the alignment of a set of matched dominant planar regions. Clearly different from previous methods resorting to plane segmentation, the key to our approach is to utilize rich semantic information directly from RGB images to extract planar image regions with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We specifically design a new module to make fully use of existing semantic segmentation networks to accommodate planar segmentation. To train the network, a dataset for planar region segmentation is contributed. With the planar region knowledge, a set of local transformations can be obtained by constraining matched regions, enabling more precise alignment in the overlapping area. We also use planar knowledge to estimate a transformation field over the whole image. The final mosaic is obtained by a mesh-based optimization framework which maintains high alignment accuracy and relaxes similarity transformation at the same time. Extensive experiments with quantitative comparisons show that our method can deal with different situations and outperforms the state-of-the-arts on challenging scenes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures | None |

Collective behavior such as herding in farm animals, flocking of birds, and shoaling and schooling of fish provide information on its benefits on collective survival, fitness, reproductive patterns, group decision-making, and effects in animal epidemiology. In marine ethology, the investigation of behavioral patterns in schooling species can provide supplemental information in the planning and management of marine resources. Currently, damselfish species, although prevalent in tropical waters, have no adequate established base behavior information. This limits reef managers in efficiently planning for stress and disaster responses in protecting the reef. Visual marine data captured in the wild are scarce and prone to multiple scene variations, primarily caused by motion and changes in the natural environment. The gathered videos of damselfish by this research exhibit several scene distortions caused by erratic camera motions during acquisition. To effectively analyze shoaling behavior given the issues posed by capturing data in the wild, we propose a pre-processing system that utilizes color correction and image stitching techniques and extracts behavior features for manual analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, two new image features are proposed: the Information Ratio (IR) and the Mutual Information Ratio (MIR). The IR is a feature of a single image, while the MIR describes features common across two or more images.We begin by introducing the IR and the MIR and motivate these features in an information theoretical context as the ratio of the self-information of an intensity level over the information contained over the pixels of the same intensity. Notably, the relationship of the IR and MIR with the image entropy and mutual information, classic information measures, are discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of these features is tested through feature extraction over INRIA Copydays datasets and feature matching over the Oxfords Affine Covariant Regions. These numerical evaluations validate the relevance of the IR and MIR in practical computer vision tasks</p></details> | <details><summary>8-th ...</summary><p>8-th Iran Workshop on Communication and Information Theory, 2020</p></details> | None |
| **[Vanishing Point Guided Natural Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02478v1)** | 2020-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, works on improving the naturalness of stitching images gain more and more extensive attention. Previous methods suffer the failures of severe projective distortion and unnatural rotation, especially when the number of involved images is large or images cover a very wide field of view. In this paper, we propose a novel natural image stitching method, which takes into account the guidance of vanishing points to tackle the mentioned failures. Inspired by a vital observation that mutually orthogonal vanishing points in Manhattan world can provide really useful orientation clues, we design a scheme to effectively estimate prior of image similarity. Given such estimated prior as global similarity constraints, we feed it into a popular mesh deformation framework to achieve impressive natural stitching performances. Compared with other existing methods, including APAP, SPHP, AANAP, and GSP, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative experiments on natural image stitching.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures | None |
| **[Generating Embroidery Patterns Using Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02909v1)** | 2020-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many scenarios in computer vision, machine learning, and computer graphics, there is a requirement to learn the mapping from an image of one domain to an image of another domain, called Image-to-image translation. For example, style transfer, object transfiguration, visually altering the appearance of weather conditions in an image, changing the appearance of a day image into a night image or vice versa, photo enhancement, to name a few. In this paper, we propose two machine learning techniques to solve the embroidery image-to-image translation. Our goal is to generate a preview image which looks similar to an embroidered image, from a user-uploaded image. Our techniques are modifications of two existing techniques, neural style transfer, and cycle-consistent generative-adversarial network. Neural style transfer renders the semantic content of an image from one domain in the style of a different image in another domain, whereas a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network learns the mapping from an input image to output image without any paired training data, and also learn a loss function to train this mapping. Furthermore, the techniques we propose are independent of any embroidery attributes, such as elevation of the image, light-source, start, and endpoints of a stitch, type of stitch used, fabric type, etc. Given the user image, our techniques can generate a preview image which looks similar to an embroidered image. We train and test our propose techniques on an embroidery dataset which consist of simple 2D images. To do so, we prepare an unpaired embroidery dataset with more than 8000 user-uploaded images along with embroidered images. Empirical results show that these techniques successfully generate an approximate preview of an embroidered version of a user image, which can help users in decision making.</p></details> |  | None |

Image stitching is an equally prominent challenge in medical imaging, where the limited field-of-view captured by single images prohibits holistic analysis of patient anatomy. The barrier that prevents straight-forward mosaicing of 2D images is depth mismatch due to parallax. In this work, we leverage the Fourier slice theorem to aggregate information from multiple transmission images in parallax-free domains using fundamental principles of X-ray image formation. The semantics of the stitched image are restored using a novel deep learning strategy that exploits similarity measures designed around frequency, as well as dense and sparse spatial image content. Our pipeline, not only stitches images, but also provides orthographic reconstruction that enables metric measurements of clinically relevant quantities directly on the 2D image plane.</p></details> |  | None |

The differences between intra-patient images can be assessed quantitatively by registering serial acquisitions. Due to the variability of the images (i.e. contrast, luminosity) and the anatomical changes of the retina, the registration of fundus images remains a challenging task. Recently, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to register fundus images in an end-to-end fashion, achieving remarkable results. However, the results are difficult to interpret and analyze. In this work, we propose an imitation learning framework for the registration of 2D color funduscopic images for a wide range of applications such as disease monitoring, image stitching and super-resolution. We follow a divide-and-conquer approach to improve the interpretability of the proposed network, and analyze both the influence of the input image and the hyperparameters on the registration result. The results show that the proposed registration network reduces the initial target registration error up to 95\%.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures | None |

To achieve the goal, proper image reconstruction and image registration can be a valuable asset. In this paper, a new approach of the segmentation-based image surface reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct the surface of a breast phantom. In breast tissue, the sub-dermal vein network is used as a distinguishable pattern for reconstruction. The proposed image capturing device contacts the surface of the phantom, and surface deformation will occur due to applied force at the time of scanning. A novel force based surface rectification system is used to reconstruct a deformed surface image to its original structure. For the construction of the full surface from rectified images, advanced affine scale-invariant feature transform (A-SIFT) is proposed to reduce the affine effect in time when data capturing. Camera position based image stitching approach is applied to construct the final original non-rigid surface. The proposed model is validated in theoretical models and real scenarios, to demonstrate its advantages with respect to competing methods. The result of the proposed method, applied to path reconstruction, ends with a positioning accuracy of 99.7%</p></details> | 12 pages, 16 figures | None |

Furthermore, we propose a second network to correct the uneven illumination, further improving the readability and OCR accuracy. Due to the less complex distortion present on the smaller image patches, our patch-based approach followed by stitching and illumination correction can significantly improve the overall accuracy in both the synthetic and real datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures | None |

Poly-GAN allows conditioning on multiple inputs and is suitable for many tasks, including image alignment, image stitching, and inpainting. Existing methods have a similar pipeline where three different networks are used to first align garments with the human pose, then perform stitching of the aligned garment and finally refine the results. Poly-GAN is the first instance where a common architecture is used to perform all three tasks. Our novel architecture enforces the conditions at all layers of the encoder and utilizes skip connections from the coarse layers of the encoder to the respective layers of the decoder. Poly-GAN is able to perform a spatial transformation of the garment based on the RGB skeleton of the model at an arbitrary pose. Additionally, Poly-GAN can perform image stitching, regardless of the garment orientation, and inpainting on the garment mask when it contains irregular holes. Our system achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on Structural Similarity Index metric and Inception Score metric using the DeepFashion dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Once clocks are synchronized, the second stage initiates continuous image streaming, estimates the relative phase of image timestamps between each client and the leader, and shifts the streams into alignment. We quantitatively validate our results on a multi-camera rig imaging a high-precision LED array and qualitatively demonstrate significant improvements to multi-view stereo depth estimation and stitching of dynamic scenes.

Existing reassembly pipelines commonly consist of a local matching stage and a global compositions stage. In the local stage, a key challenge in fragment reassembly is to reliably compute and identify correct pairwise matching, for which most existing algorithms use handcrafted features, and hence, cannot reliably handle complicated puzzles. We build a deep convolutional neural network to detect the compatibility of a pairwise stitching, and use it to prune computed pairwise matches. To improve the network efficiency and accuracy, we transfer the calculation of CNN to the stitching region and apply a boost training strategy. In the global composition stage, we modify the commonly adopted greedy edge selection strategies to two new loop closure based searching algorithms. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods on solving various puzzles, especially those challenging ones with many fragment pieces.</p></details> |  | None |

In the past few years, the remote sensing community has observed Deep Neural Network (DNN) finally taking off in several challenging fields. In this study, we propose a DNN to generate a predefined High Resolution (HR) synthetic spectral band using an ensemble of concurrent Low Resolution (LR) bands and existing HR bands. Of particular interest, the proposed network, namely DeepSWIR, synthesizes Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) band at 5m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) using Green (G), Red (R) and Near InfraRed (NIR) bands at both 24m and 5m GSD, and SWIR band at 24m GSD. To our knowledge, the highest spatial resolution of commercially deliverable SWIR band is at 7.5m GSD. Also, we propose a Gaussian feathering based image stitching approach in light of processing large satellite imagery. To experimentally validate the synthesized HR SWIR band, we critically analyse the qualitative and quantitative results produced by DeepSWIR using state-of-the-art evaluation metrics. Further, we convert the synthesized DN values to Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and compare with the corresponding band of Sentinel-2B. Finally, we show one real world application of the synthesized band by using it to map wetland resources over our region of interest.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite various existing approaches for omnidirectional image stitching, how to quantitatively assess the quality of stitched images is still insufficiently explored. To address this problem, we establish a novel omnidirectional image dataset containing stitched images as well as dual-fisheye images captured from standard quarters of 0$^\circ$, 90$^\circ$, 180$^\circ$ and 270$^\circ$. In this manner, when evaluating the quality of an image stitched from a pair of fisheye images (e.g., 0$^\circ$ and 180$^\circ$), the other pair of fisheye images (e.g., 90$^\circ$ and 270$^\circ$) can be used as the cross-reference to provide ground-truth observations of the stitching regions. Based on this dataset, we further benchmark six widely used stitching models with seven evaluation metrics for IQA. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first dataset that focuses on assessing the stitching quality of omnidirectional images.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Stitching Videos from a Fisheye Lens Camera and a Wide-Angle Lens Camera for Telepresence Robots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06319v1)** | 2019-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many telepresence robots are equipped with a forward-facing camera for video communication and a downward-facing camera for navigation. In this paper, we propose to stitch videos from the FF-camera with a wide-angle lens and the DF-camera with a fisheye lens for telepresence robots. We aim at providing more compact and efficient visual feedback for the user interface of telepresence robots with user-friendly interactive experiences. To this end, we present a multi-homography-based video stitching method which stitches videos from a wide-angle camera and a fisheye camera. The method consists of video image alignment, seam cutting, and image blending. We directly align the wide-angle video image and the fisheye video image based on the multi-homography alignment without calibration, distortion correction, and unwarping procedures. Thus, we can obtain a stitched video with shape preservation in the non-overlapping regions and alignment in the overlapping area for telepresence. To alleviate ghosting effects caused by moving objects and/or moving cameras during telepresence robot driving, an optimal seam is found for aligned video composition, and the optimal seam will be updated in subsequent frames, considering spatial and temporal coherence. The final stitched video is created by image blending based on the optimal seam. We conducted a user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the superiority of telepresence robots with a stitched video as visual feedback.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Tiling and Stitching Segmentation Output for Remote Sensing: Basic Challenges and Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12219v3)** | 2019-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we consider the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pixel-wise labeling (a.k.a., semantic segmentation) of remote sensing imagery (e.g., aerial color or hyperspectral imagery). Remote sensing imagery is usually stored in the form of very large images, referred to as "tiles", which are too large to be segmented directly using most CNNs and their associated hardware. As a result, during label inference, smaller sub-images, called "patches", are processed individually and then "stitched" (concatenated) back together to create a tile-sized label map. This approach suffers from computational ineffiency and can result in discontinuities at output boundaries. We propose a simple alternative approach in which the input size of the CNN is dramatically increased only during label inference. This does not avoid stitching altogether, but substantially mitigates its limitations. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against a vonventional stitching approach using two popular segmentation CNN models and two large-scale remote sensing imagery datasets. The results suggest that the proposed approach substantially reduces label inference time, while also yielding modest overall label accuracy increases. This approach contributed to our wining entry (overall performance) in the INRIA building labeling competition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Content-Preserving Image Stitching with Regular Boundary Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11220v2)** | 2019-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an approach to content-preserving stitching of images with regular boundary constraints, which aims to stitch multiple images to generate a panoramic image with regular boundary. Existing methods treat image stitching and rectangling as two separate steps, which may result in suboptimal results as the stitching process is not aware of the further warping needs for rectangling. We address these limitations by formulating image stitching with regular boundaries in a unified optimization. Starting from the initial stitching results produced by traditional warping-based optimization, we obtain the irregular boundary from the warped meshes by polygon Boolean operations which robustly handle arbitrary mesh compositions, and by analyzing the irregular boundary construct a piecewise rectangular boundary. Based on this, we further incorporate straight line preserving and regular boundary constraints into the image stitching framework, and conduct iterative optimization to obtain an optimal piecewise rectangular boundary, thus can make the panoramic boundary as close as possible to a rectangle, while reducing unwanted distortions. We further extend our method to panoramic videos and selfie photography, by integrating the temporal coherence and portrait preservation into the optimization. Experiments show that our method efficiently produces visually pleasing panoramas with regular boundaries and unnoticeable distortions.</p></details> | 12 figures, 13 pages | None |

In this paper, we show that the warping quality can be significantly enhanced by exploiting the cross-channel correlation. We design a warping scheme that integrates intra-channel interpolation with cross-channel variation at very low computational cost, which is required for interactive multimedia applications on mobile devices. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are validated by extensive experiments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tattoo Image Search at Scale: Joint Detection and Compact Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00218v1)** | 2018-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive growth of digital images in video surveillance and social media has led to the significant need for efficient search of persons of interest in law enforcement and forensic applications. Despite tremendous progress in primary biometric traits (e.g., face and fingerprint) based person identification, a single biometric trait alone cannot meet the desired recognition accuracy in forensic scenarios. Tattoos, as one of the important soft biometric traits, have been found to be valuable for assisting in person identification. However, tattoo search in a large collection of unconstrained images remains a difficult problem, and existing tattoo search methods mainly focus on matching cropped tattoos, which is different from real application scenarios. To close the gap, we propose an efficient tattoo search approach that is able to learn tattoo detection and compact representation jointly in a single convolutional neural network (CNN) via multi-task learning. While the features in the backbone network are shared by both tattoo detection and compact representation learning, individual latent layers of each sub-network optimize the shared features toward the detection and feature learning tasks, respectively. We resolve the small batch size issue inside the joint tattoo detection and compact representation learning network via random image stitch and preceding feature buffering. We evaluate the proposed tattoo search system using multiple public-domain tattoo benchmarks, and a gallery set with about 300K distracter tattoo images compiled from these datasets and images from the Internet. In addition, we also introduce a tattoo sketch dataset containing 300 tattoos for sketch-based tattoo search. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has superior performance in tattoo detection and tattoo search at scale compared to several state-of-the-art tattoo retrieval algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report (15 pages, 14 figures)</p></details> | None |

With the development of video surveillance and the requirement for 3D converged video surveillance in smart cities, CPU and GPU are required to possess strong processing abilities to make panoramic video. The traditional panoramic products depend on post processing, which results in high power consumption, low stability and unsatisfying performance in real time. In order to solve these problems,we propose a real-time panoramic video stitching framework.The framework we propose mainly consists of three algorithms, LORB image feature extraction algorithm, feature point matching algorithm based on LSH and GPU parallel video stitching algorithm based on CUDA.The experiment results show that the algorithm mentioned can improve the performance in the stages of feature extraction of images stitching and matching, the running speed of which is 11 times than that of the traditional ORB algorithm and 639 times than that of the traditional SIFT algorithm. Based on analyzing the GPU resources occupancy rate of each resolution image stitching, we further propose a stream parallel strategy to maximize the utilization of GPU resources. Compared with the L-ORB algorithm, the efficiency of this strategy is improved by 1.6-2.5 times, and it can make full use of GPU resources. The performance of the system accomplished in the paper is 29.2 times than that of the former embedded one, while the power dissipation is reduced to 10W.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review for Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> | None |
| **[Generalized Content-Preserving Warps for Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06783v1)** | 2018-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local misalignment caused by global homography is a common issue in image stitching task. Content-Preserving Warping (CPW) is a typical method to deal with this issue, in which geometric and photometric constraints are imposed to guide the warping process. One of its essential condition however, is colour consistency, and an elusive goal in real world applications. In this paper, we propose a Generalized Content-Preserving Warping (GCPW) method to alleviate this problem. GCPW extends the original CPW by applying a colour model that expresses the colour transformation between images locally, thus meeting the photometric constraint requirements for effective image stitching. We combine the photometric and geometric constraints and jointly estimate the colour transformation and the warped mesh vertexes, simultaneously. We align images locally with an optimal grid mesh generated by our GCPW method. Experiments on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that our new method is robust to colour variations, outperforming other state-of-the-art CPW-based image stitching methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiple Combined Constraints for Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06706v1)** | 2018-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several approaches to image stitching use different constraints to estimate the motion model between image pairs. These constraints can be roughly divided into two categories: geometric constraints and photometric constraints. In this paper, geometric and photometric constraints are combined to improve the alignment quality, which is based on the observation that these two kinds of constraints are complementary. On the one hand, geometric constraints (e.g., point and line correspondences) are usually spatially biased and are insufficient in some extreme scenes, while photometric constraints are always evenly and densely distributed. On the other hand, photometric constraints are sensitive to displacements and are not suitable for images with large parallaxes, while geometric constraints are usually imposed by feature matching and are more robust to handle parallaxes. The proposed method therefore combines them together in an efficient mesh-based image warping framework. It achieves better alignment quality than methods only with geometric constraints, and can handle larger parallax than photometric-constraint-based method. Experimental results on various images illustrate that the proposed method outperforms representative state-of-the-art image stitching methods reported in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Feature-less Stitching of Cylindrical Tunnel](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10278v1)** | 2018-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional image stitching algorithms use transforms such as homography to combine different views of a scene. They usually work well when the scene is planar or when the camera is only rotated, keeping its position static. This severely limits their use in real world scenarios where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) potentially hovers around and flies in an enclosed area while rotating to capture a video sequence. We utilize known scene geometry along with recorded camera trajectory to create cylindrical images captured in a given environment such as a tunnel where the camera rotates around its center. The captured images of the inner surface of the given scene are combined to create a composite panoramic image that is textured onto a 3D geometrical object in Unity graphical engine to create an immersive environment for end users.</p></details> | 6 pages | None |
| **[Coarse-to-fine Seam Estimation for Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09578v1)** | 2018-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seam-cutting and seam-driven techniques have been proven effective for handling imperfect image series in image stitching. Generally, seam-driven is to utilize seam-cutting to find a best seam from one or finite alignment hypotheses based on a predefined seam quality metric. However, the quality metrics in most methods are defined to measure the average performance of the pixels on the seam without considering the relevance and variance among them. This may cause that the seam with the minimal measure is not optimal (perception-inconsistent) in human perception. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine seam estimation method which applies the evaluation in a different way. For pixels on the seam, we develop a patch-point evaluation algorithm concentrating more on the correlation and variation of them. The evaluations are then used to recalculate the difference map of the overlapping region and reestimate a stitching seam. This evaluation-reestimation procedure iterates until the current seam changes negligibly comparing with the previous seams. Experiments show that our proposed method can finally find a nearly perception-consistent seam after several iterations, which outperforms the conventional seam-cutting and other seam-driven methods.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures | None |

| **[Quasi-homography warps in image stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08006v2)** | 2018-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The naturalness of warps is gaining extensive attentions in image stitching. Recent warps such as SPHP and AANAP, use global similarity warps to mitigate projective distortion (which enlarges regions), however, they necessarily bring in perspective distortion (which generates inconsistencies). In this paper, we propose a novel quasi-homography warp, which effectively balances the perspective distortion against the projective distortion in the non-overlapping region to create a more natural-looking panorama. Our approach formulates the warp as the solution of a bivariate system, where perspective distortion and projective distortion are characterized as slope preservation and scale linearization respectively. Because our proposed warp only relies on a global homography, thus it is totally parameter-free. A comprehensive experiment shows that a quasi-homography warp outperforms some state-of-the-art warps in urban scenes, including homography, AutoStitch and SPHP. A user study demonstrates that it wins most users' favor, comparing to homography and SPHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Ratio-Preserving Half-Cylindrical Warps for Natural Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06655v1)** | 2018-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel warp for natural image stitching is proposed that utilizes the property of cylindrical warp and a horizontal pixel selection strategy. The proposed ratio-preserving half-cylindrical warp is a combination of homography and cylindrical warps which guarantees alignment by homography and possesses less projective distortion by cylindrical warp. Unlike previous approaches applying cylindrical warp before homography, we use partition lines to divide the image into different parts and apply homography in the overlapping region while a composition of homography and cylindrical warps in the non-overlapping region. The pixel selection strategy then samples the points in horizontal and reconstructs the image via interpolation to further reduce horizontal distortion by maintaining the ratio as similarity. With applying half-cylindrical warp and horizontal pixel selection, the projective distortion in vertical and horizontal is mitigated simultaneously. Experiments show that our warp is efficient and produces a more natural-looking stitched result than previous methods.</p></details> | 3 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[2D Reconstruction of Small Intestine's Interior Wall](http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05817v1)** | 2018-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Examining and interpreting of a large number of wireless endoscopic images from the gastrointestinal tract is a tiresome task for physicians. A practical solution is to automatically construct a two dimensional representation of the gastrointestinal tract for easy inspection. However, little has been done on wireless endoscopic image stitching, let alone systematic investigation. The proposed new wireless endoscopic image stitching method consists of two main steps to improve the accuracy and efficiency of image registration. First, the keypoints are extracted by Principle Component Analysis and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (PCA-SIFT) algorithm and refined with Maximum Likelihood Estimation SAmple Consensus (MLESAC) outlier removal to find the most reliable keypoints. Second, the optimal transformation parameters obtained from first step are fed to the Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) algorithm as an initial solution. With modified Marquardt-Levenberg search strategy in a multiscale framework, the NMI can find the optimal transformation parameters in the shortest time. The proposed methodology has been tested on two different datasets - one with real wireless endoscopic images and another with images obtained from Micro-Ball (a new wireless cubic endoscopy system with six image sensors). The results have demonstrated the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology both visually and quantitatively.</p></details> | Journal draft | None |

Compared to the multiple-perspective result, the single-perspective result excels in perspective consistency but suffers from projective distortion. In this paper, we propose two single-perspective warps for natural image stitching. The first one is a parametric warp, which is a combination of the as-projective-as-possible warp and the quasi-homography warp via dual-feature. The second one is a mesh-based warp, which is determined by optimizing a total energy function that simultaneously emphasizes different characteristics of the single-perspective warp, including alignment, naturalness, distortion and saliency. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the proposed warp outperforms some state-of-the-art warps, including homography, APAP, AutoStitch, SPHP and GSP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures | None |

Cell segmentation in these images is crucial for computational plant analysis and many automated methods have been proposed. However, variations in signal intensity across the image mitigate the effectiveness of those approaches with no easy way for user correction. We propose a web-based collaborative 3D image segmentation application, SEGMENT3D, to leverage automatic segmentation results. The image is divided into 3D tiles that can be either segmented interactively from scratch or corrected from a pre-existing segmentation. Individual segmentation results per tile are then automatically merged via consensus analysis and then stitched to complete the segmentation for the entire image stack. SEGMENT3D is a comprehensive application that can be applied to other 3D imaging modalities and general objects. It also provides an easy way to create supervised data to advance segmentation using machine learning models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Image Stitching by Line-guided Local Warping with Global Similarity Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07935v2)** | 2017-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-textured image stitching remains a challenging problem. It is difficult to achieve good alignment and it is easy to break image structures due to insufficient and unreliable point correspondences. Moreover, because of the viewpoint variations between multiple images, the stitched images suffer from projective distortions. To solve these problems, this paper presents a line-guided local warping method with a global similarity constraint for image stitching. Line features which serve well for geometric descriptions and scene constraints, are employed to guide image stitching accurately. On one hand, the line features are integrated into a local warping model through a designed weight function. On the other hand, line features are adopted to impose strong geometric constraints, including line correspondence and line colinearity, to improve the stitching performance through mesh optimization. To mitigate projective distortions, we adopt a global similarity constraint, which is integrated with the projective warps via a designed weight strategy. This constraint causes the final warp to slowly change from a projective to a similarity transformation across the image. Finally, the images undergo a two-stage alignment scheme that provides accurate alignment and reduces projective distortion. We evaluate our method on a series of images and compare it with several other methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a convincing stitching performance and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Images generated by the dual-fisheye cameras have limited overlap and hence require non-conventional stitching techniques to produce high-quality 360x180-degree panoramas. This paper introduces a novel method to align these images using interpolation grids based on rigid moving least squares. Furthermore, jitter is the critical issue arising when one applies the image-based stitching algorithms to video. It stems from the unconstrained movement of stitching boundary from one frame to another. Therefore, we also propose a new algorithm to maintain the temporal coherence of stitching boundary to provide jitter-free 360-degree videos. Results show that the method proposed in this paper can produce higher quality stitched images and videos than prior work.</p></details> | Preprint version | None |

Since the development of this technology, medical device companies and many research groups have made substantial progress in converting passive capsule endoscopes to robotic active capsule endoscopes with most of the functionality of current active flexible endoscopes. However, robotic capsule endoscopy still has some challenges. In particular, the use of such devices to generate a precise three-dimensional (3D) mapping of the entire inner organ remains an unsolved problem. Such global 3D maps of inner organs would help doctors to detect the location and size of diseased areas more accurately and intuitively, thus permitting more reliable diagnoses. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first complete pipeline for a complete 3D visual map reconstruction of the stomach. The proposed pipeline is modular and includes a preprocessing module, an image registration module, and a final shape-from-shading-based 3D reconstruction module; the 3D map is primarily generated by a combination of image stitching and shape-from-shading techniques, and is updated in a frame-by-frame iterative fashion via capsule motion inside the stomach. A comprehensive quantitative analysis of the proposed 3D reconstruction method is performed using an esophagus gastro duodenoscopy simulator, three different endoscopic cameras, and a 3D optical scanner.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies show that seam-cutting approaches can effectively relieve artifacts generated by local misalignment. Normally, seam-cutting is described in terms of energy minimization, however, few of existing methods consider human perception in their energy functions, which sometimes causes that a seam with minimum energy is not most invisible in the overlapping region. In this paper, we propose a novel perception-based energy function in the seam-cutting framework, which considers the nonlinearity and the nonuniformity of human perception in energy minimization. Our perception-based approach adopts a sigmoid metric to characterize the perception of color discrimination, and a saliency weight to simulate that human eyes incline to pay more attention to salient objects. In addition, our seam-cutting composition can be easily implemented into other stitching pipelines. Experiments show that our method outperforms the seam-cutting method of the normal energy function, and a user study demonstrates that our composed results are more consistent with human perception.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures | None |

Specifically, there are factors that must be addressed when merging multiple images into a single coherent one. While ortho-rectification can be done, it tends to be expensive and time consuming. Image stitching offers a more economical, low-tech approach. However direct application tends to fail for low-elevation imagery due to one or more factors including insufficient keypoints, parallax issues, and homogeneity of the surveyed area. This paper discusses these problems and possible solutions when using techniques such as image stitching and structure from motion for generating ortho-rectified imagery. These are presented in terms of actual Irish projects including the Boland's Mills building in Dublin's city centre, the Kilmoon Cross Farm, and the Richview buildings on the University College Dublin campus.

A significant challenge is the lack of training data, i.e., 2D images of humans annotated with 3D poses. Such data is necessary to train state-of-the-art CNN architectures. Here, we propose a solution to generate a large set of photorealistic synthetic images of humans with 3D pose annotations. We introduce an image-based synthesis engine that artificially augments a dataset of real images with 2D human pose annotations using 3D Motion Capture (MoCap) data. Given a candidate 3D pose our algorithm selects for each joint an image whose 2D pose locally matches the projected 3D pose. The selected images are then combined to generate a new synthetic image by stitching local image patches in a kinematically constrained manner. The resulting images are used to train an end-to-end CNN for full-body 3D pose estimation. We cluster the training data into a large number of pose classes and tackle pose estimation as a K-way classification problem. Such an approach is viable only with large training sets such as ours. Our method outperforms the state of the art in terms of 3D pose estimation in controlled environments (Human3.6M) and shows promising results for in-the-wild images (LSP). This demonstrates that CNNs trained on artificial images generalize well to real images.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, accepted to appear in NIPS 2016</p></details> | None |
| **[Correspondence Insertion for As-Projective-As-Possible Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07997v1)** | 2016-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially varying warps are increasingly popular for image alignment. In particular, as-projective-as-possible (APAP) warps have been proven effective for accurate panoramic stitching, especially in cases with significant depth parallax that defeat standard homographic warps. However, estimating spatially varying warps requires a sufficient number of feature matches. In image regions where feature detection or matching fail, the warp loses guidance and is unable to accurately model the true underlying warp, thus resulting in poor registration. In this paper, we propose a correspondence insertion method for APAP warps, with a focus on panoramic stitching. Our method automatically identifies misaligned regions, and inserts appropriate point correspondences to increase the flexibility of the warp and improve alignment. Unlike other warp varieties, the underlying projective regularization of APAP warps reduces overfitting and geometric distortion, despite increases to the warp complexity. Comparisons with recent techniques for parallax-tolerant image stitching demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Image stitching with perspective-preserving warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05019v1)** | 2016-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching algorithms often adopt the global transformation, such as homography, and work well for planar scenes or parallax free camera motions. However, these conditions are easily violated in practice. With casual camera motions, variable taken views, large depth change, or complex structures, it is a challenging task for stitching these images. The global transformation model often provides dreadful stitching results, such as misalignments or projective distortions, especially perspective distortion. To this end, we suggest a perspective-preserving warping for image stitching, which spatially combines local projective transformations and similarity transformation. By weighted combination scheme, our approach gradually extrapolates the local projective transformations of the overlapping regions into the non-overlapping regions, and thus the final warping can smoothly change from projective to similarity. The proposed method can provide satisfactory alignment accuracy as well as reduce the projective distortions and maintain the multi-perspective view. Experiments on a variety of challenging images confirm the efficiency of the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>ISPRS...</summary><p>ISPRS 2016 - XXIII ISPRS Congress: Prague, Czech Republic, 2016</p></details> | None |
| **[Stitching Stabilizer: Two-frame-stitching Video Stabilization for Embedded Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06678v1)** | 2016-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In conventional electronic video stabilization, the stabilized frame is obtained by cropping the input frame to cancel camera shake. While a small cropping size results in strong stabilization, it does not provide us satisfactory results from the viewpoint of image quality, because it narrows the angle of view. By fusing several frames, we can effectively expand the area of input frames, and achieve strong stabilization even with a large cropping size. Several methods for doing so have been studied. However, their computational costs are too high for embedded systems such as smartphones. We propose a simple, yet surprisingly effective algorithm, called the stitching stabilizer. It stitches only two frames together with a minimal computational cost. It can achieve real-time processes in embedded systems, for Full HD and 30 FPS videos. To clearly show the effect, we apply it to hyperlapse. Using several clips, we show it produces more strongly stabilized and natural results than the existing solutions from Microsoft and Instagram.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages.

| **[Defect Detection Techniques for Airbag Production Sewing Stages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07905v1)** | 2015-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Airbags are subject to strict quality control in order to ensure passengers safety. The quality of fabric and sewing thread influence the final product and therefore, sewing defects must be early and accurately detected, in order to remove the item from production. Airbag seams assembly can take various forms, using linear and circle primitives, with threads of different colors and length densities, creating lockstitch or double threads chainstitch. The paper presents a framework for the automatic detection of defects occurring during the airbag sewing stage. Types of defects as skipped stitch, missed stitch or superimposed seam for lockstitch and two threads chainstitch are detected and marked. Using image processing methods, the proposed framework follows the seams path and determines if a color pattern of the considered stitches is valid.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PanoSwarm: Collaborative and Synchronized Multi-Device Panoramic Photography](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01147v3)** | 2015-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taking a picture has been traditionally a one-persons task. In this paper we present a novel system that allows multiple mobile devices to work collaboratively in a synchronized fashion to capture a panorama of a highly dynamic scene, creating an entirely new photography experience that encourages social interactions and teamwork. Our system contains two components: a client app that runs on all participating devices, and a server program that monitors and communicates with each device. In a capturing session, the server collects in realtime the viewfinder images of all devices and stitches them on-the-fly to create a panorama preview, which is then streamed to all devices as visual guidance. The system also allows one camera to be the host and to send direct visual instructions to others to guide camera adjustment. When ready, all devices take pictures at the same time for panorama stitching. Our preliminary study suggests that the proposed system can help users capture high quality panoramas with an enjoyable teamwork experience. A demo video of the system in action is provided at http://youtu.be/PwQ6k_ZEQSs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Understanding image representations by measuring their equivariance and equivalence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5908v2)** | 2015-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the importance of image representations such as histograms of oriented gradients and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), our theoretical understanding of them remains limited. Aiming at filling this gap, we investigate three key mathematical properties of representations: equivariance, invariance, and equivalence. Equivariance studies how transformations of the input image are encoded by the representation, invariance being a special case where a transformation has no effect. Equivalence studies whether two representations, for example two different parametrisations of a CNN, capture the same visual information or not. A number of methods to establish these properties empirically are proposed, including introducing transformation and stitching layers in CNNs. These methods are then applied to popular representations to reveal insightful aspects of their structure, including clarifying at which layers in a CNN certain geometric invariances are achieved. While the focus of the paper is theoretical, direct applications to structured-output regression are demonstrated too.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Tiered Move-making Algorithm for General Non-submodular Pairwise Energies](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6275v1)** | 2014-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large number of problems in computer vision can be modelled as energy minimization problems in a Markov Random Field (MRF) or Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. Graph-cuts based $\alpha$-expansion is a standard move-making method to minimize the energy functions with sub-modular pairwise terms. However, certain problems require more complex pairwise terms where the $\alpha$-expansion method is generally not applicable. In this paper, we propose an iterative {\em tiered move making algorithm} which is able to handle general pairwise terms. Each move to the next configuration is based on the current labeling and an optimal tiered move, where each tiered move requires one application of the dynamic programming based tiered labeling method introduced in Felzenszwalb et. al. \cite{tiered_cvpr_felzenszwalbV10}. The algorithm converges to a local minimum for any general pairwise potential, and we give a theoretical analysis of the properties of the algorithm, characterizing the situations in which we can expect good performance. We first evaluate our method on an object-class segmentation problem using the Pascal VOC-11 segmentation dataset where we learn general pairwise terms. Further we evaluate the algorithm on many other benchmark labeling problems such as stereo, image segmentation, image stitching and image denoising. Our method consistently gets better accuracy and energy values than alpha-expansion, loopy belief propagation (LBP), quadratic pseudo-boolean optimization (QPBO), and is competitive with TRWS.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Combinatorial Continuous Maximal Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2733v2)** | 2011-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum flow (and minimum cut) algorithms have had a strong impact on computer vision. In particular, graph cuts algorithms provide a mechanism for the discrete optimization of an energy functional which has been used in a variety of applications such as image segmentation, stereo, image stitching and texture synthesis. Algorithms based on the classical formulation of max-flow defined on a graph are known to exhibit metrication artefacts in the solution. Therefore, a recent trend has been to instead employ a spatially continuous maximum flow (or the dual min-cut problem) in these same applications to produce solutions with no metrication errors. However, known fast continuous max-flow algorithms have no stopping criteria or have not been proved to converge. In this work, we revisit the continuous max-flow problem and show that the analogous discrete formulation is different from the classical max-flow problem. We then apply an appropriate combinatorial optimization technique to this combinatorial continuous max-flow CCMF problem to find a null-divergence solution that exhibits no metrication artefacts and may be solved exactly by a fast, efficient algorithm with provable convergence. Finally, by exhibiting the dual problem of our CCMF formulation, we clarify the fact, already proved by Nozawa in the continuous setting, that the max-flow and the total variation problems are not always equivalent.</p></details> | 26 pages | None |
