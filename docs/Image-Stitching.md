| **[A Stitch in Time: Learning Procedural Workflow via Self-Supervised Plackett-Luce Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17805v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Procedural activities, ranging from routine cooking to complex surgical operations, are highly structured as a set of actions conducted in a specific temporal order. Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.</p></details> | 18 pages | None |

Although the ISS position at capture time is known precisely, the specific Earth locations depicted in these images are typically not directly georeferenced, making automated localization non-trivial. ISS-Geo142 consists of 142 images with associated metadata and manually determined geographic locations, spanning a range of spatial scales and scene types. On top of this benchmark, we implement and evaluate three geolocation pipelines: a neural network based approach (NN-Geo) using VGG16 features and cross-correlation over map-derived Areas of Interest (AOIs), a Scale-Invariant Feature Transform based pipeline (SIFT-Match) using sliding-window feature matching on stitched high-resolution AOIs, and TerraByte, an AI system built around a GPT-4 model with vision capabilities that jointly reasons over image content and ISS coordinates. On ISS-Geo142, NN-Geo achieves a match for 75.52\% of the images under our evaluation protocol, SIFT-Match attains high precision on structurally rich scenes at substantial computational cost, and TerraByte establishes the strongest overall baseline, correctly geolocating approximately 90\% of the images while also producing human-readable geographic descriptions. The methods and experiments were originally developed in 2023; this manuscript is a revised and extended version that situates the work relative to subsequent advances in cross-view geo-localization and remote-sensing vision--language models. Taken together, ISS-Geo142 and these three pipelines provide a concrete, historically grounded benchmark for future work on ISS image geolocation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SemanticStitch: Enhancing Image Coherence through Foreground-Aware Seam Carving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12084v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching often faces challenges due to varying capture angles, positional differences, and object movements, leading to misalignments and visual discrepancies. Traditional seam carving methods neglect semantic information, causing disruptions in foreground continuity. We introduce SemanticStitch, a deep learning-based framework that incorporates semantic priors of foreground objects to preserve their integrity and enhance visual coherence. Our approach includes a novel loss function that emphasizes the semantic integrity of salient objects, significantly improving stitching quality. We also present two specialized real-world datasets to evaluate our method's effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional techniques, providing robust support for practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12pag...</summary><p>12pages, has been early accepted by The Visual Computer: International Journal of Computer Graphics, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[CrochetBench: Can Vision-Language Models Move from Describing to Doing in Crochet Domain?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09483v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

| **[Aerial Image Stitching Using IMU Data from a UAV](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06841v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for aerial photography and remote sensing applications. One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Depth-Supervised Fusion Network for Seamless-Free Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21396v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in the stitched results. To address this, we propose a depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against the existing methods.

| **[Free$^2$Guide: Training-Free Text-to-Video Alignment using Image LVLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17041v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks for text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, achieving accurate text alignment in T2V generation remains challenging due to the complex temporal dependencies across frames. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to enhance text alignment often require differentiable reward functions trained for videos, hindering their scalability and applicability. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Free$^2$Guide}, a novel gradient-free and training-free framework for aligning generated videos with text prompts. Specifically, leveraging principles from path integral control, Free$^2$Guide approximates guidance for diffusion models using non-differentiable reward functions, thereby enabling the integration of powerful black-box Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as reward models. To enable image-trained LVLMs to assess text-to-video alignment, we leverage \textit{stitching} between video frames and use system prompts to capture sequential attributions. Our framework supports the flexible ensembling of multiple reward models to synergistically enhance alignment without significant computational overhead. Experimental results confirm that Free$^2$Guide using image-trained LVLMs significantly improves text-to-video alignment, thereby enhancing the overall video quality. Our results and code are available at https://kjm981995.github.io/free2guide/</p></details> | ICCV 2025 accepted | [Code Link](https://kjm981995.github.io/free2guide) |
| **[Stitch: Training-Free Position Control in Multimodal Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26644v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years, but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models. We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top models still have significant room for improvement in position-based generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206% on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while integrating position control into leading models training-free.

| **[Efficient Encoder-Free Pose Conditioning and Pose Control for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20343v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON) technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control. In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[One-shot Embroidery Customization via Contrastive LoRA Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18948v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques, and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties, which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation. Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer, we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and appearance transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), SIGGRAPH Asia 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[A Generalization of CLAP from 3D Localization to Image Processing, A Connection With RANSAC & Hough Transforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13605v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In previous work, we introduced a 2D localization algorithm called CLAP, Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which was used during our championship win in RoboCup 2024, an international autonomous humanoid soccer competition. CLAP is particularly recognized for its robustness against outliers, where clustering is employed to suppress noise and mitigate against erroneous feature matches. This clustering-based strategy provides an alternative to traditional outlier rejection schemes such as RANSAC, in which candidates are validated by reprojection error across all data points. In this paper, CLAP is extended to a more general framework beyond 2D localization, specifically to 3D localization and image stitching. We also show how CLAP, RANSAC, and Hough transforms are related. The generalization of CLAP is widely applicable to many different fields and can be a useful tool to deal with noise and uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Offline RLAIF: Piloting VLM Feedback for RL via SFO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01062v6)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called Sub-Trajectory Filtered Optimization (SFO). We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex RLHF-based methods. We propose Sub-Trajectory Filtered Behavior Cloning (SFBC), a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence.

| **[Generating Transferrable Adversarial Examples via Local Mixing and Logits Optimization for Remote Sensing Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07495v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness. Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore, their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut, which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average improvement in black-box attack success rate.</p></details> |  | None |

However, reviewing lengthy video footage is impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Interpreting the linear structure of vision-language model embedding spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11695v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2, and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings, while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly, while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality, yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how multimodal meaning is constructed.</p></details> | COLM 2025 | None |
| **[Marmot: Object-Level Self-Correction via Multi-Agent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this, CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple vehicle configurations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |

Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays, and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.</p></details> | PhD thesis | None |

We introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence. Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of unlimited duration.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Robust Image Stitching with Optimal Plane](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05903v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of \textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes. Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness.

| **[PIS3R: Very Large Parallax Image Stitching via Deep 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04236v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  | None |

A unified, training-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open challenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference, ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it is the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment transfer across multiple individuals in a single scene.

| **[(Almost) Free Modality Stitching of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10015v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module that aims to align the representation spaces of these uni-modal models towards a multi-modal objective. However, given the complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the cost of searching for the best performing uni-modal model pair by $10\times$, while matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.</p></details> | Pre-print | None |
| **[Hallucinating 360°: Panoramic Street-View Generation via Local Scenes Diffusion and Probabilistic Prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06971v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360° surround view in a single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models.

| **[Generative Panoramic Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07133v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting, camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CAT: A Conditional Adaptation Tailor for Efficient and Effective Instance-Specific Pansharpening on Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10242v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pansharpening is a crucial remote sensing technique that fuses low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images with high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) imagery. Although deep learning techniques have significantly advanced pansharpening, many existing methods suffer from limited cross-sensor generalization and high computational overhead, restricting their real-time applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient framework that quickly adapts to a specific input instance, completing both training and inference in a short time. Our framework splits the input image into multiple patches, selects a subset for unsupervised CAT training, and then performs inference on all patches, stitching them into the final output. The CAT module, integrated between the feature extraction and channel transformation stages of a pre-trained network, tailors the fused features and fixes the parameters for efficient inference, generating improved results. Our approach offers two key advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: by mitigating cross-sensor degradation, our model--although pre-trained on a specific dataset--achieves superior performance on datasets captured by other sensors; (2) $\textit{Enhanced Computational Efficiency}$: the CAT-enhanced network can swiftly adapt to the test sample using the single LRMS-PAN pair input, without requiring extensive large-scale data retraining. Experiments on the real-world data from WorldView-3 and WorldView-2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-sensor real-world data, while achieving both training and inference of $512\times512$ image within $\textit{0.4 seconds}$ and $4000\times4000$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiple Object Stitching for Unsupervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07364v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence, compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations. In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised representation performance on both single object centric images and multi-object ones.

| **[VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03614v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe." We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID: we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch}, \texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference. Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks.

Our contribution includes constructing a dataset of image-sketch pairs, the images for which are from the Zurich Building Database, and sketches have been generated by us. We use this dataset to train a CycleGAN for our pipeline's second step. We end up with a stitching process that does not generalize well to real drawings, but the rest of the pipeline that creates a 3D reconstruction from a single sketch performs quite well on a wide variety of drawings.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures, paper dated December 12, 2018</p></details> | None |

We show how to practically model this formalism by using a new conditional U-Net architecture, which fully takes into account the conditional information and does not need any fixed image. Our formalism is then applied to image moving tumors for radiotherapy treatment at different breathing amplitude using 4D-CT (3D+t) scans in thoracoabdominal regions. This driving application is particularly complex as it requires to stitch a collection of sequential 2D slices into several 3D volumes at different organ positions. Movement interpolation with standard methods then generates well known reconstruction artefacts in the assembled volumes due to irregular patient breathing, hysteresis and poor correlation of breathing signal to internal motion. Results obtained on 4D-CT clinical data showcase artefact-free volumes achieved through real-time latencies.

Leveraging advanced architectural enhancements and efficient computational strategies, Flash-VL 2B is designed to maximize throughput by reducing processing time while maintaining competitive performance across multiple vision-language benchmarks. Our approach includes tailored architectural choices, token compression mechanisms, data curation, training schemes, and a novel image processing technique called implicit semantic stitching that effectively balances computational load and model performance. Through extensive evaluations on 11 standard VLM benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flash-VL 2B achieves state-of-the-art results in both speed and accuracy, making it a promising solution for deployment in resource-constrained environments and large-scale real-time applications.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures | None |

To address the lack of ground truth in current multi-modal image registration and fusion methods, we propose a novel self-supervised \textbf{B}i-directional \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{R}egistration framework (\textbf{B-SR}). Specifically, B-SR utilizes a proxy data generator (PDG) and an inverse proxy data generator (IPDG) to achieve self-supervised global-local registration. Visible-infrared image pairs with spatially misaligned differences are aligned to obtain global differences through the registration module. The same image pairs are processed by PDG, such as cropping, flipping, stitching, etc., and then aligned to obtain local differences. IPDG converts the obtained local differences into pseudo-global differences, which are used to perform global-local difference consistency with the global differences. Furthermore, aiming at eliminating the effect of modal gaps on the registration module, we design a neighborhood dynamic alignment loss to achieve cross-modal image edge alignment. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in multi-modal image alignment and fusion against the competing methods.

Specifically, StableMotion framework takes text-to-image Stable Diffusion (SD) models as backbone and repurposes it into an image-to-motion estimator. To mitigate inconsistent output produced by diffusion models, we propose Adaptive Ensemble Strategy (AES) that consolidates multiple outputs into a cohesive, high-fidelity result. Additionally, we present the concept of Sampling Steps Disaster (SSD), the counterintuitive scenario where increasing the number of sampling steps can lead to poorer outcomes, which enables our framework to achieve one-step inference. StableMotion is verified on two image rectification tasks and delivers state-of-the-art performance in both, as well as showing strong generalizability. Supported by SSD, StableMotion offers a speedup of 200 times compared to previous diffusion model-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Even if the input videos are stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment, trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes. Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in this field by building a real-time online video stitching system.</p></details> | <details><summary>TPAMI...</summary><p>TPAMI2025; https://github.com/nie-lang/StabStitch2. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.06378</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/nie-lang/StabStitch2) |

Vector-based representation encodes a sewing pattern as a discrete set of panels, each defined as a sequence of lines and curves, stitching information between panels and the placement of each panel around a body. However, this representation causes two major challenges for neural networks: discontinuity in latent space between patterns with different topologies and limited generalization to garments with unseen topologies in the training data. In this work, we introduce GarmentImage, a unified raster-based sewing pattern representation. GarmentImage encodes a garment sewing pattern's geometry, topology and placement into multi-channel regular grids. Machine learning models trained on GarmentImage achieve seamless transitions between patterns with different topologies and show better generalization capabilities compared to models trained on vector-based representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GarmentImage across three applications: pattern exploration in latent space, text-based pattern editing, and image-to-pattern prediction. The results show that GarmentImage achieves superior performance on these applications using only simple convolutional networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, SIGGRAPH 2025 (Conference Track)</p></details> | None |

Panoramic images offer a 360$\times$ 180 field of view (FoV), capturing the entire scene in a single shot. However, panoramic images introduce severe distortion, making it challenging to render 3D Gaussians into 2D distorted equirectangular space directly. Converting equirectangular images to cubemap projections partially alleviates this problem but introduces new challenges, such as projection distortion and discontinuities across cube-face boundaries. To address these limitations, we present a novel framework, named TPGS, to bridge continuous panoramic 3D scene reconstruction with perspective Gaussian splatting. Firstly, we introduce a Transition Plane between adjacent cube faces to enable smoother transitions in splatting directions and mitigate optimization ambiguity in the boundary region. Moreover, an intra-to-inter face optimization strategy is proposed to enhance local details and restore visual consistency across cube-face boundaries. Specifically, we optimize 3D Gaussians within individual cube faces and then fine-tune them in the stitched panoramic space. Additionally, we introduce a spherical sampling technique to eliminate visible stitching seams. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor, egocentric, and roaming benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing uni-modal sewing pattern generation models struggle to effectively encode complex design concepts with a multi-modal nature and correlate them with vectorized sewing patterns that possess precise geometric structures and intricate sewing relations. In this work, we propose a novel sewing pattern generation approach \textbf{Design2GarmentCode} based on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), to generate parametric pattern-making programs from multi-modal design concepts. LMM offers an intuitive interface for interpreting diverse design inputs, while pattern-making programs could serve as well-structured and semantically meaningful representations of sewing patterns, and act as a robust bridge connecting the cross-domain pattern-making knowledge embedded in LMMs with vectorized sewing patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can flexibly handle various complex design expressions such as images, textual descriptions, designer sketches, or their combinations, and convert them into size-precise sewing patterns with correct stitches. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly enhances training efficiency, generation quality, and authoring flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2025)</p></details> | None |

However, agricultural images can be particularly challenging to stitch because feature matching across images is difficult due to repeated textures, plants are non-planar, and mosaics built from many images can accumulate errors that cause drift. Although these issues can be mitigated by using georeferenced images or taking images at high altitude, there is no general solution for images taken close to the crop. To address this, we created a user-friendly and open source pipeline for stitching ground-based images of a linear row of crops that does not rely on additional data. First, we use SuperPoint and LightGlue to extract and match features within small batches of images. Then we stitch the images in each batch in series while imposing constraints on the camera movement. After straightening and rescaling each batch mosaic, all batch mosaics are stitched together in series and then straightened into a final mosaic. We tested the pipeline on images collected along 72 m long rows of crops using two different agricultural robots and a camera manually carried over the row. In all three cases, the pipeline produced high-quality mosaics that could be used to georeference real world positions with a mean absolute error of 20 cm. This approach provides accessible leaf-scale stitching to users who need to coarsely georeference positions within a row, but do not have access to accurate positional data or sophisticated imaging systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Although omnidirectional images are becoming more popular since they reduce the computation required for image stitching to composite a holistic scene, existing feed-forward models are only designed for perspective images. The unique optical properties of omnidirectional images make it difficult for feature encoders to correctly understand the context of the image and make the Gaussian non-uniform in space, which hinders the image quality synthesized from novel views. We propose OmniSplat, a training-free fast feed-forward 3DGS generation framework for omnidirectional images. We adopt a Yin-Yang grid and decompose images based on it to reduce the domain gap between omnidirectional and perspective images. The Yin-Yang grid can use the existing CNN structure as it is, but its quasi-uniform characteristic allows the decomposed image to be similar to a perspective image, so it can exploit the strong prior knowledge of the learned feed-forward network. OmniSplat demonstrates higher reconstruction accuracy than existing feed-forward networks trained on perspective images.

We propose indicators to detect normalization issues and further explore the trade-offs between artifact-free and high-quality predictions, using three diverse microscopy datasets as examples. Finally, we propose to use BatchRenorm as the most suitable normalization strategy, which effectively removes tiling artifacts and enhances transfer performance, thereby improving the reusability of trained networks for new datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work we address both of these challenges with a spherical neural light field model for implicit panoramic image stitching and re-rendering; able to accommodate for depth parallax, view-dependent lighting, and local scene motion and color changes during capture. Fit during test-time to an arbitrary path panoramic video capture -- vertical, horizontal, random-walk -- these neural light spheres jointly estimate the camera path and a high-resolution scene reconstruction to produce novel wide field-of-view projections of the environment. Our single-layer model avoids expensive volumetric sampling, and decomposes the scene into compact view-dependent ray offset and color components, with a total model size of 80 MB per scene, and real-time (50 FPS) rendering at 1080p resolution. We demonstrate improved reconstruction quality over traditional image stitching and radiance field methods, with significantly higher tolerance to scene motion and non-ideal capture settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project site: https://light.princeton.edu/publication/neuls/</p></details> | None |

Whole-body image translation presents challenges due to anatomical heterogeneity, often limiting generalized models. We propose a framework that segments whole-body CT images into four regions-head, trunk, arms, and legs-and uses district-specific Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for tailored CT-to-PET translation. Synthetic PET images from each region are stitched together to reconstruct the whole-body scan. Comparisons with a baseline non-segmented GAN and experiments with Pix2Pix and CycleGAN architectures tested paired and unpaired scenarios.

| **[Video Depth without Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19189v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video depth estimation lifts monocular video clips to 3D by inferring dense depth at every frame. Recent advances in single-image depth estimation, brought about by the rise of large foundation models and the use of synthetic training data, have fueled a renewed interest in video depth. However, naively applying a single-image depth estimator to every frame of a video disregards temporal continuity, which not only leads to flickering but may also break when camera motion causes sudden changes in depth range. An obvious and principled solution would be to build on top of video foundation models, but these come with their own limitations; including expensive training and inference, imperfect 3D consistency, and stitching routines for the fixed-length (short) outputs. We take a step back and demonstrate how to turn a single-image latent diffusion model (LDM) into a state-of-the-art video depth estimator. Our model, which we call RollingDepth, has two main ingredients: (i) a multi-frame depth estimator that is derived from a single-image LDM and maps very short video snippets (typically frame triplets) to depth snippets. (ii) a robust, optimization-based registration algorithm that optimally assembles depth snippets sampled at various different frame rates back into a consistent video. RollingDepth is able to efficiently handle long videos with hundreds of frames and delivers more accurate depth videos than both dedicated video depth estimators and high-performing single-frame models.

However, the field of microscopy often encounters limitations in field-of-view (FOV), restricting the amount of sample that can be imaged in a single capture. To overcome this limitation, image stitching techniques have been developed to seamlessly merge multiple overlapping images into a single, high-resolution composite. The images collected from microscope need to be optimally stitched before accurate physical information can be extracted from post analysis. However, the existing stitching tools either struggle to stitch images together when the microscopy images are feature sparse or cannot address all the transformations of images. To address these issues, we propose a bi-channel aided feature-based image stitching method and demonstrate its use on AFM generated biofilm images. The topographical channel image of AFM data captures the morphological details of the sample, and a stitched topographical image is desired for researchers. We utilize the amplitude channel of AFM data to maximize the matching features and to estimate the position of the original topographical images and show that the proposed bi-channel aided stitching method outperforms the traditional stitching approach. Furthermore, we found that the differentiation of the topographical images along the x-axis provides similar feature information to the amplitude channel image, which generalizes our approach when the amplitude images are not available. Here we demonstrated the application on AFM, but similar approaches could be employed of optical microscopy with brightfield and fluorescence channels. We believe this proposed workflow will benefit the experimentalist to avoid erroneous analysis and discovery due to incorrect stitching.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has 21 pages with 8 figures in main-text and 2 figures in Supplementary materials</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes an approach to coalesce existing generative systems to form a stereoscopic virtual reality video from text. Carried out in three main stages, we start with a base text-to-image model that captures context from an input text. We then employ Stable Diffusion on the rudimentary image produced, to generate frames with enhanced realism and overall quality. These frames are processed with depth estimation algorithms to create left-eye and right-eye views, which are stitched side-by-side to create an immersive viewing experience. Such systems would be highly beneficial in virtual reality production, since filming and scene building often require extensive hours of work and post-production effort. We utilize image evaluation techniques, specifically Fréchet Inception Distance and CLIP Score, to assess the visual quality of frames produced for the video. These quantitative measures establish the proficiency of the proposed method. Our work highlights the exciting possibilities of using natural language-driven graphics in fields like virtual reality simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Co-au...</summary><p>Co-authors do not consent to publishing on Arxiv</p></details> | None |

To tackle this problem, we propose the Reference-Driven Inpainting Stitcher (RDIStitcher), which reformulates the image fusion and rectangling as a reference-based inpainting model, incorporating a larger modification fusion area and stronger modification intensity than previous methods. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised model training method, which enables the implementation of RDIStitcher without requiring labeled data by fine-tuning a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model. Recognizing difficulties in assessing the quality of stitched images, we present the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)-based metrics, offering a new perspective on evaluating stitched image quality. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances content coherence and seamless transitions in the stitched images. Especially in the zero-shot experiments, our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

However, they often underperform in specialised domains like medical imaging, where domain-specific solutions or alternative knowledge transfer approaches are typically required. Recent studies have noted that general-purpose models can exhibit similar latent spaces when processing semantically related data, although this alignment does not occur naturally. Building on this insight, it has been shown that applying a simple transformation - at most affine - estimated from a subset of semantically corresponding samples, known as anchors, enables model stitching across diverse training paradigms, architectures, and modalities. In this paper, we explore how semantic alignment - estimating transformations between anchors - can bridge general-purpose AI with specialised medical knowledge. Using multiple public chest X-ray datasets, we demonstrate that model stitching across model architectures allows general models to integrate domain-specific knowledge without additional training, leading to improved performance on medical tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel zero-shot classification approach for unimodal vision encoders that leverages semantic alignment across modalities. Our results show that our method not only outperforms general multimodal models but also approaches the performance levels of fully trained, medical-specific multimodal solutions</p></details> |  | None |

Instead of following mainstream diffusion-based methods, we explore and extend the potential of the implicit-keypoint-based framework, which effectively balances computational efficiency and controllability. Building upon this, we develop a video-driven portrait animation framework named LivePortrait with a focus on better generalization, controllability, and efficiency for practical usage. To enhance the generation quality and generalization ability, we scale up the training data to about 69 million high-quality frames, adopt a mixed image-video training strategy, upgrade the network architecture, and design better motion transformation and optimization objectives. Additionally, we discover that compact implicit keypoints can effectively represent a kind of blendshapes and meticulously propose a stitching and two retargeting modules, which utilize a small MLP with negligible computational overhead, to enhance the controllability. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework even compared to diffusion-based methods. The generation speed remarkably reaches 12.8ms on an RTX 4090 GPU with PyTorch.

| **[Continuous Patch Stitching for Block-wise Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16795v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most recently, learned image compression methods have outpaced traditional hand-crafted standard codecs. However, their inference typically requires to input the whole image at the cost of heavy computing resources, especially for high-resolution image compression; otherwise, the block artefact can exist when compressed by blocks within existing learned image compression methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel continuous patch stitching (CPS) framework for block-wise image compression that is able to achieve seamlessly patch stitching and mathematically eliminate block artefact, thus capable of significantly reducing the required computing resources when compressing images. More specifically, the proposed CPS framework is achieved by padding-free operations throughout, with a newly established parallel overlapping stitching strategy to provide a general upper bound for ensuring the continuity. Upon this, we further propose functional residual blocks with even-sized kernels to achieve down-sampling and up-sampling, together with bottleneck residual blocks retaining feature size to increase network depth. Experimental results demonstrate that our CPS framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance against existing baselines, whilst requiring less than half of computing resources of existing models. Our code shall be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 5 pages, 8 figures | None |

In recent years, the development of machine learning and deep learning has greatly bolstered the power of computational pathology. However, there still remains the issue of data scarcity and data imbalance, which can have an adversarial effect on any computational method. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and effective data augmentation strategy to generate new pathology images from the existing pathology images and thus enrich datasets without additional data collection or annotation costs. To evaluate the proposed method, we employed two sets of colorectal cancer datasets and obtained improved classification results, suggesting that the proposed simple approach holds the potential for alleviating the data scarcity and imbalance in computational pathology.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neural Augmentation Based Panoramic High Dynamic Range Stitching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04679v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to saturated regions of inputting low dynamic range (LDR) images and large intensity changes among the LDR images caused by different exposures, it is challenging to produce an information enriched panoramic LDR image without visual artifacts for a high dynamic range (HDR) scene through stitching multiple geometrically synchronized LDR images with different exposures and pairwise overlapping fields of views (OFOVs). Fortunately, the stitching of such images is innately a perfect scenario for the fusion of a physics-driven approach and a data-driven approach due to their OFOVs. Based on this new insight, a novel neural augmentation based panoramic HDR stitching algorithm is proposed in this paper. The physics-driven approach is built up using the OFOVs. Different exposed images of each view are initially generated by using the physics-driven approach, are then refined by a data-driven approach, and are finally used to produce panoramic LDR images with different exposures. All the panoramic LDR images with different exposures are combined together via a multi-scale exposure fusion algorithm to produce the final panoramic LDR image. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms existing panoramic stitching algorithms.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |

Modern computational approaches now aim to emulate this fundamental creative process. Although recent diffusion models excel at text-guided compositional synthesis, text as a medium often lacks precise control over visual details. Image-based composition approaches can capture more nuanced features, but existing methods are typically limited in the range of concepts they can capture, and require expensive training procedures or specialized data. We present IP-Composer, a novel training-free approach for compositional image generation that leverages multiple image references simultaneously, while using natural language to describe the concept to be extracted from each image. Our method builds on IP-Adapter, which synthesizes novel images conditioned on an input image's CLIP embedding. We extend this approach to multiple visual inputs by crafting composite embeddings, stitched from the projections of multiple input images onto concept-specific CLIP-subspaces identified through text. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach enables more precise control over a larger range of visual concept compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ip-composer.github.io/IP-Composer/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ip-composer.github.io/IP-Composer) |

Inspired by the human creative process, we reformulate these tasks using a left-right stitching formulation to construct contextual input. Building upon this foundation, we propose AnyRefill, an extension of LeftRefill, that effectively adapts Text-to-Image (T2I) models to various vision tasks. AnyRefill leverages the inpainting priors of advanced T2I model based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, and incorporates flexible components to enhance its capabilities. By combining task-specific LoRAs with the stitching input, AnyRefill unlocks its potential across diverse tasks, including conditional generation, visual perception, and image editing, without requiring additional visual encoders. Meanwhile, AnyRefill exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring minimal task-specific fine-tuning while maintaining high generative performance. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that AnyRefill outperforms other image condition injection methods and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art open-source methods. Notably, AnyRefill delivers results comparable to advanced commercial tools, such as IC-Light and SeedEdit, even in challenging scenarios. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across versatile tasks validate the strong generation of the proposed simple yet effective LPG formulation, establishing AnyRefill as a unified, highly data-efficient solution for reference-based vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, submitted to TPAMI</p></details> | None |

Reviewing endoscopy videos often involves frequent adjustments and reorientations to piece together a complete view, which can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. Image stitching techniques address this issue by providing a continuous and complete visualization of the examined area. However, endoscopic images, particularly those of the esophagus, present unique challenges. The smooth surface, lack of distinct feature points, and non-horizontal orientation complicate the stitching process, rendering traditional feature-based methods often ineffective for these types of images. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing pipeline designed to enhance endoscopic image stitching through advanced computational techniques. Our approach converts endoscopic video data into continuous 2D images by following four key steps: (1) keyframe selection, (2) image rotation adjustment to correct distortions, (3) surface unwrapping using polar coordinate transformation to generate a flat image, and (4) feature point matching enhanced by Adaptive Histogram Equalization for improved feature detection. We evaluate stitching quality through the assessment of valid feature point match pairs. Experiments conducted on 20 pediatric endoscopy videos demonstrate that our method significantly improves image alignment and stitching quality compared to traditional techniques, laying a robust foundation for more effective panoramic image creation.</p></details> |  | None |

This study constructs a tailored multispectral remote sensing dataset and an end-to-end framework for weed detection to advance precision agriculture practices. Unmanned aerial vehicles were used to collect raw multispectral data from two experimental areas (E2 and E8) over four years, covering 0.6046 km^{2} and ground truth annotations were created with GPS-enabled vehicles to manually label weeds and crops. The dataset is specifically designed for agricultural applications in Western Australia. We propose an end-to-end framework for weed detection that includes extensive preprocessing steps, such as denoising, radiometric calibration, image alignment, orthorectification, and stitching. The proposed method combines vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, SAVI, MSAVI) with multispectral channels to form classification features, and employs several deep learning models to identify weeds based on the input features. Among these models, ResNet achieves the highest performance, with a weed detection accuracy of 0.9213, an F1-Score of 0.8735, an mIOU of 0.7888, and an mDC of 0.8865, validating the efficacy of the dataset and the proposed weed detection method.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, Accepted for oral presentation at IEEE 25th International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA 2024).

However, a comprehensive evaluation of their long-context capabilities remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce the MultiModal Needle-in-a-haystack (MMNeedle) benchmark, specifically designed to assess the long-context capabilities of MLLMs. Besides multi-image input, we employ image stitching to further increase the input context length, and develop a protocol to automatically generate labels for sub-image level retrieval. Essentially, MMNeedle evaluates MLLMs by stress-testing their capability to locate a target sub-image (needle) within a set of images (haystack) based on textual instructions and descriptions of image contents. This setup necessitates an advanced understanding of extensive visual contexts and effective information retrieval within long-context image inputs. With this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, encompassing both API-based and open-source models. The findings reveal that GPT-4o consistently surpasses other models in long-context scenarios, but suffers from hallucination problems in negative samples, i.e., when needles are not in the haystacks. Our comprehensive long-context evaluation of MLLMs also sheds lights on the considerable performance gap between API-based and open-source models.

However, personalized portrait generation remains challenging due to the diversity in user profiles, including variations in appearance and lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we propose IC-Portrait, a novel framework designed to accurately encode individual identities for personalized portrait generation. Our key insight is that pre-trained diffusion models are fast learners (e.g.,100 ~ 200 steps) for in-context dense correspondence matching, which motivates the two major designs of our IC-Portrait framework. Specifically, we reformulate portrait generation into two sub-tasks: 1) Lighting-Aware Stitching: we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 80%, yields a highly effective self-supervisory representation learning of reference image lighting. 2) View-Consistent Adaptation: we leverage a synthetic view-consistent profile dataset to learn the in-context correspondence. The reference profile can then be warped into arbitrary poses for strong spatial-aligned view conditioning. Coupling these two designs by simply concatenating latents to form ControlNet-like supervision and modeling, enables us to significantly enhance the identity preservation fidelity and stability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that IC-Portrait consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, with particularly notable improvements in visual qualities. Furthermore, IC-Portrait even demonstrates 3D-aware relighting capabilities.</p></details> | technical report | None |

To reduce the annotation cost and maintain satisfactory performance, in this work, we leverage the capabilities of SAM for establishing semi-supervised medical image segmentation models. Rethinking the requirements of effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility, we propose a three-stage framework, i.e., Stitching, Fine-tuning, and Re-training (SFR). The current fine-tuning approaches mostly involve 2D slice-wise fine-tuning that disregards the contextual information between adjacent slices. Our stitching strategy mitigates the mismatch between natural and 3D medical images. The stitched images are then used for fine-tuning SAM, providing robust initialization of pseudo-labels. Afterwards, we train a 3D semi-supervised segmentation model while maintaining the same parameter size as the conventional segmenter such as V-Net. Our SFR framework is plug-and-play, and easily compatible with various popular semi-supervised methods. We also develop an extended framework SFR$^+$ with selective fine-tuning and re-training through confidence estimation. Extensive experiments validate that our SFR and SFR$^+$ achieve significant improvements in both moderate annotation and scarce annotation across five datasets. In particular, SFR framework improves the Dice score of Mean Teacher from 29.68% to 74.40% with only one labeled data of LA dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Local Patch Alignment to Seam-cutting for Large Parallax Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18564v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seam cutting methods have been proven effective in the composition step of image stitching, especially for images with parallax. However, current seam cutting can be seen as the subsequent step after the image alignment is settled. Its effectiveness usually depends on the fact that images can be roughly aligned such that a local region exists where an unnoticeable seam can be found. Current alignment methods often fall short of expectations for images with large parallax, and most efforts are devoted to improving the alignment accuracy. In this paper, we argue that by adding a simple Local Patch Alignment Module (LPAM) into the seam cutting, the final result can be efficiently improved for large parallax image stitching. Concretely, we first evaluate the quality of pixels along the estimated seam of the seam cutting method. Then, for pixels with low qualities, we separate their enclosing patches in the aligned images and locally align them by constructing modified dense correspondences via SIFT flow. Finally, we composite the aligned patches via seam cutting and merge them into the original aligned result to generate the final mosaic. Experiments show that introducing LPAM can effectively and efficiently improve the stitching results.</p></details> | In peer review | None |

However, for self-driving applications, merely de-identifying faces and individuals might not provide sufficient privacy protection since street views like vehicles and buildings can still disclose locations, trajectories, and other sensitive information. Therefore, it remains crucial to extend anonymization techniques to street view images to fully preserve the privacy of users, pedestrians, and vehicles. In this paper, we propose a Street View Image Anonymization (SVIA) framework for self-driving applications. The SVIA framework consists of three integral components: a semantic segmenter to segment an input image into functional regions, an inpainter to generate alternatives to privacy-sensitive regions, and a harmonizer to seamlessly stitch modified regions to guarantee visual coherence. Compared to existing methods, SVIA achieves a much better trade-off between image generation quality and privacy protection, as evidenced by experimental results for five common metrics on two widely used public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables.

While existing target generation algorithms demonstrate remarkable performance in large-scale detection, their efficiency notably diminishes in few-seed scenarios. This decline is primarily attributed to the intricate configuration rules and sampling bias of seed addresses. Moreover, instances where BGP prefixes have few seed addresses are widespread, constituting 63.65% of occurrences. We introduce 6Vision as a solution to tackle this challenge by introducing a novel approach of encoding IPv6 addresses into images, facilitating comprehensive analysis of intricate configuration rules. Through a process of feature stitching, 6Vision not only improves the learnable features but also amalgamates addresses associated with configuration patterns for enhanced learning. Moreover, it integrates an environmental feedback mechanism to refine model parameters based on identified active addresses, thereby alleviating the sampling bias inherent in seed addresses. As a result, 6Vision achieves high-accuracy detection even in few-seed scenarios. The HitRate of 6Vision shows a significant improvement ranging from 181% to 2,490% compared to existing algorithms, while the CoverNum increases by a factor of 1.18 to 11.20 times. Additionally, 6Vision can function as a preliminary detection module for existing algorithms, yielding a conversion gain (CG) ranging from 242% to 2,081%. Ultimately, we achieve a conversion rate (CR) of 28.97% for few-seed scenarios. We develop the IPv6 hitlist Patch, which augments current target generation algorithms for large-scale address detection, thereby effectively supporting IPv6 network measurement and security analysis.</p></details> | ICNP 2024 Accepted | None |

The existing approaches exhibit the ability to align well, yet fall short in maintaining object structures. In this paper, we endeavour to safeguard the overall OBJect-level structures within images based on Global Similarity Prior (OBJ-GSP), on the basis of good alignment performance. Our approach leverages semantic segmentation models like the family of Segment Anything Model to extract the contours of any objects in a scene. Triangular meshes are employed in image transformation to protect the overall shapes of objects within images. The balance between alignment and distortion prevention is achieved by allowing the object meshes to strike a balance between similarity and projective transformation. We also demonstrate that object-level semantic information is necessary in low-altitude aerial image stitching. Additionally, we propose StitchBench, the largest image stitching benchmark with most diverse scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OBJ-GSP outperforms existing methods in both pixel alignment and shape preservation.

To reduce resource demands, various techniques, such as Neuron Pruning, are applied. Due to the complex structure of ANNs, interpreting the behavior of hidden layers and the features they recognize in the data is challenging. A lack of comprehensive understanding of which information is utilized during inference can lead to inefficient use of available data, thereby lowering the overall performance of the models. In this paper, we introduce a method for integrating Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the context of image recognition. This method significantly enhances the performance of neural networks by leveraging a broader range of information present in the data, enabling the model to make more informed and accurate predictions. Our approach, further referred to as Vector Stitching, involves combining raw image data with additional topological information derived through TDA methods. This approach enables the neural network to train on an enriched dataset, incorporating topological features that might otherwise remain unexploited or not captured by the network's inherent mechanisms. The results of our experiments highlight the potential of incorporating results of additional data analysis into the network's inference process, resulting in enhanced performance in pattern recognition tasks in digital images, particularly when using limited datasets. This work contributes to the development of methods for integrating TDA with deep learning and explores how concepts from Information Theory can explain the performance of such hybrid methods in practical implementation environments.</p></details> |  | None |

We present DepthCrafter, an innovative method for generating temporally consistent long depth sequences with intricate details for open-world videos, without requiring any supplementary information such as camera poses or optical flow. The generalization ability to open-world videos is achieved by training the video-to-depth model from a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model, through our meticulously designed three-stage training strategy. Our training approach enables the model to generate depth sequences with variable lengths at one time, up to 110 frames, and harvest both precise depth details and rich content diversity from realistic and synthetic datasets. We also propose an inference strategy that can process extremely long videos through segment-wise estimation and seamless stitching. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets reveal that DepthCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-world video depth estimation under zero-shot settings. Furthermore, DepthCrafter facilitates various downstream applications, including depth-based visual effects and conditional video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://depthcrafter.github.io</p></details> | None |

Previous approaches often rely on separate modules that analyze diagram elements individually, neglecting the diagram's overall structure. We address this limitation by proposing a novel approach that utilizes the Relationformer, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, to extract graphs from P&IDs. Our method leverages the ability of the Relationformer to simultaneously detect objects and their relationships in images, making it suitable for the task of graph extraction from engineering diagrams. We apply our proposed approach to both real-world and synthetically created P&ID datasets, and evaluate its effectiveness by comparing it with a modular digitization approach based on recent literature. We present PID2Graph, the first publicly accessible P&ID dataset featuring comprehensive labels for the graph structure, including symbols, nodes and their connections that is used for evaluation. To understand the effect of patching and stitching of both of the approaches, we compare values before and after merging the patches. For the real-world data, the Relationformer achieves convincing results, outperforming the modular digitization approach for edge detection by more than 25%. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the performance of P&ID digitization methods and opens up new avenues for research in this area using transformer architectures. The P&ID dataset used for evaluation will be published and publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  | None |

However, using supervised learning methods is often challenging or costly due to the difficulty of collecting ground-truth data. In response, unsupervised learning approaches have emerged. Most early methods, though, assume that the given image pairs are from the same camera or have minor lighting differences. Consequently, while these methods perform effectively under such conditions, they generally fail when input image pairs come from different domains, referred to as multimodal image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose AltO, an unsupervised learning framework for estimating homography in multimodal image pairs. Our method employs a two-phase alternating optimization framework, similar to Expectation-Maximization (EM), where one phase reduces the geometry gap and the other addresses the modality gap. To handle these gaps, we use Barlow Twins loss for the modality gap and propose an extended version, Geometry Barlow Twins, for the geometry gap. As a result, we demonstrate that our method, AltO, can be trained on multimodal datasets without any ground-truth data. It not only outperforms other unsupervised methods but is also compatible with various architectures of homography estimators.

The traditional method excels in creating artistic abstractions but can struggle with seamlessness, whereas the machine learning method preserves the integrity of foreground elements while enhancing the background, offering improved aesthetic quality and computational efficiency.

We propose a NeRF-based method of color consistency correction for multi-view images, which weaves image features together using implicit expressions, and then re-illuminates feature space to generate a fusion image with a new perspective. We chose Superview-1 satellite images and UAV images with large range and time difference for the experiment.

However, registering US images with only partially overlapping anatomical contents is a challenging task. In this work, we introduce SynStitch, a self-supervised framework designed for 2DUS stitching. SynStitch consists of a synthetic stitching pair generation module (SSPGM) and an image stitching module (ISM). SSPGM utilizes a patch-conditioned ControlNet to generate realistic 2DUS stitching pairs with known affine matrix from a single input image. ISM then utilizes this synthetic paired data to learn 2DUS stitching in a supervised manner. Our framework was evaluated against multiple leading methods on a kidney ultrasound dataset, demonstrating superior 2DUS stitching performance through both qualitative and quantitative analyses.

| **[Stitching Dynamic Movement Primitives and Image-based Visual Servo Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00088v6)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing perception for feedback control in combination with Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP)-based motion generation for a robot's end-effector control is a useful solution for many robotic manufacturing tasks. For instance, while performing an insertion task when the hole or the recipient part is not visible in the eye-in-hand camera, a learning-based movement primitive method can be used to generate the end-effector path. Once the recipient part is in the field of view (FOV), Image-based Visual Servo (IBVS) can be used to control the motion of the robot. Inspired by such applications, this paper presents a generalized control scheme that switches between motion generation using DMPs and IBVS control. To facilitate the design, a common state space representation for the DMP and the IBVS systems is first established. Stability analysis of the switched system using multiple Lyapunov functions shows that the state trajectories converge to a bound asymptotically. The developed method is validated by two real world experiments using the eye-in-hand configuration on a Baxter research robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Stitching frames of a panning video into a panoramic photograph is a well-understood problem for stationary scenes, but when objects are moving, a still panorama cannot capture the scene. We present a method for synthesizing a panoramic video from a casually-captured panning video, as if the original video were captured with a wide-angle camera. We pose panorama synthesis as a space-time outpainting problem, where we aim to create a full panoramic video of the same length as the input video. Consistent completion of the space-time volume requires a powerful, realistic prior over video content and motion, for which we adapt generative video models. Existing generative models do not, however, immediately extend to panorama completion, as we show. We instead apply video generation as a component of our panorama synthesis system, and demonstrate how to exploit the strengths of the models while minimizing their limitations. Our system can create video panoramas for a range of in-the-wild scenes including people, vehicles, and flowing water, as well as stationary background features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://vidpanos.github.io/.

This study introduces PixLore, a novel method that leverages Querying Transformers through the fine-tuning of the BLIP-2 model using the LoRa method on a standard commercial GPU. The followed approach, which involves training on a carefully assembled dataset from state-of-the-art Computer Vision models combined and augmented by ChatGPT, addresses the question of whether intricate image understanding can be achieved with an ensemble of smaller-scale models, referred to as Knowledge Stitching. Comparative evaluations against major models such as GPT-4 and Google Bard demonstrate that PixLore-2.7B, despite having considerably fewer parameters, is rated higher than the existing State-of-the-Art models in over half of the assessments. Precisely, PixLore outperform Bard and BLIP-2, which score approximately 35.18% and 27.98% lower than PixLore in the task of image captioning.

While conventional phase retrieval algorithms can iteratively recover the images, they require oversampled diffraction patterns, incur significant computational costs, and struggle to recover the absolute phase of the sample's transmission function. Deep learning algorithms for ptychography are a promising approach to resolving the limitations of iterative algorithms. We present PtychoFormer, a hierarchical transformer-based model for data-driven single-shot ptychographic phase retrieval. PtychoFormer processes subsets of diffraction patterns, generating local inferences that are seamlessly stitched together to produce a high-quality reconstruction. Our model exhibits tolerance to sparsely scanned diffraction patterns and achieves up to 3600 times faster imaging speed than the extended ptychographic iterative engine (ePIE). We also propose the extended-PtychoFormer (ePF), a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of PtychoFormer with the ePIE. ePF minimizes global phase shifts and significantly enhances reconstruction quality, achieving state-of-the-art phase retrieval in ptychography.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures | None |

Traditional methods depending on supervised learning with 3D point clouds are limited by scarce datasets. Recently zero-shot methods leveraging LLMs have been proposed to address the data issue.

However, most existing methods generate single-view images using generative models and then stitch them together in 3D space. This independent generation for each view often results in spatial inconsistency and implausibility in the 3D scenes. To address this challenge, we proposed a novel text-driven 3D-consistent scene generation model: SceneDreamer360. Our proposed method leverages a text-driven panoramic image generation model as a prior for 3D scene generation and employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to ensure consistency across multi-view panoramic images. Specifically, SceneDreamer360 enhances the fine-tuned Panfusion generator with a three-stage panoramic enhancement, enabling the generation of high-resolution, detail-rich panoramic images. During the 3D scene construction, a novel point cloud fusion initialization method is used, producing higher quality and spatially consistent point clouds. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to other methods, SceneDreamer360 with its panoramic image generation and 3DGS can produce higher quality, spatially consistent, and visually appealing 3D scenes from any text prompt.

Existing approaches typically synthesize textures on the garment surface through 2D-to-3D texture mapping or depth-aware inpainting via generative models. Unfortunately, these methods often struggle to capture and preserve texture details, particularly due to challenging occlusions, distortions, or poses in the input image. Inspired by the observation that in the fashion industry, most garments are constructed by stitching sewing patterns with flat, repeatable textures, we cast the task of clothing texture transfer as extracting distortion-free, tileable texture materials that are subsequently mapped onto the UV space of the garment. Building upon this insight, we train a denoising diffusion model with a large-scale synthetic dataset to rectify distortions in the input texture image. This process yields a flat texture map that enables a tight coupling with existing Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) material generation pipelines, allowing for realistic relighting of the garment under various lighting conditions. We show that FabricDiffusion can transfer various features from a single clothing image including texture patterns, material properties, and detailed prints and logos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-to-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real-world, in-the-wild clothing images while generalizing to unseen textures and garment shapes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

While there exist encoders that achieve good results in 3D GAN inversion, they are predominantly built on EG3D, which specializes in synthesizing near-frontal views and is limiting in synthesizing comprehensive 3D scenes from diverse viewpoints. In contrast to existing approaches, we propose a novel framework built on PanoHead, which excels in synthesizing images from a 360-degree perspective. To achieve realistic 3D modeling of the input image, we introduce a dual encoder system tailored for high-fidelity reconstruction and realistic generation from different viewpoints. Accompanying this, we propose a stitching framework on the triplane domain to get the best predictions from both. To achieve seamless stitching, both encoders must output consistent results despite being specialized for different tasks. For this reason, we carefully train these encoders using specialized losses, including an adversarial loss based on our novel occlusion-aware triplane discriminator.

Tool-augmented LLMs hold tremendous promise for automating the generation of such computational plans. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as planners for multi-step multi-modal tasks has prevented a systematic study of planner design decisions. Should LLMs generate a full plan in a single shot or step-by-step? Should they invoke tools directly with Python code or through structured data formats like JSON? Does feedback improve planning? To answer these questions and more, we introduce m&m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks involving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and image processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provide automatically generated plans using this realistic toolset. We further provide a high-quality subset of 1,565 task plans that are human-verified and correctly executable. With m&m's, we evaluate 10 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies (multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3 types of feedback (parsing/verification/execution). Finally, we summarize takeaways from our extensive experiments.

Even with image streams from cameras directly attached to an HMD, stitching together a convincing image of an entire face remains a challenging task because of extreme capture angles and strong lens distortions due to a wide field of view. Compared to the long line of research in VR, reconstruction of faces hidden beneath an HMD is a very recent topic of research. While the current state-of-the-art solutions demonstrate photo-realistic 3D reconstruction results, they require high-cost laboratory equipment and large computational costs. We present an approach that focuses on low-cost hardware and can be used on a commodity gaming computer with a single GPU. We leverage the benefits of an end-to-end pipeline by means of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our GAN produces a frontal-facing 2.5D point cloud based on a training dataset captured with an RGBD camera. In our approach, the training process is offline, while the reconstruction runs in real-time. Our results show adequate reconstruction quality within the 'learned' expressions. Expressions not learned by the network produce artifacts and can trigger the Uncanny Valley effect.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a diffusion model-based pipeline that formulates the cloth state estimation as an image generation problem by representing the cloth state as an RGB image that describes the point-wise translation (translation map) between a pre-defined flattened mesh and the deformed mesh in a canonical space. Then we train a conditional diffusion-based image generation model to predict the translation map based on an observation. Experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate the performance of our method.

The total energy function is then optimized to order unordered images, and a hybrid energy function is introduced to optimize the best seam, effectively eliminating parallax artifacts.

| **[A Low-Computational Video Synopsis Framework with a Standard Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05230v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video synopsis is an efficient method for condensing surveillance videos. This technique begins with the detection and tracking of objects, followed by the creation of object tubes. These tubes consist of sequences, each containing chronologically ordered bounding boxes of a unique object. To generate a condensed video, the first step involves rearranging the object tubes to maximize the number of non-overlapping objects in each frame. Then, these tubes are stitched to a background image extracted from the source video. The lack of a standard dataset for the video synopsis task hinders the comparison of different video synopsis models. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a standard dataset, called SynoClip, designed specifically for the video synopsis task. SynoClip includes all the necessary features needed to evaluate various models directly and effectively. Additionally, this work introduces a video synopsis model, called FGS, with low computational cost. The model includes an empty-frame object detector to identify frames empty of any objects, facilitating efficient utilization of the deep object detector. Moreover, a tube grouping algorithm is proposed to maintain relationships among tubes in the synthesized video. This is followed by a greedy tube rearrangement algorithm, which efficiently determines the start time of each tube. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated using the proposed dataset.

Multiple synthetic outputs must be stitched together to create paragraphs or whole pages, whereby consistency and layout information are lost. To close this gap, we propose a method for imitating handwriting at the paragraph level that also works for unseen writing styles. Therefore, we introduce a modified latent diffusion model that enriches the encoder-decoder mechanism with specialized loss functions that explicitly preserve the style and content. We enhance the attention mechanism of the diffusion model with adaptive 2D positional encoding and the conditioning mechanism to work with two modalities simultaneously: a style image and the target text. This significantly improves the realism of the generated handwriting. Our approach sets a new benchmark in our comprehensive evaluation. It outperforms all existing imitation methods at both line and paragraph levels, considering combined style and content preservation.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Segment Using Just One Example](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07393v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is an important topic in computer vision with many relevant application in Earth observation. While supervised methods exist, the constraints of limited annotated data has encouraged development of unsupervised approaches. However, existing unsupervised methods resemble clustering and cannot be directly mapped to explicit target classes. In this paper, we deal with single shot semantic segmentation, where one example for the target class is provided, which is used to segment the target class from query/test images. Our approach exploits recently popular Segment Anything (SAM), a promptable foundation model. We specifically design several techniques to automatically generate prompts from the only example/key image in such a way that the segmentation is successfully achieved on a stitch or concatenation of the example/key and query/test images. Proposed technique does not involve any training phase and just requires one example image to grasp the concept. Furthermore, no text-based prompt is required for the proposed method. We evaluated the proposed techniques on building and car classes.</p></details> |  | None |

Typically, conventional image stitching techniques, other than deep learning, require complex computation and thus computational pricy, especially for stitching large raw images. In this study, inspired by the multiscale feature of fluid turbulence, we developed a fast feature point detection algorithm named local-peak scale-invariant feature transform (LP-SIFT), based on the multiscale local peaks and scale-invariant feature transform method. By combining LP-SIFT and RANSAC in image stitching, the stitching speed can be improved by orders, compared with the original SIFT method. Nine large images (over 2600*1600 pixels), arranged randomly without prior knowledge, can be stitched within 158.94 s. The algorithm is highly practical for applications requiring a wide field of view in diverse application scenes, e.g., terrain mapping, biological analysis, and even criminal investigation.</p></details> |  | None |

Image mosaicking is a technique for aligning multiple overlapping images to obtain a larger FoV. Current mosaicking pipelines often struggle with substantial noise and considerable displacement between the input sub-fields. In this paper, we propose a versatile pipeline for stitching multi-view OCT/OCTA \textit{en face} projection images. Our method combines the strengths of learning-based feature matching and robust pixel-based registration to align multiple images effectively. Furthermore, we advance the application of a trained foundational model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to validate mosaicking results in an unsupervised manner. The efficacy of our pipeline is validated using an in-house dataset and a large public dataset, where our method shows superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. We also made our evaluation tool for image mosaicking and the corresponding pipeline publicly available at \url{https://github.com/MedICL-VU/OCT-mosaicking}.</p></details> | ISBI 2024 Oral | [Code Link](https://github.com/MedICL-VU/OCT-mosaicking) |

We investigate this by measuring the latent space similarity of four different models: VAEs, GANs, Normalizing Flows (NFs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Our methodology involves training linear maps between frozen latent spaces to "stitch" arbitrary pairs of encoders and decoders and measuring output-based and probe-based metrics on the resulting "stitched'' models. Our main findings are that linear maps between latent spaces of performant models preserve most visual information even when latent sizes differ; for CelebA models, gender is the most similarly represented probe-able attribute. Finally we show on an NF that latent space representations converge early in training.</p></details> |  | None |

For training, we present an action dictionary-guided design, which consistently yields the most favorable results across our experiments. In the realm of VQA, we leverage object-level features and deploy co-attention networks to train both object and question features. Notably, we introduce a novel frame-question cross-attention mechanism at the network's core for enhanced performance.

It unveils the temporal instability of warped content in non-overlapping regions, despite image stitching having endeavored to preserve the natural structures. Therefore, in most cases, even if the input videos to be stitched are stable, the stitched video will inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and affect the visual experience. To eliminate the shakes, we propose StabStitch to simultaneously realize video stitching and video stabilization in a unified unsupervised learning framework. Starting from the camera paths in video stabilization, we first derive the expression of stitching trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal warps. Then a warp smoothing model is presented to optimize them with a comprehensive consideration regarding content alignment, trajectory smoothness, spatial consistency, and online collaboration. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes. Compared with existing stitching solutions, StabStitch exhibits significant superiority in scene robustness and inference speed in addition to stitching and stabilization performance, contributing to a robust and real-time online video stitching system.

However, detailed edit and customization of 3D assets remains a long-standing challenge. Specifically, 3D Generation methods lack the ability to follow finely detailed instructions as precisely as their 2D image creation counterparts. Imagine you can get a toy through 3D AIGC but with undesired accessories and dressing. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel pipeline called Tailor3D, which swiftly creates customized 3D assets from editable dual-side images. We aim to emulate a tailor's ability to locally change objects or perform overall style transfer. Unlike creating 3D assets from multiple views, using dual-side images eliminates conflicts on overlapping areas that occur when editing individual views. Specifically, it begins by editing the front view, then generates the back view of the object through multi-view diffusion. Afterward, it proceeds to edit the back views. Finally, a Dual-sided LRM is proposed to seamlessly stitch together the front and back 3D features, akin to a tailor sewing together the front and back of a garment. The Dual-sided LRM rectifies imperfect consistencies between the front and back views, enhancing editing capabilities and reducing memory burdens while seamlessly integrating them into a unified 3D representation with the LoRA Triplane Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate Tailor3D's effectiveness across various 3D generation and editing tasks, including 3D generative fill and style transfer. It provides a user-friendly, efficient solution for editing 3D assets, with each editing step taking only seconds to complete.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tailor3d-2024.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Various warping-based methods are proposed to address it, yet the results are unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel image stitching method using multi-homography warping guided by image segmentation. Specifically, we leverage the Segment Anything Model to segment the target image into numerous contents and partition the feature points into multiple subsets via the energy-based multi-homography fitting algorithm. The multiple subsets of feature points are used to calculate the corresponding multiple homographies. For each segmented content in the overlapping region, we select its best-fitting homography with the lowest photometric error. For each segmented content in the non-overlapping region, we calculate a weighted combination of the linearized homographies. Finally, the target image is warped via the best-fitting homographies to align with the reference image, and the final panorama is generated via linear blending. Comprehensive experimental results on the public datasets demonstrate that our method provides the best alignment accuracy by a large margin, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Single-image camera calibration with model-free distortion correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01263v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera calibration is a process of paramount importance in computer vision applications that require accurate quantitative measurements. The popular method developed by Zhang relies on the use of a large number of images of a planar grid of fiducial points captured in multiple poses. Although flexible and easy to implement, Zhang's method has some limitations. The simultaneous optimization of the entire parameter set, including the coefficients of a predefined distortion model, may result in poor distortion correction at the image boundaries or in miscalculation of the intrinsic parameters, even with a reasonably small reprojection error. Indeed, applications involving image stitching (e.g. multi-camera systems) require accurate mapping of distortion up to the outermost regions of the image. Moreover, intrinsic parameters affect the accuracy of camera pose estimation, which is fundamental for applications such as vision servoing in robot navigation and automated assembly. This paper proposes a method for estimating the complete set of calibration parameters from a single image of a planar speckle pattern covering the entire sensor. The correspondence between image points and physical points on the calibration target is obtained using Digital Image Correlation. The effective focal length and the extrinsic parameters are calculated separately after a prior evaluation of the principal point. At the end of the procedure, a dense and uniform model-free distortion map is obtained over the entire image. Synthetic data with different noise levels were used to test the feasibility of the proposed method and to compare its metrological performance with Zhang's method. Real-world tests demonstrate the potential of the developed method to reveal aspects of the image formation that are hidden by averaging over multiple images.</p></details> | Accepted manuscript | None |
| **[Latent Space Translation via Inverse Relative Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15057v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of similar representations between independently trained neural models has sparked significant interest in the representation learning community, leading to the development of various methods to obtain communication between latent spaces. "Latent space communication" can be achieved in two ways: i) by independently mapping the original spaces to a shared or relative one; ii) by directly estimating a transformation from a source latent space to a target one. In this work, we combine the two into a novel method to obtain latent space translation through the relative space. By formalizing the invertibility of angle-preserving relative representations and assuming the scale invariance of decoder modules in neural models, we can effectively use the relative space as an intermediary, independently projecting onto and from other semantically similar spaces. Extensive experiments over various architectures and datasets validate our scale invariance assumption and demonstrate the high accuracy of our method in latent space translation. We also apply our method to zero-shot stitching between arbitrary pre-trained text and image encoders and their classifiers, even across modalities. Our method has significant potential for facilitating the reuse of models in a practical manner via compositionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.00664, arXiv:2406.11014</p></details> | None |

The color and brightness along stitched seam location may look discontinuous among multiple cameras which impacts overall stitched image visual quality. To improve the color transition between adjacent cameras in stitching algorithm, we propose harmonization algorithm which applies before stitching to adjust multiple cameras' color and tone so that stitched image has smoother color and tone transition between adjacent cameras. Our proposed harmonization algorithm consists of AWB harmonization and GTM harmonization leveraging Image Signal Processor (ISP)'s AWB and GTM metadata statistics. Experiment result shows that our proposed algorithm outperforms global color transfer method in both visual quality and computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |

As a common data augmentation method, Mosaic data augmentation technique stitches multiple images together to increase the diversity and complexity of training data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Although Mosaic data augmentation achieves excellent results in general detection tasks by stitching images together, it still has certain limitations for specific detection tasks. This paper addresses the challenge of detecting a large number of densely distributed small objects in aerial images by proposing the Select-Mosaic data augmentation method, which is improved with a fine-grained region selection strategy. The improved Select-Mosaic method demonstrates superior performance in handling dense small object detection tasks, significantly enhancing the accuracy and stability of detection models.

Each stage requires its own network training and is tightly coupled to the others, leading to error propagation and posing significant challenges to parameter tuning and system stability. This paper proposes the Simple and Robust Stitcher (SRStitcher), which revolutionizes the image stitching pipeline by simplifying the fusion and rectangling stages into a unified inpainting model, requiring no model training or fine-tuning. We reformulate the problem definitions of the fusion and rectangling stages and demonstrate that they can be effectively integrated into an inpainting task. Furthermore, we design the weighted masks to guide the reverse process in a pre-trained largescale diffusion model, implementing this integrated inpainting task in a single inference. Through extensive experimentation, we verify the interpretability and generalization capabilities of this unified model, demonstrating that SRStitcher outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and stability.

However, the cumulative costs of digital multi-slide high-speed brightfield scanners, cloud/on-premises storage, and personnel (IT and technicians) make the current slide digitization workflows out-of-reach for limited-resource settings, further widening the health equity gap; even single-slide manual scanning commercial solutions are costly due to hardware requirements (high-resolution cameras, high-spec PC/workstation, and support for only high-end microscopes). In this work, we present a new cloud slide digitization workflow for creating scanner-quality whole-slide images (WSIs) from uploaded low-quality videos, acquired from cheap and inexpensive microscopes with built-in cameras. Specifically, we present a pipeline to create stitched WSIs while automatically deblurring out-of-focus regions, upsampling input 10X images to 40X resolution, and reducing brightness/contrast and light-source illumination variations. We demonstrate the WSI creation efficacy from our workflow on World Health Organization-declared neglected tropical disease, Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (prevalent only in the poorest regions of the world and only diagnosed by sub-specialist dermatopathologists, rare in poor countries), as well as other common pathologies on core biopsies of breast, liver, duodenum, stomach and lymph node.

Existing methods often struggle to maintain both the local and global structures of the image while reducing alignment artifacts and warping distortions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes epipolar geometry to establish a warping technique based on the epipolar displacement field. Initially, the warping rule for pixels in the epipolar geometry is established through the infinite homography. Subsequently, the epipolar displacement field, which represents the sliding distance of the warped pixel along the epipolar line, is formulated by thin-plate splines based on the principle of local elastic deformation. The stitching result can be generated by inversely warping the pixels according to the epipolar displacement field. This method incorporates the epipolar constraints in the warping rule, which ensures high-quality alignment and maintains the projectivity of the panorama. Qualitative and quantitative comparative experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method for stitching images with large parallax.</p></details> |  | None |

To alleviate the modality gap, recent methods generate intermediate images by GANs, grayscaling, or mixup strategies. However, these methods could introduce extra data distribution, and the semantic correspondence between the two modalities is not well learned. In this paper, we propose a Patch-Mixed Cross-Modality framework (PMCM), where two images of the same person from two modalities are split into patches and stitched into a new one for model learning. A part-alignment loss is introduced to regularize representation learning, and a patch-mixed modality learning loss is proposed to align between the modalities. In this way, the model learns to recognize a person through patches of different styles, thereby the modality semantic correspondence can be inferred. In addition, with the flexible image generation strategy, the patch-mixed images freely adjust the ratio of different modality patches, which could further alleviate the modality imbalance problem. On two VI-ReID datasets, we report new state-of-the-art performance with the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

Most prior work in this area generates scenes by iteratively stitching newly generated frames with existing geometry. These works often depend on pre-trained monocular depth estimators to lift the generated images into 3D, fusing them with the existing scene representation. These approaches are then often evaluated via a text metric, measuring the similarity between the generated images and a given text prompt. In this work, we make two fundamental contributions to the field of 3D scene generation. First, we note that lifting images to 3D with a monocular depth estimation model is suboptimal as it ignores the geometry of the existing scene. We thus introduce a novel depth completion model, trained via teacher distillation and self-training to learn the 3D fusion process, resulting in improved geometric coherence of the scene. Second, we introduce a new benchmarking scheme for scene generation methods that is based on ground truth geometry, and thus measures the quality of the structure of the scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.paulengstler.com/invisible-stitch/</p></details> | None |

It consists of image segmentation followed by evolutionary optimization of a novel loss function, providing a unified and accurate multi-camera calibration solution with high visual fidelity. The outcome allows the creation of virtual stitched views from multiple video sources, being as important for practical applications as numerical accuracy.

In the generalized setting, the task extends to segment both the base and the novel classes. The main challenge is how to train the model such that the addition of novel classes does not hurt the base classes performance, also known as catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we use SegGPT as our base model and train it on the base classes. Then, we use separate learnable prompts to handle predictions for each novel class. To handle various object sizes which typically present in remote sensing domain, we perform patch-based prediction. To address the discontinuities along patch boundaries, we propose a patch-and-stitch technique by re-framing the problem as an image inpainting task. During inference, we also utilize image similarity search over image embeddings for prompt selection and novel class filtering to reduce false positive predictions. Based on our experiments, our proposed method boosts the weighted mIoU of a simple fine-tuned SegGPT from 15.96 to 35.08 on the validation set of few-shot OpenEarthMap dataset given in the challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPRW 2024</p></details> | None |

However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) image-based object detection methods often struggle due to the complex geometric structures of branches, leaves and fruits, leading to incorrect determination of lychee picking points. In this study, we propose a Fcaf3d-lychee network model specifically designed for the accurate localisation of lychee picking points. Point cloud data of lychee picking points in natural environments are acquired using Microsoft's Azure Kinect DK time-of-flight (TOF) camera through multi-view stitching. We augment the Fully Convolutional Anchor-Free 3D Object Detection (Fcaf3d) model with a squeeze-and-excitation(SE) module, which exploits human visual attention mechanisms for improved feature extraction of lychee picking points. The trained network model is evaluated on a test set of lychee-picking locations and achieves an impressive F1 score of 88.57%, significantly outperforming existing models. Subsequent three-dimensional (3D) position detection of picking points in real lychee orchard environments yields high accuracy, even under varying degrees of occlusion. Localisation errors of lychee picking points are within 1.5 cm in all directions, demonstrating the robustness and generality of the model.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods rely on a large amount of light-stage captured data to learn facial reflectance models. However, the lack of subject diversity poses challenges in achieving good generalization and widespread applicability. In this paper, we learn the reflectance prior in image space rather than UV space and present a framework named ID2Reflectance. Our framework can directly estimate the reflectance maps of a single image while using limited reflectance data for training. Our key insight is that reflectance data shares facial structures with RGB faces, which enables obtaining expressive facial prior from inexpensive RGB data thus reducing the dependency on reflectance data. We first learn a high-quality prior for facial reflectance. Specifically, we pretrain multi-domain facial feature codebooks and design a codebook fusion method to align the reflectance and RGB domains. Then, we propose an identity-conditioned swapping module that injects facial identity from the target image into the pre-trained autoencoder to modify the identity of the source reflectance image. Finally, we stitch multi-view swapped reflectance images to obtain renderable assets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits excellent generalization capability and achieves state-of-the-art facial reflectance reconstruction results for in-the-wild faces.

To solve non-rectangular boundaries, current solutions involve cropping, which discards image content, inpainting, which can introduce unrelated content, or warping, which can distort non-linear features and introduce artifacts. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel diffusion-based learning framework, \textbf{RecDiffusion}, for image stitching rectangling. This framework combines Motion Diffusion Models (MDM) to generate motion fields, effectively transitioning from the stitched image's irregular borders to a geometrically corrected intermediary. Followed by Content Diffusion Models (CDM) for image detail refinement. Notably, our sampling process utilizes a weighted map to identify regions needing correction during each iteration of CDM. Our RecDiffusion ensures geometric accuracy and overall visual appeal, surpassing all previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative measures when evaluated on public benchmarks.

| **[LeftRefill: Filling Right Canvas based on Left Reference through Generalized Text-to-Image Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11577v3)** | 2024-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces LeftRefill, an innovative approach to efficiently harness large Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models for reference-guided image synthesis. As the name implies, LeftRefill horizontally stitches reference and target views together as a whole input. The reference image occupies the left side, while the target canvas is positioned on the right. Then, LeftRefill paints the right-side target canvas based on the left-side reference and specific task instructions. Such a task formulation shares some similarities with contextual inpainting, akin to the actions of a human painter. This novel formulation efficiently learns both structural and textured correspondence between reference and target without other image encoders or adapters. We inject task and view information through cross-attention modules in T2I models, and further exhibit multi-view reference ability via the re-arranged self-attention modules. These enable LeftRefill to perform consistent generation as a generalized model without requiring test-time fine-tuning or model modifications. Thus, LeftRefill can be seen as a simple yet unified framework to address reference-guided synthesis. As an exemplar, we leverage LeftRefill to address two different challenges: reference-guided inpainting and novel view synthesis, based on the pre-trained StableDiffusion.

| **[Stitching Gaps: Fusing Situated Perceptual Knowledge with Vision Transformers for High-Level Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19339v1)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for automatic high-level image understanding, particularly in detecting abstract concepts (AC) within images, underscores the necessity for innovative and more interpretable approaches. These approaches need to harmonize traditional deep vision methods with the nuanced, context-dependent knowledge humans employ to interpret images at intricate semantic levels. In this work, we leverage situated perceptual knowledge of cultural images to enhance performance and interpretability in AC image classification. We automatically extract perceptual semantic units from images, which we then model and integrate into the ARTstract Knowledge Graph (AKG). This resource captures situated perceptual semantics gleaned from over 14,000 cultural images labeled with ACs. Additionally, we enhance the AKG with high-level linguistic frames. We compute KG embeddings and experiment with relative representations and hybrid approaches that fuse these embeddings with visual transformer embeddings. Finally, for interpretability, we conduct posthoc qualitative analyses by examining model similarities with training instances. Our results show that our hybrid KGE-ViT methods outperform existing techniques in AC image classification. The posthoc interpretability analyses reveal the visual transformer's proficiency in capturing pixel-level visual attributes, contrasting with our method's efficacy in representing more abstract and semantic scene elements. We demonstrate the synergy and complementarity between KGE embeddings' situated perceptual knowledge and deep visual model's sensory-perceptual understanding for AC image classification. This work suggests a strong potential of neuro-symbolic methods for knowledge integration and robust image representation for use in downstream intricate visual comprehension tasks. All the materials and code are available online.</p></details> | Preprint | None |
| **[Towards Robust Image Stitching: An Adaptive Resistance Learning against Compatible Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15959v1)** | 2024-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching seamlessly integrates images captured from varying perspectives into a single wide field-of-view image. Such integration not only broadens the captured scene but also augments holistic perception in computer vision applications. Given a pair of captured images, subtle perturbations and distortions which go unnoticed by the human visual system tend to attack the correspondence matching, impairing the performance of image stitching algorithms. In light of this challenge, this paper presents the first attempt to improve the robustness of image stitching against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce a stitching-oriented attack~(SoA), tailored to amplify the alignment loss within overlapping regions, thereby targeting the feature matching procedure. To establish an attack resistant model, we delve into the robustness of stitching architecture and develop an adaptive adversarial training~(AAT) to balance attack resistance with stitching precision. In this way, we relieve the gap between the routine adversarial training and benign models, ensuring resilience without quality compromise. Comprehensive evaluation across real-world and synthetic datasets validate the deterioration of SoA on stitching performance. Furthermore, AAT emerges as a more robust solution against adversarial perturbations, delivering superior stitching results.

| **[T-Stitch: Accelerating Sampling in Pre-Trained Diffusion Models with Trajectory Stitching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14167v1)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) is often expensive for high-quality image generation and typically requires many steps with a large model. In this paper, we introduce sampling Trajectory Stitching T-Stitch, a simple yet efficient technique to improve the sampling efficiency with little or no generation degradation. Instead of solely using a large DPM for the entire sampling trajectory, T-Stitch first leverages a smaller DPM in the initial steps as a cheap drop-in replacement of the larger DPM and switches to the larger DPM at a later stage. Our key insight is that different diffusion models learn similar encodings under the same training data distribution and smaller models are capable of generating good global structures in the early steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that T-Stitch is training-free, generally applicable for different architectures, and complements most existing fast sampling techniques with flexible speed and quality trade-offs. On DiT-XL, for example, 40% of the early timesteps can be safely replaced with a 10x faster DiT-S without performance drop on class-conditional ImageNet generation. We further show that our method can also be used as a drop-in technique to not only accelerate the popular pretrained stable diffusion (SD) models but also improve the prompt alignment of stylized SD models from the public model zoo.

Dental CBCT alone may not be able to delineate precise details of the tooth surface due to limited image resolution and various CBCT artifacts, including metal-induced artifacts. IOS is very accurate for the scanning of narrow areas, but it produces cumulative stitching errors during full-arch scanning. The proposed method is intended not only to compensate the low-quality of CBCT-derived tooth surfaces with IOS, but also to correct the cumulative stitching errors of IOS across the entire dental arch. Moreover, the integration provide both gingival structure of IOS and tooth roots of CBCT in one image. The proposed fully automated method consists of four parts; (i) individual tooth segmentation and identification module for IOS data (TSIM-IOS); (ii) individual tooth segmentation and identification module for CBCT data (TSIM-CBCT); (iii) global-to-local tooth registration between IOS and CBCT; and (iv) stitching error correction of full-arch IOS. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved landmark and surface distance errors of 112.4 $μ$m and 301.7 $μ$m, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Analysis of microscopy images that reveal defects typically requires image analysis tasks such as segmentation and object detection. With the permanently increasing amount of data that is produced by experiments, handling these tasks manually becomes more and more impossible. In this work, we combine various image analysis and data mining techniques for creating a robust and accurate, automated image analysis pipeline. This allows for extracting the type and position of all defects in a microscopy image of a KOH-etched 4H-SiC wafer that was stitched together from approximately 40,000 individual images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stitching the Spectrum: Semantic Spectrum Segmentation with Wideband Signal Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03465v2)** | 2024-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectrum has become an extremely scarce and congested resource. As a consequence, spectrum sensing enables the coexistence of different wireless technologies in shared spectrum bands. Most existing work requires spectrograms to classify signals. Ultimately, this implies that images need to be continuously created from I/Q samples, thus creating unacceptable latency for real-time operations. In addition, spectrogram-based approaches do not achieve sufficient granularity level as they are based on object detection performed on pixels and are based on rectangular bounding boxes. For this reason, we propose a completely novel approach based on semantic spectrum segmentation, where multiple signals are simultaneously classified and localized in both time and frequency at the I/Q level. Conversely from the state-of-the-art computer vision algorithm, we add non-local blocks to combine the spatial features of signals, and thus achieve better performance. In addition, we propose a novel data generation approach where a limited set of easy-to-collect real-world wireless signals are ``stitched together'' to generate large-scale, wideband, and diverse datasets. Experimental results obtained on multiple testbeds (including the Arena testbed) using multiple antennas, multiple sampling frequencies, and multiple radios over the course of 3 days show that our approach classifies and localizes signals with a mean intersection over union (IOU) of 96.70% across 5 wireless protocols while performing in real-time with a latency of 2.6 ms. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach based on non-local blocks achieves 7% more accuracy when segmenting the most challenging signals with respect to the state-of-the-art U-Net algorithm. We will release our 17 GB dataset and code.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Implicit Neural Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01409v5)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing frameworks for image stitching often provide visually reasonable stitchings. However, they suffer from blurry artifacts and disparities in illumination, depth level, etc. Although the recent learning-based stitchings relax such disparities, the required methods impose sacrifice of image qualities failing to capture high-frequency details for stitched images. To address the problem, we propose a novel approach, implicit Neural Image Stitching (NIS) that extends arbitrary-scale super-resolution. Our method estimates Fourier coefficients of images for quality-enhancing warps. Then, the suggested model blends color mismatches and misalignment in the latent space and decodes the features into RGB values of stitched images. Our experiments show that our approach achieves improvement in resolving the low-definition imaging of the previous deep image stitching with favorable accelerated image-enhancing methods.

| **[SPnet: Estimating Garment Sewing Patterns from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16264v1)** | 2023-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel method for reconstructing 3D garment models from a single image of a posed user. Previous studies that have primarily focused on accurately reconstructing garment geometries to match the input garment image may often result in unnatural-looking garments when deformed for new poses. To overcome this limitation, our approach takes a different approach by inferring the fundamental shape of the garment through sewing patterns from a single image, rather than directly reconstructing 3D garments. Our method consists of two stages. Firstly, given a single image of a posed user, it predicts the garment image worn on a T-pose, representing the baseline form of the garment. Then, it estimates the sewing pattern parameters based on the T-pose garment image. By simulating the stitching and draping of the sewing pattern using physics simulation, we can generate 3D garments that can adaptively deform to arbitrary poses. The effectiveness of our method is validated through ablation studies on the major components and a comparison with other approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

That's why, in this paper, we've devised a unique and comprehensive image-stitching pipeline that taps into OpenCV's stitching module. Our approach integrates feature-based matching, transformation estimation, and blending techniques to bring about panoramic views that are of top-tier quality - irrespective of lighting, scale or orientation differences between images. We've put our pipeline to the test with a varied dataset and found that it's very effective in enhancing scene understanding and finding real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures | None |

Here the coordination of commodities, parts and labour design the problems and produce the training sets from which 'solutions' can be synthesised. But to what extent might synthetic media, surfacing via proto-platforms such as MidJourney and OpenAI and apps such as Eleven Labs and D:ID, be understood as logistical media? This paper details synthetic media experiments with 'ChatFOS', a GPT-based bot tasked with developing a logistics design business. Using its prompt-generated media outputs, we assemble a simulation and parody of AI's emerging functionalities within logistical worlds. In the process, and with clunky 'human-in-the-loop' stitching, we illustrate how large language models become media routers or switches, governing production of image prompts, website code, promotional copy, and investor pitch scenarios. Together these elements become links chained together in media ensembles such as the corporate website or the promotional video, fuelling the fictive logistics visualisation company we have 'founded'. The processes and methods of producing speculative scenarios via ChatFOS lead us to consider how synthetic media might be re-positioned as logistical media. Our experiments probe the ways in which the media of logistics and the logistics of media are increasingly enfolded. We ask: what can a (practice-based) articulation of this double-becoming of logistics and synthetic mediality tell us about the politics and aesthetics of contemporary computation and capital?</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Constraint Model for the Satellite Image Mosaic Selection Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04210v1)** | 2023-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite imagery solutions are widely used to study and monitor different regions of the Earth. However, a single satellite image can cover only a limited area. In cases where a larger area of interest is studied, several images must be stitched together to create a single larger image, called a mosaic, that can cover the area. Today, with the increasing number of satellite images available for commercial use, selecting the images to build the mosaic is challenging, especially when the user wants to optimize one or more parameters, such as the total cost and the cloud coverage percentage in the mosaic. More precisely, for this problem the input is an area of interest, several satellite images intersecting the area, a list of requirements relative to the image and the mosaic, such as cloud coverage percentage, image resolution, and a list of objectives to optimize. We contribute to the constraint and mixed integer lineal programming formulation of this new problem, which we call the \textit{satellite image mosaic selection problem}, which is a multi-objective extension of the polygon cover problem. We propose a dataset of realistic and challenging instances, where the images were captured by the satellite constellations SPOT, Pléiades and Pléiades Neo. We evaluate and compare the two proposed models and show their efficiency for large instances, up to 200 images.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper contains minor corrections from the original document presented at the 29th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2023).

| **[Customizing 360-Degree Panoramas through Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18840v2)** | 2023-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized text-to-image (T2I) synthesis based on diffusion models has attracted significant attention in recent research. However, existing methods primarily concentrate on customizing subjects or styles, neglecting the exploration of global geometry. In this study, we propose an approach that focuses on the customization of 360-degree panoramas, which inherently possess global geometric properties, using a T2I diffusion model. To achieve this, we curate a paired image-text dataset specifically designed for the task and subsequently employ it to fine-tune a pre-trained T2I diffusion model with LoRA. Nevertheless, the fine-tuned model alone does not ensure the continuity between the leftmost and rightmost sides of the synthesized images, a crucial characteristic of 360-degree panoramas. To address this issue, we propose a method called StitchDiffusion. Specifically, we perform pre-denoising operations twice at each time step of the denoising process on the stitch block consisting of the leftmost and rightmost image regions. Furthermore, a global cropping is adopted to synthesize seamless 360-degree panoramas. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our customized model combined with the proposed StitchDiffusion in generating high-quality 360-degree panoramic images. Moreover, our customized model exhibits exceptional generalization ability in producing scenes unseen in the fine-tuning dataset.

Our key idea is to regularize the reconstruction, which is severely ill-posed and leaving significant gaps between the sparse views, by learning a set of neural templates to act as surface priors. Our method, coined DiViNet, operates in two stages. It first learns the templates, in the form of 3D Gaussian functions, across different scenes, without 3D supervision. In the reconstruction stage, our predicted templates serve as anchors to help "stitch'' the surfaces over sparse regions. We demonstrate that our approach is not only able to complete the surface geometry but also reconstructs surface details to a reasonable extent from a few disparate input views. On the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets, our approach achieves the best reconstruction quality among existing methods in the presence of such sparse views and performs on par, if not better, with competing methods when dense views are employed as inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at NeurIPS, 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[SyncDiffusion: Coherent Montage via Synchronized Joint Diffusions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05178v3)** | 2023-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable capabilities of pretrained image diffusion models have been utilized not only for generating fixed-size images but also for creating panoramas. However, naive stitching of multiple images often results in visible seams. Recent techniques have attempted to address this issue by performing joint diffusions in multiple windows and averaging latent features in overlapping regions. However, these approaches, which focus on seamless montage generation, often yield incoherent outputs by blending different scenes within a single image. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncDiffusion, a plug-and-play module that synchronizes multiple diffusions through gradient descent from a perceptual similarity loss. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the perceptual loss using the predicted denoised images at each denoising step, providing meaningful guidance for achieving coherent montages. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method produces significantly more coherent outputs compared to previous methods (66.35% vs. 33.65% in our user study) while still maintaining fidelity (as assessed by GIQA) and compatibility with the input prompt (as measured by CLIP score). We further demonstrate the versatility of our method across three plug-and-play applications: layout-guided image generation, conditional image generation and 360-degree panorama generation.

The task of seamless editing and merging of multiple NeRFs, resembling the ``Poisson blending'' in 2D image editing, remains a critical operation that is under-explored by existing work. To fill this gap, we propose SeamlessNeRF, a novel approach for seamless appearance blending of multiple NeRFs. In specific, we aim to optimize the appearance of a target radiance field in order to harmonize its merge with a source field. We propose a well-tailored optimization procedure for blending, which is constrained by 1) pinning the radiance color in the intersecting boundary area between the source and target fields and 2) maintaining the original gradient of the target. Extensive experiments validate that our approach can effectively propagate the source appearance from the boundary area to the entire target field through the gradients. To the best of our knowledge, SeamlessNeRF is the first work that introduces gradient-guided appearance editing to radiance fields, offering solutions for seamless stitching of 3D objects represented in NeRFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SIGGRAPH Asia 2023.

This paper presents a novel framework that reconstructs the texture map for 3D garments from a single image with pose. Assuming that 3D garments are modeled by stitching 2D garment sewing patterns, our specific goal is to generate a texture image for the sewing patterns. A key component of our framework, the Texture Unwarper, infers the original texture image from the input clothing image, which exhibits warping and occlusion of texture due to the user's body shape and pose. The Texture Unwarper effectively transforms between the input and output images by mapping the latent spaces of the two images. By inferring the unwarped original texture of the input garment, our method helps reconstruct 3D garment models that can show high-quality texture images realistically deformed for new poses. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through a comparison with other methods and ablation studies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Residual Elastic Warps for Image Stitching under Dirichlet Boundary Condition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01406v3)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trendy suggestions for learning-based elastic warps enable the deep image stitchings to align images exposed to large parallax errors. Despite the remarkable alignments, the methods struggle with occasional holes or discontinuity between overlapping and non-overlapping regions of a target image as the applied training strategy mostly focuses on overlap region alignment. As a result, they require additional modules such as seam finder and image inpainting for hiding discontinuity and filling holes, respectively. In this work, we suggest Recurrent Elastic Warps (REwarp) that address the problem with Dirichlet boundary condition and boost performances by residual learning for recurrent misalign correction. Specifically, REwarp predicts a homography and a Thin-plate Spline (TPS) under the boundary constraint for discontinuity and hole-free image stitching. Our experiments show the favorable aligns and the competitive computational costs of REwarp compared to the existing stitching methods.

| **[$H$-RANSAC, an algorithmic variant for Homography image transform from featureless point sets: application to video-based football analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04912v1)** | 2023-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating homography matrix between two images has various applications like image stitching or image mosaicing and spatial information retrieval from multiple camera views, but has been proved to be a complicated problem, especially in cases of radically different camera poses and zoom factors. Many relevant approaches have been proposed, utilizing direct feature based, or deep learning methodologies. In this paper, we propose a generalized RANSAC algorithm, H-RANSAC, to retrieve homography image transformations from sets of points without descriptive local feature vectors and point pairing. We allow the points to be optionally labelled in two classes. We propose a robust criterion that rejects implausible point selection before each iteration of RANSAC, based on the type of the quadrilaterals formed by random point pair selection (convex or concave and (non)-self-intersecting). A similar post-hoc criterion rejects implausible homography transformations is included at the end of each iteration. The expected maximum iterations of $H$-RANSAC are derived for different probabilities of success, according to the number of points per image and per class, and the percentage of outliers. The proposed methodology is tested on a large dataset of images acquired by 12 cameras during real football matches, where radically different views at each timestamp are to be matched. Comparisons with state-of-the-art implementations of RANSAC combined with classic and deep learning image salient point detection indicates the superiority of the proposed $H$-RANSAC, in terms of average reprojection error and number of successfully processed pairs of frames, rendering it the method of choice in cases of image homography alignment with few tens of points, while local features are not available, or not descriptive enough.

| **[Light Field Depth Estimation via Stitched Epipolar Plane Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15201v3)** | 2023-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation is a fundamental problem in light field processing. Epipolar-plane image (EPI)-based methods often encounter challenges such as low accuracy in slope computation due to discretization errors and limited angular resolution. Besides, existing methods perform well in most regions but struggle to produce sharp edges in occluded regions and resolve ambiguities in texture-less regions. To address these issues, we propose the concept of stitched-EPI (SEPI) to enhance slope computation. SEPI achieves this by shifting and concatenating lines from different EPIs that correspond to the same 3D point. Moreover, we introduce the half-SEPI algorithm, which focuses exclusively on the non-occluded portion of lines to handle occlusion. Additionally, we present a depth propagation strategy aimed at improving depth estimation in texture-less regions. This strategy involves determining the depth of such regions by progressing from the edges towards the interior, prioritizing accurate regions over coarse regions. Through extensive experimental evaluations and ablation studies, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results demonstrate its superior ability to generate more accurate and robust depth maps across all regions compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The straightforward image stitching approach will cause temporal flicking and color inconstancy when it is applied to the video stitching task. Besides, inaccurate camera parameters will cause artifacts in the image warping. In this paper, we propose a real-time system to stitch multiple video sequences into a panoramic video, which is based on GPU accelerated color correction and frame warping without accurate camera parameters. We extend the traditional 2D-Matrix (2D-M) color correction approach and a present spatio-temporal 3D-Matrix (3D-M) color correction method for the overlap local regions with online color balancing using a piecewise function on global frames. Furthermore, we use pairwise homography matrices given by coarse camera calibration for global warping followed by accurate local warping based on the optical flow. Experimental results show that our system can generate highquality panorama videos in real time.</p></details> |  | None |

This seldom-studied task faces two major challenges: 1) Preserving the head and body from various sources while generating a seamless transition region. 2) No paired head swapping dataset and benchmark so far. In this paper, we propose a semantic-mixing diffusion model for head swapping (HS-Diffusion) which consists of a latent diffusion model (LDM) and a semantic layout generator. We blend the semantic layouts of source head and source body, and then inpaint the transition region by the semantic layout generator, achieving a coarse-grained head swapping. Semantic-mixing LDM can further implement a fine-grained head swapping with the inpainted layout as condition by a progressive fusion process, while preserving head and body with high-quality reconstruction. To this end, we propose a semantic calibration strategy for natural inpainting and a neck alignment for geometric realism. Importantly, we construct a new image-based head swapping benchmark and design two tailor-designed metrics (Mask-FID and Focal-FID). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

The primary challenge of this task is to explore the relations between multi-spectral images for aligning and integrating multi-view scenes. Capitalizing on the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in modeling feature relationships, we propose a spatial graph reasoning based multi-spectral image stitching method that effectively distills the deformation and integration of multi-spectral images across different viewpoints. To accomplish this, we embed multi-scale complementary features from the same view position into a set of nodes. The correspondence across different views is learned through powerful dense feature embeddings, where both inter- and intra-correlations are developed to exploit cross-view matching and enhance inner feature disparity. By introducing long-range coherence along spatial and channel dimensions, the complementarity of pixel relations and channel interdependencies aids in the reconstruction of aligned multi-view features, generating informative and reliable wide FOV scenes. Moreover, we release a challenging dataset named ChaMS, comprising both real-world and synthetic sets with significant parallax, providing a new option for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

In this paper, we explore 360° images for visual object tracking and perceive new challenges caused by large distortion, stitching artifacts, and other unique attributes of 360° images. To alleviate these problems, we take advantage of novel representations of target localization, i.e., bounding field-of-view, and then introduce a general 360 tracking framework that can adopt typical trackers for omnidirectional tracking. More importantly, we propose a new large-scale omnidirectional tracking benchmark dataset, 360VOT, in order to facilitate future research. 360VOT contains 120 sequences with up to 113K high-resolution frames in equirectangular projection.

| **[A Stronger Stitching Algorithm for Fisheye Images based on Deblurring and Registration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11997v1)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fisheye lens, which is suitable for panoramic imaging, has the prominent advantage of a large field of view and low cost. However, the fisheye image has a severe geometric distortion which may interfere with the stage of image registration and stitching. Aiming to resolve this drawback, we devise a stronger stitching algorithm for fisheye images by combining the traditional image processing method with deep learning. In the stage of fisheye image correction, we propose the Attention-based Nonlinear Activation Free Network (ANAFNet) to deblur fisheye images corrected by Zhang calibration method. Specifically, ANAFNet adopts the classical single-stage U-shaped architecture based on convolutional neural networks with soft-attention technique and it can restore a sharp image from a blurred image effectively. In the part of image registration, we propose the ORB-FREAK-GMS (OFG), a comprehensive image matching algorithm, to improve the accuracy of image registration. Experimental results demonstrate that panoramic images of superior quality stitching by fisheye images can be obtained through our method.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Parallax-Tolerant Unsupervised Deep Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08207v2)** | 2023-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional image stitching approaches tend to leverage increasingly complex geometric features (point, line, edge, etc.) for better performance. However, these hand-crafted features are only suitable for specific natural scenes with adequate geometric structures. In contrast, deep stitching schemes overcome the adverse conditions by adaptively learning robust semantic features, but they cannot handle large-parallax cases due to homography-based registration. To solve these issues, we propose UDIS++, a parallax-tolerant unsupervised deep image stitching technique. First, we propose a robust and flexible warp to model the image registration from global homography to local thin-plate spline motion. It provides accurate alignment for overlapping regions and shape preservation for non-overlapping regions by joint optimization concerning alignment and distortion. Subsequently, to improve the generalization capability, we design a simple but effective iterative strategy to enhance the warp adaption in cross-dataset and cross-resolution applications. Finally, to further eliminate the parallax artifacts, we propose to composite the stitched image seamlessly by unsupervised learning for seam-driven composition masks. Compared with existing methods, our solution is parallax-tolerant and free from laborious designs of complicated geometric features for specific scenes. Extensive experiments show our superiority over the SoTA methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[Deep Seam Prediction for Image Stitching Based on Selection Consistency Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05027v2)** | 2023-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching is to construct panoramic images with wider field of vision (FOV) from some images captured from different viewing positions. To solve the problem of fusion ghosting in the stitched image, seam-driven methods avoid the misalignment area to fuse images by predicting the best seam. Currently, as standard tools of the OpenCV library, dynamic programming (DP) and GraphCut (GC) are still the only commonly used seam prediction methods despite the fact that they were both proposed two decades ago. However, GC can get excellent seam quality but poor real-time performance while DP method has good efficiency but poor seam quality. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based seam prediction method (DSeam) for the sake of high seam quality with high efficiency. To overcome the difficulty of the seam description in network and no GroundTruth for training we design a selective consistency loss combining the seam shape constraint and seam quality constraint to supervise the network learning. By the constraint of the selection of consistency loss, we implicitly defined the mask boundaries as seams and transform seam prediction into mask prediction. To our knowledge, the proposed DSeam is the first deep learning based seam prediction method for image stitching. Extensive experimental results well demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Dseam method which is 15 times faster than the classic GC seam prediction method in OpenCV 2.4.9 with similar seam quality.</p></details> |  | None |

To simplify OD application process, we developed Ladder - a software that provides users with a friendly graphic user interface (GUI) that allows for efficient labelling of training datasets, training OD models, and deploying the trained model. Ladder was designed with an interactive recurrent framework that leverages predictions from a pre-trained OD model as the initial image labeling. After adding human labels, the newly labeled images can be added into the training data to retrain the OD model. With the same GUI, users can also deploy well-trained OD models by loading the model weight file to detect new images. We used Ladder to develop a deep learning model to access wheat stripe rust in RGB (red, green, blue) images taken by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Ladder employs OD to directly evaluate different severity levels of wheat stripe rust in field images, eliminating the need for photo stitching process for UAVs-based images. The accuracy for low, medium and high severity scores were 72%, 50% and 80%, respectively. This case demonstrates how Ladder empowers OD in precision agriculture and crop breeding.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures | None |

Our computational microscope, termed STARCAM (Scanning Topographic All-in-focus Reconstruction with a Computational Array Microscope), features a parallelized, 54-camera architecture with 3-axis translation to capture, for each sample of interest, a multi-dimensional, 2.1-terabyte (TB) dataset, consisting of a total of 224,640 9.4-megapixel images. We developed a self-supervised neural network-based algorithm for 3D reconstruction and stitching that jointly estimates an all-in-focus photometric composite and 3D height map across the entire field of view, using multi-view stereo information and image sharpness as a focal metric. The memory-efficient, compressed differentiable representation offered by the neural network effectively enables joint participation of the entire multi-TB dataset during the reconstruction process. To demonstrate the broad utility of our new computational microscope, we applied STARCAM to a variety of decimeter-scale objects, with applications ranging from cultural heritage to industrial inspection.</p></details> |  | None |

However, incorrect matches may still exist. Thus, a novel sampling scheme, Pentagon-Match (PMatch), is proposed in this work to verify the correctness of initially matched keypoints using pentagons randomly sampled from them. By ensuring shape and location of these pentagons are view-invariant with various evaluations of cross-ratio (CR), incorrect matches of keypoint can be identified easily with homography estimated from correctly matched pentagons. Experimental results show that highly accurate estimation of homography can be obtained efficiently for planar scenes of the HPatches dataset, based on keypoint matching results provided by LoFTR. Besides, accurate outlier identification for the above matching results and possible extension of the approach for multi-plane situation are also demonstrated.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2211.03007</p></details> | None |

We frequently rely on volumetric data to segment medical images, necessitating the use of 3D architectures, which are commended for their capacity to capture interslice context. However, because of the 3D convolutions, max pooling, up-convolutions, and other operations utilized in these networks, these architectures are often more inefficient in terms of time and computation than their 2D equivalents. Furthermore, there are few 3D pretrained model weights, and pretraining is often difficult. We present a simple yet effective 2D method to handle 3D data while efficiently embedding the 3D knowledge during training. We propose transforming volumetric data into 2D super images and segmenting with 2D networks to solve these challenges. Our method generates a super-resolution image by stitching slices side by side in the 3D image. We expect deep neural networks to capture and learn these properties spatially despite losing depth information. This work aims to present a novel perspective when dealing with volumetric data, and we test the hypothesis using CNN and ViT networks as well as self-supervised pretraining. While attaining equal, if not superior, results to 3D networks utilizing only 2D counterparts, the model complexity is reduced by around threefold. Because volumetric data is relatively scarce, we anticipate that our approach will entice more studies, particularly in medical imaging analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

But in computer vision, the difficulties for in-context learning lie in that tasks vary significantly in the output representations, thus it is unclear how to define the general-purpose task prompts that the vision model can understand and transfer to out-of-domain tasks. In this work, we present Painter, a generalist model which addresses these obstacles with an "image"-centric solution, that is, to redefine the output of core vision tasks as images, and specify task prompts as also images. With this idea, our training process is extremely simple, which performs standard masked image modeling on the stitch of input and output image pairs. This makes the model capable of performing tasks conditioned on visible image patches. Thus, during inference, we can adopt a pair of input and output images from the same task as the input condition, to indicate which task to perform. Without bells and whistles, our generalist Painter can achieve competitive performance compared to well-established task-specific models, on seven representative vision tasks ranging from high-level visual understanding to low-level image processing. In addition, Painter significantly outperforms recent generalist models on several challenging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2023.

| **[ECON: Explicit Clothed humans Optimized via Normal integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07422v2)** | 2023-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of deep learning, artist-curated scans, and Implicit Functions (IF), is enabling the creation of detailed, clothed, 3D humans from images. However, existing methods are far from perfect. IF-based methods recover free-form geometry, but produce disembodied limbs or degenerate shapes for novel poses or clothes. To increase robustness for these cases, existing work uses an explicit parametric body model to constrain surface reconstruction, but this limits the recovery of free-form surfaces such as loose clothing that deviates from the body. What we want is a method that combines the best properties of implicit representation and explicit body regularization. To this end, we make two key observations: (1) current networks are better at inferring detailed 2D maps than full-3D surfaces, and (2) a parametric model can be seen as a "canvas" for stitching together detailed surface patches. Based on these, our method, ECON, has three main steps: (1) It infers detailed 2D normal maps for the front and back side of a clothed person. (2) From these, it recovers 2.5D front and back surfaces, called d-BiNI, that are equally detailed, yet incomplete, and registers these w.r.t. each other with the help of a SMPL-X body mesh recovered from the image. (3) It "inpaints" the missing geometry between d-BiNI surfaces. If the face and hands are noisy, they can optionally be replaced with the ones of SMPL-X. As a result, ECON infers high-fidelity 3D humans even in loose clothes and challenging poses. This goes beyond previous methods, according to the quantitative evaluation on the CAPE and Renderpeople datasets. Perceptual studies also show that ECON's perceived realism is better by a large margin.

We propose FingerSLAM, a closed-loop factor graph-based pose estimator that combines local tactile sensing at finger-tip and global vision sensing from a wrist-mount camera. FingerSLAM is constructed with two constituent pose estimators: a multi-pass refined tactile-based pose estimator that captures movements from detailed local textures, and a single-pass vision-based pose estimator that predicts from a global view of the object. We also design a loop closure mechanism that actively matches current vision and tactile images to previously stored key-frames to reduce accumulated error. FingerSLAM incorporates the two sensing modalities of tactile and vision, as well as the loop closure mechanism with a factor graph-based optimization framework. Such a framework produces an optimized pose estimation solution that is more accurate than the standalone estimators. The estimated poses are then used to reconstruct the shape of the unknown object incrementally by stitching the local point clouds recovered from tactile images. We train our system on real-world data collected with 20 objects. We demonstrate reliable visuo-tactile pose estimation and shape reconstruction through quantitative and qualitative real-world evaluations on 6 objects that are unseen during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and accepted to 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2023)</p></details> | None |

Ideally, the distribution of the data points in the latent space should depend only on the task, the data, the loss, and other architecture-specific constraints. However, factors such as the random weights initialization, training hyperparameters, or other sources of randomness in the training phase may induce incoherent latent spaces that hinder any form of reuse. Nevertheless, we empirically observe that, under the same data and modeling choices, the angles between the encodings within distinct latent spaces do not change. In this work, we propose the latent similarity between each sample and a fixed set of anchors as an alternative data representation, demonstrating that it can enforce the desired invariances without any additional training. We show how neural architectures can leverage these relative representations to guarantee, in practice, invariance to latent isometries and rescalings, effectively enabling latent space communication: from zero-shot model stitching to latent space comparison between diverse settings. We extensively validate the generalization capability of our approach on different datasets, spanning various modalities (images, text, graphs), tasks (e.g., classification, reconstruction) and architectures (e.g., CNNs, GCNs, transformers).</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2023 notable top 5%, 26 pages, 11 figures, 18 tables</p></details> | None |

Challenges inevitably arise when the scene is non-planar and the camera baseline is wide, since parallax becomes not negligible in such cases. In this paper, we propose a novel NIS method using depth maps, which generates natural-looking mosaics against parallax in both overlapping and non-overlapping regions. Firstly, we construct a robust fitting method to filter out the outliers in feature matches and estimate the epipolar geometry between input images. Then, we draw a triangulation of the target image and estimate multiple local homographies, one per triangle, based on the locations of their vertices, the rectified depth values and the epipolar geometry. Finally, the warping image is rendered by the backward mapping of piece-wise homographies. Panorama is then produced via average blending and image inpainting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only provides accurate alignment in the overlapping regions but also virtual naturalness in the non-overlapping region.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

The newly produced image is unseen and is generated from the algorithm itself. Balancing the structure and style components has been the major challenge that other state-of-the-art algorithms have tried to solve. Despite all the efforts, it's still a major challenge to apply the artistic style that was originally created on top of the structure of the content image while maintaining consistency. In this work, we solved these problems by using a Deep Learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks. Our implementation will first extract foreground from the background using the pre-trained Detectron 2 model from the content image, and then apply the Arbitrary Style Transfer technique that is used in SANet. Once we have the two styled images, we will stitch the two chunks of images after the process of style transfer for the complete end piece.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures | None |

Unlike typical layout estimation methods, MVRackLay estimates multi-layered layouts, wherein each layer corresponds to the layout of a shelf within a rack. Given a sequence of images of a warehouse scene, a dual-headed Convolutional-LSTM architecture outputs segmented racks, the front and the top view layout of each shelf within a rack. With minimal effort, such an output is transformed into a 3D rendering of all racks, shelves and objects on the shelves, giving an accurate 3D depiction of the entire warehouse scene in terms of racks, shelves and the number of objects on each shelf. MVRackLay generalizes to a diverse set of warehouse scenes with varying number of objects on each shelf, number of shelves and in the presence of other such racks in the background. Further, MVRackLay shows superior performance vis-a-vis its single view counterpart, RackLay, in layout accuracy, quantized in terms of the mean IoU and mAP metrics. We also showcase a multi-view stitching of the 3D layouts resulting in a representation of the warehouse scene with respect to a global reference frame akin to a rendering of the scene from a SLAM pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such work to portray a 3D rendering of a warehouse scene in terms of its semantic components - Racks, Shelves and Objects - all from a single monocular camera.</p></details> |  | None |

However, such training requires datasets composed of pairs of corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth targets. Unfortunately, such data is not available in many applications. For the task of image denoising in which the noise statistics is unknown, several self-supervised training methods have been proposed for overcoming this difficulty. Some of these require knowledge of the noise model, while others assume that the contaminating noise is uncorrelated, both assumptions are too limiting for many practical needs. This work proposes a novel self-supervised training technique suitable for the removal of unknown correlated noise. The proposed approach neither requires knowledge of the noise model nor access to ground truth targets. The input to our algorithm consists of easily captured bursts of noisy shots. Our algorithm constructs artificial patch-craft images from these bursts by patch matching and stitching, and the obtained crafted images are used as targets for the training. Our method does not require registration of the images within the burst. We evaluate the proposed framework through extensive experiments with synthetic and real image noise.</p></details> |  | None |

This unified model borrows from the basic Dual Recursive Network (DRN) architecture developed by Cai et al. The proposed model makes use of cross-stitch units that enable multi-task learning across two separate DRN models, each tasked for single image deraining and desnowing, respectively. By fixing cross-stitch units at several layers of basic task-specific DRN networks, we perform multi-task learning over the two separate DRN models. To enable blind image restoration, on top of these structures we employ a simple neural fusion scheme which merges the output of each DRN. The separate task-specific DRN models and the fusion scheme are simultaneously trained by enforcing local and global supervision. Local supervision is applied on the two DRN submodules, and global supervision is applied on the data fusion submodule of the proposed model. Consequently, we both enable feature sharing across task-specific DRN models and control the image restoration behavior of the DRN submodules. An ablation study shows the strength of the hypothesized CMUDRN model, and experiments indicate that its performance is comparable or better than baseline DRN models on the single image deraining and desnowing tasks. Moreover, CMUDRN enables blind image restoration for the two underlying image restoration tasks, by unifying task-specific image restoration pipelines via a naive parametric fusion scheme.

Accordingly, a geometrically constrained algorithm is proposed in this work to verify the correctness of initially matched SIFT keypoints based on view-invariant cross-ratios (CRs). By randomly forming pentagons from these keypoints and matching their shape and location among images with CRs, robust planar region estimation can be achieved efficiently for the above verification, while correct and incorrect matches of keypoints can be examined easily with respect to those shape and location matched pentagons. Experimental results show that satisfactory results can be obtained for various scenes with single as well as multiple planar regions.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods simply stitch query features with independent support prototypes and segment the query image by feeding the mixed features to a decoder. Although significant improvements have been achieved, existing methods are still face class biases due to class variants and background confusion. In this paper, we propose a joint framework that combines more valuable class-aware and class-agnostic alignment guidance to facilitate the segmentation. Specifically, we design a hybrid alignment module which establishes multi-scale query-support correspondences to mine the most relevant class-aware information for each query image from the corresponding support features. In addition, we explore utilizing base-classes knowledge to generate class-agnostic prior mask which makes a distinction between real background and foreground by highlighting all object regions, especially those of unseen classes. By jointly aggregating class-aware and class-agnostic alignment guidance, better segmentation performances are obtained on query images. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed joint framework performs better, especially on the 1-shot setting.</p></details> |  | None |

As traditional neural network-based methods have limitations in the output image sizes (up to 1024x512) due to GPU memory constraints, both 360MonoDepth and our method rely on stitching multiple perspective disparity or depth images to come out a unified panoramic depth map. However, to achieve globally consistent stitching, 360MonoDepth relied on solving extensive disparity map alignment and Poisson-based blending problems, leading to high computation time. Instead, we propose to use an existing panoramic depth map (computed in real-time by any panorama-based method) as the common target for the individual perspective depth maps to register to. This key idea made producing globally consistent stitching results from a straightforward task. Our experiments show that our method generates qualitatively better results than existing panorama-based methods, and further outperforms them quantitatively on datasets unseen by these methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2023, to appear</p></details> | None |

Our main idea is to construct an animatable 3-D human model and try-on different clothes in a 3-D virtual environment. The existing frame by frame volumetric reconstruction of 3-D human models are highly resource-demanding and do not allow clothes switching. Moreover, existing virtual fit-on systems also lack realism due to predominantly being 2-D or not using user's features in the reconstruction. These shortcomings are due to either the human body or clothing model being 2-D or not having the user's facial features in the dressed model. We solve these problems by manipulating a parametric representation of the 3-D human body model and stitching a head model reconstructed from the actual image. Fitting the 3-D clothing models on the parameterized human model is also adjustable to the body shape of the input image. Our reconstruction results, in comparison with recent existing work, are more visually-pleasing.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, there is a growing belief that data is unnecessary in OPaI. However, we obtain an opposite conclusion by ablation experiments in two representative OPaI methods, SNIP and GraSP. Specifically, we find that informative data is crucial to enhancing pruning performance. In this paper, we propose two novel methods, Discriminative One-shot Network Pruning (DOP) and Super Stitching, to prune the network by high-level visual discriminative image patches. Our contributions are as follows. (1) Extensive experiments reveal that OPaI is data-dependent.

However, the most challenging point in deep learning-based stitching is to obtain pairs of input images with a narrow field of view and ground truth images with a wide field of view captured from real-world scenes. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a weakly-supervised learning mechanism to train the stitching model without requiring genuine ground truth images. In addition, we propose a stitching model that takes multiple real-world fisheye images as inputs and creates a 360 output image in an equirectangular projection format. In particular, our model consists of color consistency corrections, warping, and blending, and is trained by perceptual and SSIM losses. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on two real-world stitching datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV2022 (poster)</p></details> | None |
| **[Closed-loop Feedback Registration for Consecutive Images of Moving Flexible Targets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10772v1)** | 2022-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancement of imaging techniques enables consecutive image sequences to be acquired for quality monitoring of manufacturing production lines. Registration for these image sequences is essential for in-line pattern inspection and metrology, e.g., in the printing process of flexible electronics. However, conventional image registration algorithms cannot produce accurate results when the images contain many similar and deformable patterns in the manufacturing process. Such a failure originates from a fact that the conventional algorithms only use the spatial and pixel intensity information for registration. Considering the nature of temporal continuity and consecution of the product images, in this paper, we propose a closed-loop feedback registration algorithm for matching and stitching the deformable printed patterns on a moving flexible substrate. The algorithm leverages the temporal and spatial relationships of the consecutive images and the continuity of the image sequence for fast, accurate, and robust point matching. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can find more matching point pairs with a lower root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms while offering significant improvements to running time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LWGNet: Learned Wirtinger Gradients for Fourier Ptychographic Phase Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04283v2)** | 2022-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) is an imaging procedure that overcomes the traditional limit on Space-Bandwidth Product (SBP) of conventional microscopes through computational means. It utilizes multiple images captured using a low numerical aperture (NA) objective and enables high-resolution phase imaging through frequency domain stitching. Existing FPM reconstruction methods can be broadly categorized into two approaches: iterative optimization based methods, which are based on the physics of the forward imaging model, and data-driven methods which commonly employ a feed-forward deep learning framework. We propose a hybrid model-driven residual network that combines the knowledge of the forward imaging system with a deep data-driven network. Our proposed architecture, LWGNet, unrolls traditional Wirtinger flow optimization algorithm into a novel neural network design that enhances the gradient images through complex convolutional blocks. Unlike other conventional unrolling techniques, LWGNet uses fewer stages while performing at par or even better than existing traditional and deep learning techniques, particularly, for low-cost and low dynamic range CMOS sensors. This improvement in performance for low-bit depth and low-cost sensors has the potential to bring down the cost of FPM imaging setup significantly. Finally, we show consistently improved performance on our collected real data.</p></details> |  | None |

Manual realisation of those tasks is time-consuming and the quality is highly dependent on the level of expertise of the physician. To mitigate that laborious task, automatic tools have been developed where the majority of solutions are supervised techniques. However, in medical domain, the strong assumption of having a well-representative ground truth is far from being realistic. To overcome this challenge, unsupervised techniques have been investigated. However, they are still limited in performance and they fail to produce plausible results. In this work, we propose a novel unified unsupervised framework for image registration and segmentation that we called PC-SwinMorph. The core of our framework is two patch-based strategies, where we demonstrate that patch representation is key for performance gain. We first introduce a patch-based contrastive strategy that enforces locality conditions and richer feature representation. Secondly, we utilise a 3D window/shifted-window multi-head self-attention module as a patch stitching strategy to eliminate artifacts from the patch splitting. We demonstrate, through a set of numerical and visual results, that our technique outperforms current state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Currently, analyzing the integrated descriptor of probabilities or feature maps from massive local patches encoded by ResNet classifier is the main manner for WSI-level prediction. Feature representations of the sparse and tiny lesion cells in cervical slides, however, are still challenging, while the unused location representations are available to supply the semantics classification. This study designs a novel and efficient framework with a new module InCNet constructed lightweight model YOLCO (You Only Look Cytology Once). It directly extracts feature inside the single cell (cluster) instead of the traditional way that from image tile with a fixed size. The InCNet (Inline Connection Network) enriches the multi-scale connectivity without efficiency loss. The proposal allows the input size enlarged to megapixel that can stitch the WSI by the average repeats decreased from $10^3\sim10^4$ to $10^1\sim10^2$ for collecting features and predictions at two scales. Based on Transformer for classifying the integrated multi-scale multi-task WSI features, the experimental results appear $0.872$ AUC score better than the best conventional model on our dataset ($n$=2,019) from four scanners.

With the development of advanced driver assistance systems~(ADAS) and their applications in autonomous vehicles, experimenting with different scenarios becomes a challenge. Although the photo-realistic street scenes can be synthesized by image-to-image translation methods, which cannot produce coherent scenes due to the lack of 3D information. In this paper, a large-scale neural rendering method is proposed to synthesize the autonomous driving scene~(READ), which makes it possible to synthesize large-scale driving scenarios on a PC through a variety of sampling schemes. In order to represent driving scenarios, we propose an ω rendering network to learn neural descriptors from sparse point clouds. Our model can not only synthesize realistic driving scenes but also stitch and edit driving scenes.

Multiple micromachined micro lens units cover the whole elastic touching layer and provide a stitched clear tactile image, enabling high spatial resolution with a thin thickness of 5 mm. The thermal reflow and soft lithography method ensure the uniform spherical profile and smooth surface of micro lens.

In particular, the current state-of-the-art model GIRAFFE can control each object's rotation, translation, scale, and scene camera pose without corresponding supervision. However, GIRAFFE only operates well when the image resolution is low. We propose GIRAFFE HD, a high-resolution 3D-aware generative model that inherits all of GIRAFFE's controllable features while generating high-quality, high-resolution images ($512^2$ resolution and above). The key idea is to leverage a style-based neural renderer, and to independently generate the foreground and background to force their disentanglement while imposing consistency constraints to stitch them together to composite a coherent final image. We demonstrate state-of-the-art 3D controllable high-resolution image generation on multiple natural image datasets.</p></details> | CVPR 2022 | None |

Previous methods suffered from overfitting to the training resolution and deterministic generation. This paper proposes a completion method using a transformer for scene modeling and novel methods to improve the properties of a 360-degree image on the output image. Specifically, we use CompletionNets with a transformer to perform diverse completions and AdjustmentNet to match color, stitching, and resolution with an input image, enabling inference at any resolution. To improve the properties of a 360-degree image on an output image, we also propose WS-perceptual loss and circular inference. Thorough experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. For example, compared to SOTA methods, our method completes images 16 times larger in resolution and achieves 1.7 times lower Frechet inception distance (FID). Furthermore, we propose a pipeline that uses the completion results for lighting and background of 3DCG scenes. Our plausible background completion enables perceptually natural results in the application of inserting virtual objects with specular surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2022.

To deal with this problem, existing image rectangling methods devote to searching an initial mesh and optimizing a target mesh to form the mesh deformation in two stages. Then rectangular images can be generated by warping stitched images. However, these solutions only work for images with rich linear structures, leading to noticeable distortions for portraits and landscapes with non-linear objects. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing the first deep learning solution to image rectangling. Concretely, we predefine a rigid target mesh and only estimate an initial mesh to form the mesh deformation, contributing to a compact one-stage solution. The initial mesh is predicted using a fully convolutional network with a residual progressive regression strategy. To obtain results with high content fidelity, a comprehensive objective function is proposed to simultaneously encourage the boundary rectangular, mesh shape-preserving, and content perceptually natural. Besides, we build the first image stitching rectangling dataset with a large diversity in irregular boundaries and scenes.

Many recent 3D facial texture reconstruction and pose manipulation from a single image approaches still rely on large and clean face datasets to train image-to-image Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Yet the collection of such a large scale high-resolution 3D texture dataset is still very costly and difficult to maintain age/ethnicity balance. Moreover, regression-based approaches suffer from generalization to the in-the-wild conditions and are unable to fine-tune to a target-image. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for one-shot 3D facial texture completion that does not require large-scale texture datasets, but rather harnesses the knowledge stored in 2D face generators. The proposed approach rotates an input image in 3D and fill-in the unseen regions by reconstructing the rotated image in a 2D face generator, based on the visible parts. Finally, we stitch the most visible textures at different angles in the UV image-plane. Further, we frontalize the target image by projecting the completed texture into the generator. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the completed UV textures and frontalized images are of high quality, resembles the original identity, can be used to train a texture GAN model for 3DMM fitting and improve pose-invariant face recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/barisgecer/OSTeC</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/barisgecer/OSTeC) |
| **[Human Face Recognition from Part of a Facial Image based on Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05601v1)** | 2022-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the current techniques for face recognition require the presence of a full face of the person to be recognized, and this situation is difficult to achieve in practice, the required person may appear with a part of his face, which requires prediction of the part that did not appear. Most of the current forecasting processes are done by what is known as image interpolation, which does not give reliable results, especially if the missing part is large. In this work, we adopted the process of stitching the face by completing the missing part with the flipping of the part shown in the picture, depending on the fact that the human face is characterized by symmetry in most cases. To create a complete model, two facial recognition methods were used to prove the efficiency of the algorithm. The selected face recognition algorithms that are applied here are Eigenfaces and geometrical methods. Image stitching is the process during which distinctive photographic images are combined to make a complete scene or a high-resolution image. Several images are integrated to form a wide-angle panoramic image. The quality of the image stitching is determined by calculating the similarity among the stitched image and original images and by the presence of the seam lines through the stitched images. The Eigenfaces approach utilizes PCA calculation to reduce the feature vector dimensions. It provides an effective approach for discovering the lower-dimensional space. In addition, to enable the proposed algorithm to recognize the face, it also ensures a fast and effective way of classifying faces. The phase of feature extraction is followed by the classifier phase.</p></details> |  | None |

Comprehensive understanding and clinical diagnosis rely on co-registration with the gold standard, histology images, which is extremely challenging due to the difference of both images. Here, we show an unsupervised image-to-image translation network that significantly improves the success of the co-registration using a conventional optimisation-based regression network, applicable to autofluorescence lifetime images at different emission wavelengths. A preliminary blind comparison by experienced researchers shows the superiority of our method on co-registration. The results also indicate that the approach is applicable to various image formats, like fluorescence intensity images. With the registration, stitching outcomes illustrate the distinct differences of the spectral lifetime across an unstained tissue, enabling macro-level rapid visual identification of lung cancer and cellular-level characterisation of cell variants and common types. The approach could be effortlessly extended to lifetime images beyond this range and other staining technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, 5 equations, 1 table</p></details> | None |

In this study, we collect a large image data set to re-label them as a multi-label image classification problem so as to identify smoke and flame simultaneously. In order to solve the generalization ability of the detection model on account of the movable fluid objects with uncertain shapes like fire and smoke, and their not compactible natures as well as the complex backgrounds with high variations, we propose a data augment method by random image stitch to deploy resizing, deforming, position variation, and background altering so as to enlarge the view of the learner. Moreover, we propose a self-learning data augment method by using the class activation map to extract the highly trustable region as new data source of positive examples to further enhance the data augment. By the mutual reinforcement between the data augment and the detection model that are performed iteratively, both modules make progress in an evolutionary manner. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively improve the generalization performance of the model for concurrent smoke and fire detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Road-boundary is one of the most important information contained in HD maps since it distinguishes between road areas and off-road areas, which can guide vehicles to drive within road areas. But it is labor-intensive to annotate road boundaries for HD maps at the city scale. To enable automatic HD map annotation, current work uses semantic segmentation or iterative graph growing for road-boundary detection. However, the former could not ensure topological correctness since it works at the pixel level, while the latter suffers from inefficiency and drifting issues. To provide a solution to the aforementioned problems, in this letter, we propose a novel system termed csBoundary to automatically detect road boundaries at the city scale for HD map annotation. Our network takes as input an aerial image patch, and directly infers the continuous road-boundary graph (i.e., vertices and edges) from this image. To generate the city-scale road-boundary graph, we stitch the obtained graphs from all the image patches. Our csBoundary is evaluated and compared on a public benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate our superiority.

| **[Pixel-wise Deep Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06171v1)** | 2021-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching aims at stitching the images taken from different viewpoints into an image with a wider field of view. Existing methods warp the target image to the reference image using the estimated warp function, and a homography is one of the most commonly used warping functions. However, when images have large parallax due to non-planar scenes and translational motion of a camera, the homography cannot fully describe the mapping between two images. Existing approaches based on global or local homography estimation are not free from this problem and suffer from undesired artifacts due to parallax. In this paper, instead of relying on the homography-based warp, we propose a novel deep image stitching framework exploiting the pixel-wise warp field to handle the large-parallax problem. The proposed deep image stitching framework consists of two modules: Pixel-wise Warping Module (PWM) and Stitched Image Generating Module (SIGMo). PWM employs an optical flow estimation model to obtain pixel-wise warp of the whole image, and relocates the pixels of the target image with the obtained warp field. SIGMo blends the warped target image and the reference image while eliminating unwanted artifacts such as misalignments, seams, and holes that harm the plausibility of the stitched result. For training and evaluating the proposed framework, we build a large-scale dataset that includes image pairs with corresponding pixel-wise ground truth warp and sample stitched result images. We show that the results of the proposed framework are qualitatively superior to those of the conventional methods, especially when the images have large parallax. The code and the proposed dataset will be publicly available soon.</p></details> |  | None |

Both handcrafted-based and recently emerged deep learning-based keypoints matching methods merely rely on keypoints and local features, while losing sight of other available sensors such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) in the above applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that the motion estimation from IMU integration can be used to exploit the spatial distribution prior of keypoints between images. To this end, a probabilistic perspective of attention formulation is proposed to integrate the spatial distribution prior into the attentional graph neural network naturally. With the assistance of spatial distribution prior, the effort of the network for modeling the hidden features can be reduced. Furthermore, we present a projection loss for the proposed keypoints matching network, which gives a smooth edge between matching and un-matching keypoints. Image matching experiments on visual SLAM datasets indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented method.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional homography estimation methods heavily depend on the quantity and distribution of feature correspondences, leading to poor robustness in low-texture scenes. The learning solutions, on the contrary, try to learn robust deep features but demonstrate unsatisfying performance in the scenes with low overlap rates. In this paper, we address these two problems simultaneously by designing a contextual correlation layer (CCL). The CCL can efficiently capture the long-range correlation within feature maps and can be flexibly used in a learning framework. In addition, considering that a single homography can not represent the complex spatial transformation in depth-varying images with parallax, we propose to predict multi-grid homography from global to local. Moreover, we equip our network with a depth perception capability, by introducing a novel depth-aware shape-preserved loss.

It has been observed that current deepfake generation methods leave discriminative artifacts in the frequency spectrum of fake images and videos. Inspired by this observation, in this paper, we present a novel approach, termed as MD-CSDNetwork, for combining the features in the spatial and frequency domains to mine a shared discriminative representation for classifying \textit{deepfakes}. MD-CSDNetwork is a novel cross-stitched network with two parallel branches carrying the spatial and frequency information, respectively. We hypothesize that these multi-domain input data streams can be considered as related supervisory signals. The supervision from both branches ensures better performance and generalization. Further, the concept of cross-stitch connections is utilized where they are inserted between the two branches to learn an optimal combination of domain-specific and shared representations from other domains automatically. Extensive experiments are conducted on the popular benchmark dataset namely FaceForeniscs++ for forgery classification. We report improvements over all the manipulation types in FaceForensics++ dataset and comparable results with state-of-the-art methods for cross-database evaluation on the Celeb-DF dataset and the Deepfake Detection Dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

| **[How Shift Equivariance Impacts Metric Learning for Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05846v3)** | 2021-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metric learning has received conflicting assessments concerning its suitability for solving instance segmentation tasks. It has been dismissed as theoretically flawed due to the shift equivariance of the employed CNNs and their respective inability to distinguish same-looking objects. Yet it has been shown to yield state of the art results for a variety of tasks, and practical issues have mainly been reported in the context of tile-and-stitch approaches, where discontinuities at tile boundaries have been observed. To date, neither of the reported issues have undergone thorough formal analysis. In our work, we contribute a comprehensive formal analysis of the shift equivariance properties of encoder-decoder-style CNNs, which yields a clear picture of what can and cannot be achieved with metric learning in the face of same-looking objects. In particular, we prove that a standard encoder-decoder network that takes $d$-dimensional images as input, with $l$ pooling layers and pooling factor $f$, has the capacity to distinguish at most $f^{dl}$ same-looking objects, and we show that this upper limit can be reached. Furthermore, we show that to avoid discontinuities in a tile-and-stitch approach, assuming standard batch size 1, it is necessary to employ valid convolutions in combination with a training output window size strictly greater than $f^l$, while at test-time it is necessary to crop tiles to size $n\cdot f^l$ before stitching, with $n\geq 1$. We complement these theoretical findings by discussing a number of insightful special cases for which we show empirical results on synthetic data.</p></details> |  | None |

To defend against adversarial attacks in a training-free and attack-agnostic manner, this work proposes a novel and effective reconstruction-based defense framework by delving into deep image prior (DIP). Fundamentally different from existing reconstruction-based defenses, the proposed method analyzes and explicitly incorporates the model decision process into our defense. Given an adversarial image, firstly we map its reconstructed images during DIP optimization to the model decision space, where cross-boundary images can be detected and on-boundary images can be further localized. Then, adversarial noise is purified by perturbing on-boundary images along the reverse direction to the adversarial image. Finally, on-manifold images are stitched to construct an image that can be correctly predicted by the victim classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods both in defending white-box attacks and defense-aware attacks. Moreover, the proposed method can maintain a high visual quality during adversarial image reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be publish in ACM MM 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[A Robust Method for Image Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03860v3)** | 2021-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for large-scale image stitching that is robust against repetitive patterns and featureless regions in the imagery. In such cases, state-of-the-art image stitching methods easily produce image alignment artifacts, since they may produce false pairwise image registrations that are in conflict within the global connectivity graph. Our method augments the current methods by collecting all the plausible pairwise image registration candidates, among which globally consistent candidates are chosen. This enables the stitching process to determine the correct pairwise registrations by utilizing all the available information from the whole imagery, such as unambiguous registrations outside the repeating pattern and featureless regions. We formalize the method as a weighted multigraph whose nodes represent the individual image transformations from the composite image, and whose sets of multiple edges between two nodes represent all the plausible transformations between the pixel coordinates of the two images. The edge weights represent the plausibility of the transformations. The image transformations and the edge weights are solved from a non-linear minimization problem with linear constraints, for which a projection method is used. As an example, we apply the method in a large-scale scanning application where the transformations are primarily translations with only slight rotation and scaling component. Despite these simplifications, the state-of-the-art methods do not produce adequate results in such applications, since the image overlap is small, which can be featureless or repetitive, and misalignment artifacts and their concealment are unacceptable.</p></details> |  | None |

The learning-based image stitching solutions are rarely studied due to the lack of labeled data, making the supervised methods unreliable. To address the above limitations, we propose an unsupervised deep image stitching framework consisting of two stages: unsupervised coarse image alignment and unsupervised image reconstruction. In the first stage, we design an ablation-based loss to constrain an unsupervised homography network, which is more suitable for large-baseline scenes. Moreover, a transformer layer is introduced to warp the input images in the stitching-domain space. In the second stage, motivated by the insight that the misalignments in pixel-level can be eliminated to a certain extent in feature-level, we design an unsupervised image reconstruction network to eliminate the artifacts from features to pixels. Specifically, the reconstruction network can be implemented by a low-resolution deformation branch and a high-resolution refined branch, learning the deformation rules of image stitching and enhancing the resolution simultaneously. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, a comprehensive real-world image dataset for unsupervised deep image stitching is presented and released. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art solutions. Even compared with the supervised solutions, our image stitching quality is still preferred by users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> | None |
| **[Mesoscopic photogrammetry with an unstabilized phone camera](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06044v1)** | 2021-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a feature-free photogrammetric technique that enables quantitative 3D mesoscopic (mm-scale height variation) imaging with tens-of-micron accuracy from sequences of images acquired by a smartphone at close range (several cm) under freehand motion without additional hardware. Our end-to-end, pixel-intensity-based approach jointly registers and stitches all the images by estimating a coaligned height map, which acts as a pixel-wise radial deformation field that orthorectifies each camera image to allow homographic registration. The height maps themselves are reparameterized as the output of an untrained encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) with the raw camera images as the input, which effectively removes many reconstruction artifacts. Our method also jointly estimates both the camera's dynamic 6D pose and its distortion using a nonparametric model, the latter of which is especially important in mesoscopic applications when using cameras not designed for imaging at short working distances, such as smartphone cameras. We also propose strategies for reducing computation time and memory, applicable to other multi-frame registration problems. Finally, we demonstrate our method using sequences of multi-megapixel images captured by an unstabilized smartphone on a variety of samples (e.g., painting brushstrokes, circuit board, seeds).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Stitching Algorithm for Automated Surface Inspection of Rotationally Symmetric Components](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00308v3)** | 2021-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a novel approach to stitching surface images of rotationally symmetric parts. It presents a process pipeline that uses a feature-based stitching approach to create a distortion-free and true-to-life image from a video file. The developed process thus enables, for example, condition monitoring without having to view many individual images. For validation purposes, this will be demonstrated in the paper using the concrete example of a worn ball screw drive spindle. The developed algorithm aims at reproducing the functional principle of a line scan camera system, whereby the physical measuring systems are replaced by a feature-based approach. For evaluation of the stitching algorithms, metrics are used, some of which have only been developed in this work or have been supplemented by test procedures already in use. The applicability of the developed algorithm is not only limited to machine tool spindles. Instead, the developed method allows a general approach to the surface inspection of various rotationally symmetric components and can therefore be used in a variety of industrial applications. Deep-learning-based detection Algorithms can easily be implemented to generate a complete pipeline for failure detection and condition monitoring on rotationally symmetric parts.</p></details> | 9 pages, 13 figures | None |
| **[SAFRON: Stitching Across the Frontier for Generating Colorectal Cancer Histology Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04526v2)** | 2021-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic images can be used for the development and evaluation of deep learning algorithms in the context of limited availability of data. In the field of computational pathology, where histology images are large in size and visual context is crucial, synthesis of large high resolution images via generative modeling is a challenging task. This is due to memory and computational constraints hindering the generation of large images. To address this challenge, we propose a novel SAFRON (Stitching Across the FRONtiers) framework to construct realistic, large high resolution tissue image tiles from ground truth annotations while preserving morphological features and with minimal boundary artifacts. We show that the proposed method can generate realistic image tiles of arbitrarily large size after training it on relatively small image patches. We demonstrate that our model can generate high quality images, both visually and in terms of the Frechet Inception Distance. Compared to other existing approaches, our framework is efficient in terms of the memory requirements for training and also in terms of the number of computations to construct a large high-resolution image. We also show that training on synthetic data generated by SAFRON can significantly boost the performance of a state-of-the-art algorithm for gland segmentation in colorectal cancer histology images. Sample high resolution images generated using SAFRON are available at the URL: https://warwick.ac.uk/TIALab/SAFRON</p></details> |  | None |
| **[High-Resolution Deep Image Matting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06613v2)** | 2021-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image matting is a key technique for image and video editing and composition. Conventionally, deep learning approaches take the whole input image and an associated trimap to infer the alpha matte using convolutional neural networks. Such approaches set state-of-the-arts in image matting; however, they may fail in real-world matting applications due to hardware limitations, since real-world input images for matting are mostly of very high resolution. In this paper, we propose HDMatt, a first deep learning based image matting approach for high-resolution inputs. More concretely, HDMatt runs matting in a patch-based crop-and-stitch manner for high-resolution inputs with a novel module design to address the contextual dependency and consistency issues between different patches. Compared with vanilla patch-based inference which computes each patch independently, we explicitly model the cross-patch contextual dependency with a newly-proposed Cross-Patch Contextual module (CPC) guided by the given trimap. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its necessity for high-resolution inputs. Our HDMatt approach also sets new state-of-the-art performance on Adobe Image Matting and AlphaMatting benchmarks and produce impressive visual results on more real-world high-resolution images.</p></details> | AAAI 2021 | None |
| **[Learning Edge-Preserved Image Stitching from Large-Baseline Deep Homography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06194v1)** | 2020-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching is a classical and crucial technique in computer vision, which aims to generate the image with a wide field of view. The traditional methods heavily depend on the feature detection and require that scene features be dense and evenly distributed in the image, leading to varying ghosting effects and poor robustness. Learning methods usually suffer from fixed view and input size limitations, showing a lack of generalization ability on other real datasets. In this paper, we propose an image stitching learning framework, which consists of a large-baseline deep homography module and an edge-preserved deformation module. First, we propose a large-baseline deep homography module to estimate the accurate projective transformation between the reference image and the target image in different scales of features. After that, an edge-preserved deformation module is designed to learn the deformation rules of image stitching from edge to content, eliminating the ghosting effects as much as possible. In particular, the proposed learning framework can stitch images of arbitrary views and input sizes, thus contribute to a supervised deep image stitching method with excellent generalization capability in other real images. Experimental results demonstrate that our homography module significantly outperforms the existing deep homography methods in the large baseline scenes. In image stitching, our method is superior to the existing learning method and shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art traditional methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures | None |
| **[Minimal Solutions for Panoramic Stitching Given Gravity Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00465v1)** | 2020-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When capturing panoramas, people tend to align their cameras with the vertical axis, i.e., the direction of gravity. Moreover, modern devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are equipped with an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) that can measure the gravity vector accurately. Using this prior, the y-axes of the cameras can be aligned or assumed to be already aligned, reducing their relative orientation to 1-DOF (degree of freedom). Exploiting this assumption, we propose new minimal solutions to panoramic image stitching of images taken by cameras with coinciding optical centers, i.e., undergoing pure rotation. We consider four practical camera configurations, assuming unknown fixed or varying focal length with or without radial distortion. The solvers are tested both on synthetic scenes and on more than 500k real image pairs from the Sun360 dataset and from scenes captured by us using two smartphones equipped with IMUs. It is shown, that they outperform the state-of-the-art both in terms of accuracy and processing time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Object-centered image stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11789v1)** | 2020-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching is typically decomposed into three phases: registration, which aligns the source images with a common target image; seam finding, which determines for each target pixel the source image it should come from; and blending, which smooths transitions over the seams. As described in [1], the seam finding phase attempts to place seams between pixels where the transition between source images is not noticeable. Here, we observe that the most problematic failures of this approach occur when objects are cropped, omitted, or duplicated. We therefore take an object-centered approach to the problem, leveraging recent advances in object detection [2,3,4]. We penalize candidate solutions with this class of error by modifying the energy function used in the seam finding stage. This produces substantially more realistic stitching results on challenging imagery. In addition, these methods can be used to determine when there is non-recoverable occlusion in the input data, and also suggest a simple evaluation metric that can be used to evaluate the output of stitching algorithms.</p></details> | ECCV 2018 | None |
| **[Robust image stitching with multiple registrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11784v1)** | 2020-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panorama creation is one of the most widely deployed techniques in computer vision. In addition to industry applications such as Google Street View, it is also used by millions of consumers in smartphones and other cameras. Traditionally, the problem is decomposed into three phases: registration, which picks a single transformation of each source image to align it to the other inputs, seam finding, which selects a source image for each pixel in the final result, and blending, which fixes minor visual artifacts. Here, we observe that the use of a single registration often leads to errors, especially in scenes with significant depth variation or object motion. We propose instead the use of multiple registrations, permitting regions of the image at different depths to be captured with greater accuracy. MRF inference techniques naturally extend to seam finding over multiple registrations, and we show here that their energy functions can be readily modified with new terms that discourage duplication and tearing, common problems that are exacerbated by the use of multiple registrations. Our techniques are closely related to layer-based stereo, and move image stitching closer to explicit scene modeling. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our techniques often generate significantly better panoramas when there is substantial motion or parallax.</p></details> | ECCV 2018 | None |
| **[More Informed Random Sample Consensus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09116v1)** | 2020-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random sample consensus (RANSAC) is a robust model-fitting algorithm. It is widely used in many fields including image-stitching and point cloud registration. In RANSAC, data is uniformly sampled for hypothesis generation. However, this uniform sampling strategy does not fully utilize all the information on many problems. In this paper, we propose a method that samples data with a L\'{e}vy distribution together with a data sorting algorithm. In the hypothesis sampling step of the proposed method, data is sorted with a sorting algorithm we proposed, which sorts data based on the likelihood of a data point being in the inlier set. Then, hypotheses are sampled from the sorted data with L\'{e}vy distribution. The proposed method is evaluated on both simulation and real-world public datasets. Our method shows better results compared with the uniform baseline method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, slide digitization is bottlenecked by the high cost of precise motor stages in slide scanners that are needed for position information used for slide stitching. We propose GloFlow, a two-stage method for creating a whole slide image using optical flow-based image registration with global alignment using a computationally tractable graph-pruning approach. In the first stage, we train an optical flow predictor to predict pairwise translations between successive video frames to approximate a stitch. In the second stage, this approximate stitch is used to create a neighborhood graph to produce a corrected stitch. On a simulated dataset of video scans of WSIs, we find that our method outperforms known approaches to slide-stitching, and stitches WSIs resembling those produced by slide scanners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) at NeurIPS 2020 - Extended Abstract</p></details> | None |
| **[A Method of Generating Measurable Panoramic Image for Indoor Mobile Measurement System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14270v1)** | 2020-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper designs a technique route to generate high-quality panoramic image with depth information, which involves two critical research hotspots: fusion of LiDAR and image data and image stitching. For the fusion of 3D points and image data, since a sparse depth map can be firstly generated by projecting LiDAR point onto the RGB image plane based on our reliable calibrated and synchronized sensors, we adopt a parameter self-adaptive framework to produce 2D dense depth map. For image stitching, optimal seamline for the overlapping area is searched using a graph-cuts-based method to alleviate the geometric influence and image blending based on the pyramid multi-band is utilized to eliminate the photometric effects near the stitching line. Since each pixel is associated with a depth value, we design this depth value as a radius in the spherical projection which can further project the panoramic image to the world coordinate and consequently produces a high-quality measurable panoramic image. The purposed method is tested on the data from our data collection platform and presents a satisfactory application prospects.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[High-quality Panorama Stitching based on Asymmetric Bidirectional Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01201v3)** | 2020-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a panorama stitching algorithm based on asymmetric bidirectional optical flow. This algorithm expects multiple photos captured by fisheye lens cameras as input, and then, through the proposed algorithm, these photos can be merged into a high-quality 360-degree spherical panoramic image. For photos taken from a distant perspective, the parallax among them is relatively small, and the obtained panoramic image can be nearly seamless and undistorted. For photos taken from a close perspective or with a relatively large parallax, a seamless though partially distorted panoramic image can also be obtained. Besides, with the help of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), this algorithm can complete the whole stitching process at a very fast speed: typically, it only takes less than 30s to obtain a panoramic image of 9000-by-4000 pixels, which means our panorama stitching algorithm is of high value in many real-time applications.

Despite the high complexity of RS geometry, we focus in this paper on a special yet common input -- two consecutive frames from a video stream, wherein the inter-frame motion is restricted from being arbitrarily large. This allows us to adopt simpler differential motion model, leading to a straightforward and practical minimal solver. To deal with non-planar scene and camera parallax in stitching, we further propose an RS-aware spatially-varying homography field in the principle of As-Projective-As-Possible (APAP). We show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods both in RS image stitching and rectification, especially for images captured by hand-held shaking cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2020.
