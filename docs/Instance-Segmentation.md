Given an image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The code will be released here.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 14 tables, Neurips 2025</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we present ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest, simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks, including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems(NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

| **[One-Timestep is Enough: Achieving High-performance ANN-to-SNN Conversion via Scale-and-Fire Neurons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23383v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining attention as energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), especially in resource-constrained settings. While ANN-to-SNN conversion (ANN2SNN) achieves high accuracy without end-to-end SNN training, existing methods rely on large time steps, leading to high inference latency and computational cost. In this paper, we propose a theoretical and practical framework for single-timestep ANN2SNN. We establish the Temporal-to-Spatial Equivalence Theory, proving that multi-timestep integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons can be equivalently replaced by single-timestep multi-threshold neurons (MTN). Based on this theory, we introduce the Scale-and-Fire Neuron (SFN), which enables effective single-timestep ($T=1$) spiking through adaptive scaling and firing. Furthermore, we develop the SFN-based Spiking Transformer (SFormer), a specialized instantiation of SFN within Transformer architectures, where spike patterns are aligned with attention distributions to mitigate the computational, energy, and hardware overhead of the multi-threshold design. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under single-timestep inference. Notably, we achieve 88.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K at $T=1$, surpassing existing conversion methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Long-Tailed Classification by Keeping the Good and Removing the Bad Momentum Causal Effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12991v5)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the class size grows, maintaining a balanced dataset across many classes is challenging because the data are long-tailed in nature; it is even impossible when the sample-of-interest co-exists with each other in one collectable unit, e.g., multiple visual instances in one image. Therefore, long-tailed classification is the key to deep learning at scale. However, existing methods are mainly based on re-weighting/re-sampling heuristics that lack a fundamental theory. In this paper, we establish a causal inference framework, which not only unravels the whys of previous methods, but also derives a new principled solution. Specifically, our theory shows that the SGD momentum is essentially a confounder in long-tailed classification. On one hand, it has a harmful causal effect that misleads the tail prediction biased towards the head. On the other hand, its induced mediation also benefits the representation learning and head prediction. Our framework elegantly disentangles the paradoxical effects of the momentum, by pursuing the direct causal effect caused by an input sample. In particular, we use causal intervention in training, and counterfactual reasoning in inference, to remove the "bad" while keep the "good". We achieve new state-of-the-arts on three long-tailed visual recognition benchmarks: Long-tailed CIFAR-10/-100, ImageNet-LT for image classification and LVIS for instance segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2020.

| **[Urban 3D Change Detection Using LiDAR Sensor for HD Map Maintenance and Smart Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21112v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins, and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height, and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes. Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes, and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement, and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Circle Representation for Medical Instance Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11507v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, circle representation has been introduced for medical imaging, designed specifically to enhance the detection of instance objects that are spherically shaped (e.g., cells, glomeruli, and nuclei). Given its outstanding effectiveness in instance detection, it is compelling to consider the application of circle representation for segmenting instance medical objects. In this study, we introduce CircleSnake, a simple end-to-end segmentation approach that utilizes circle contour deformation for segmenting ball-shaped medical objects at the instance level. The innovation of CircleSnake lies in these three areas: (1) It substitutes the complex bounding box-to-octagon contour transformation with a more consistent and rotation-invariant bounding circle-to-circle contour adaptation. This adaptation specifically targets ball-shaped medical objects. (2) The circle representation employed in CircleSnake significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to two, compared to eight in the octagon representation. This reduction enhances both the robustness of the segmentation performance and the rotational consistency of the method. (3) CircleSnake is the first end-to-end deep instance segmentation pipeline to incorporate circle representation, encompassing consistent circle detection, circle contour proposal, and circular convolution in a unified framework. This integration is achieved through the novel application of circular graph convolution within the context of circle detection and instance segmentation. In practical applications, such as the detection of glomeruli, nuclei, and eosinophils in pathological images, CircleSnake has demonstrated superior performance and greater rotation invariance when compared to benchmarks. The code has been made publicly available: https://github.com/hrlblab/CircleSnake.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/hrlblab/CircleSnake) |

Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF), aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%, 17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the second-best results on structurally complex species. More importantly, PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance segmentation tasks. Across all plant species, it achieved average improvements of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively. This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of large-scale models in plant science.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Automated Morphological Analysis of Neurons in Fluorescence Microscopy Using YOLOv8](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19455v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation and precise morphological analysis of neuronal cells in fluorescence microscopy images are crucial steps in neuroscience and biomedical imaging applications. However, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring significant manual effort and expertise to ensure reliable outcomes. This work presents a pipeline for neuron instance segmentation and measurement based on a high-resolution dataset of stem-cell-derived neurons. The proposed method uses YOLOv8, trained on manually annotated microscopy images. The model achieved high segmentation accuracy, exceeding 97%. In addition, the pipeline utilized both ground truth and predicted masks to extract biologically significant features, including cell length, width, area, and grayscale intensity values. The overall accuracy of the extracted morphological measurements reached 75.32%, further supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This integrated framework offers a valuable tool for automated analysis in cell imaging and neuroscience research, reducing the need for manual annotation and enabling scalable, precise quantification of neuron morphology.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures and 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[gen2seg: Generative Models Enable Generalizable Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15263v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs, generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE (encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on our website.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://reachomk.github.io/gen2seg/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://reachomk.github.io/gen2seg) |
| **[Intelligent Software System for Low-Cost, Brightfield Segmentation: Algorithmic Implementation for Cytometric Auto-Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11354v4)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bright-field microscopy, a cost-effective solution for live-cell culture, is often the only resource available, along with standard CPUs, for many low-budget labs. The inherent chal- lenges of bright-field images - their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology - coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis frame- work designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular archi- tecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications - particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the degraded underwater environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring, camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module (CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning, effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands, improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16538v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in visual understanding but often lack reliable grounding capabilities and actionable inference rates. Integrating them with open-vocabulary object detection (OVD), instance segmentation, and tracking leverages their strengths while mitigating these drawbacks. We utilize VLM-generated structured descriptions to identify visible object instances, collect application-relevant attributes, and inform an open-vocabulary detector to extract corresponding bounding boxes that are passed to a video segmentation model providing segmentation masks and tracking. Once initialized, this model directly extracts segmentation masks, processing image streams in real time with minimal computational overhead. Tracks can be updated online as needed by generating new structured descriptions and detections. This combines the descriptive power of VLMs with the grounding capability of OVD and the pixel-level understanding and speed of video segmentation. Our evaluation across datasets and robotics platforms demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, showcasing its ability to extract task-specific attributes from non-standard objects in dynamic environments.

Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR. The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out center. The dataset and annotations are available in Google Form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmyMAPSTGrIy2sTnz0-TMw08ZagTimRulbAQcWdaPwDy187A/viewform?usp=dialog).</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 11 tables.

| **[MARIS: Marine Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation with Geometric Enhancement and Semantic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15398v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS} (\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance \underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components. The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM}) enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future underwater perception research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data and thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial for MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.41%), video object segmentation (29.83%), object detection (46.22%), and multiple object tracking (44.94%).

However, their high computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy. Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |
| **[TRACE: Your Diffusion Model is Secretly an Instance Edge Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07982v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality instance and panoptic segmentation has traditionally relied on dense instance-level annotations such as masks, boxes, or points, which are costly, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Unsupervised and weakly-supervised approaches reduce this burden but remain constrained by semantic backbone constraints and human bias, often producing merged or fragmented outputs. We present TRACE (TRAnsforming diffusion Cues to instance Edges), showing that text-to-image diffusion models secretly function as instance edge annotators. TRACE identifies the Instance Emergence Point (IEP) where object boundaries first appear in self-attention maps, extracts boundaries through Attention Boundary Divergence (ABDiv), and distills them into a lightweight one-step edge decoder. This design removes the need for per-image diffusion inversion, achieving 81x faster inference while producing sharper and more connected boundaries. On the COCO benchmark, TRACE improves unsupervised instance segmentation by +5.1 AP, and in tag-supervised panoptic segmentation it outperforms point-supervised baselines by +1.7 PQ without using any instance-level labels. These results reveal that diffusion models encode hidden instance boundary priors, and that decoding these signals offers a practical and scalable alternative to costly manual annotation.

Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks.

| **[Enhancing Representations through Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05108v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating heterogeneous representations from different architectures has facilitated various vision tasks, e.g., some hybrid networks combine transformers and convolutions. However, complementarity between such heterogeneous architectures has not been well exploited in self-supervised learning. Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which enforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is heterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model with new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural changes. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on various heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We discover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their architecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a search strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a specific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to enlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various self-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

To mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage. However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining computationally efficient.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Cell Instance Segmentation: The Devil Is in the Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09848v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity, which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge, we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries), to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions On Medical Imaging (TMI)</p></details> | None |

Conditions such as heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images. Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP) of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP of only 35.69%.

However, the high cost and scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods, while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully supervised methods in some scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity. We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K) on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4 $N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in visual grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/weikaih04/SOS</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/weikaih04/SOS) |

Existing methods typically map 3D instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from 2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled 3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than previous methods.

We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework that compresses pre-trained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM(s) via self-training with contrastive calibration, (2) knowledge transfer through a unified multi-objective loss, and (3) student refinement to mitigate residual pseudo-label bias. Central to CAST is an \emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask and class scores to extract informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11x smaller student improves over its zero-shot VFM teacher(s) by +8.5 and +7.1 AP, surpasses adapted teacher(s) by +3.4 and +1.5 AP, and further outperforms state-of-the-art SSKD methods on both benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Patent documents, in particular, contain molecular information in visual form, which is often inaccessible through traditional text-based searches. In this work, we introduce SubGrapher, a method for the visual fingerprinting of chemical structure images. Unlike conventional Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) models that attempt to reconstruct full molecular graphs, SubGrapher focuses on extracting molecular fingerprints directly from chemical structure images. Using learning-based instance segmentation, SubGrapher identifies functional groups and carbon backbones, constructing a substructure-based fingerprint that enables chemical structure retrieval. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art OCSR and fingerprinting methods, demonstrating superior retrieval performance and robustness across diverse molecular depictions.

The system replaces active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale, marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Overlap-aware segmentation for topological reconstruction of obscured objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06194v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The separation of overlapping objects presents a significant challenge in scientific imaging. While deep learning segmentation-regression algorithms can predict pixel-wise intensities, they typically treat all regions equally rather than prioritizing overlap regions where attribution is most ambiguous. Recent advances in instance segmentation show that weighting regions of pixel overlap in training can improve segmentation boundary predictions in regions of overlap, but this idea has not yet been extended to segmentation regression. We address this with Overlap-Aware Segmentation of ImageS (OASIS): a new segmentation-regression framework with a weighted loss function designed to prioritize regions of object-overlap during training, enabling extraction of pixel intensities and topological features from heavily obscured objects. We demonstrate OASIS in the context of the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to directly image the Migdal effect--a rare process where electron emission is induced by nuclear scattering--in a low-pressure optical time projection chamber. This setting poses an extreme test case, as the target for reconstruction is a faint electron recoil track which is often heavily-buried within the orders-of-magnitude brighter nuclear recoil track. Compared to unweighted training, OASIS improves median intensity reconstruction errors from -32% to -14% for low-energy electron tracks (4-5 keV) and improves topological intersection-over-union scores from 0.828 to 0.855. These performance gains demonstrate OASIS's ability to recover obscured signals in overlap-dominated regions. The framework provides a generalizable methodology for scientific imaging where pixels represent physical quantities and overlap obscures features of interest. All code is openly available to facilitate cross-domain adoption.</p></details> |  | None |

Nearly all U.S. cotton is grown in the Cotton Belt, spanning 17 states in the southern region. Harvesting remains a critical yet challenging stage, impacted by the use of costly, environmentally harmful defoliants and heavy, expensive cotton pickers. These factors contribute to yield loss, reduced fiber quality, and soil compaction, which collectively threaten long-term sustainability. To address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight, small-scale, vision-guided autonomous robotic cotton picker as an alternative. An autonomous system, built on Clearpath's Husky platform and integrated with the CottonEye perception system, was developed and tested in the Gazebo simulation environment. A virtual cotton field was designed to facilitate autonomous navigation testing. The navigation system used Global Positioning System (GPS) and map-based guidance, assisted by an RGBdepth camera and a YOLOv8nseg instance segmentation model. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.2%, a recall of 88.9%, and a precision of 93.0%. The GPS-based approach reached a 100% completion rate (CR) within a $(5e-6)^{\circ}$ threshold, while the map-based method achieved a 96.7% CR within a 0.25 m threshold. The developed Robot Operating System (ROS) packages enable robust simulation of autonomous cotton picking, offering a scalable baseline for future agricultural robotics.

Current methods attempt to reduce this burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth (GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes.

We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180 degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets.

To overcome this limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts. Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones, including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are constrained. The code will be publicly released.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a heuristic post-processing module that aligns predicted keypoints to tooth boundaries using an auxiliary instance segmentation model. An evaluation metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), is proposed to capture keypoint performance in dental imaging domains. Four donor pose estimation models were adapted with fine-tuning for our keypoint problem. Post-processing improved fine-grained localisation, raising average PRCK^{0.05} by +0.028, but reduced coarse performance for PRCK^{0.25} by -0.0523 and PRCK^{0.5} by -0.0345. Orientation estimation shows excellent performance for auxiliary segmentation when filtered with either stage 1 object detection model. Periodontal staging was detected sufficiently, with the best mesial and distal Dice scores of 0.508 and 0.489, while furcation involvement and widened periodontal ligament space tasks remained challenging due to scarce positive samples. Scalability is implied with similar validation and external set performance. The annotation methodology enables stage agnostic training with balanced representation across disease severities for some detection tasks. The PRCK metric provides a domain-specific alternative to generic pose metrics, while the heuristic post-processing module consistently corrected implausible predictions with occasional catastrophic failures. The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of clinically interpretable periodontal bone loss assessment, with potential to reduce diagnostic variability and clinician workload.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 tables, 9 figures, 1 equation, journal paper submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> | None |

At the core of their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of global dependencies among input tokens.

To address this, we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing, highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

This study compares the one stage YOLOv8 model with the two stage Mask R CNN model for instance segmentation under varying orchard conditions across two datasets. Dataset 1, collected in the dormant season, contains images of apple trees without foliage and was used to train multi object segmentation models delineating branches and trunks. Dataset 2, collected in the early growing season, includes canopy images with green foliage and immature apples and was used to train single object segmentation models delineating fruitlets. Results showed YOLOv8 outperformed Mask R CNN with higher precision and near perfect recall at a confidence threshold of 0.5. For Dataset 1, YOLOv8 achieved precision 0.90 and recall 0.95 compared to 0.81 and 0.81 for Mask R CNN. For Dataset 2, YOLOv8 reached precision 0.93 and recall 0.97 compared to 0.85 and 0.88. Inference times were also lower for YOLOv8, at 10.9 ms and 7.8 ms, versus 15.6 ms and 12.8 ms for Mask R CNN.

However, effectively integrating fine-grained perception tasks like detection and segmentation into these models remains a significant challenge. This is primarily because these tasks often rely heavily on task-specific designs and architectures that can complicate the modeling process. To address this challenge, we present \ours, a framework that \textbf{U}nifies \textbf{F}ine-grained visual perception tasks through an \textbf{O}pen-ended language interface. By transforming all perception targets into the language space, \ours unifies object-level detection, pixel-level segmentation, and image-level vision-language tasks into a single model. Additionally, we introduce a novel embedding retrieval approach that relies solely on the language interface to support segmentation tasks. Our framework bridges the gap between fine-grained perception and vision-language tasks, significantly simplifying architectural design and training strategies while achieving comparable or superior performance to methods with intricate task-specific designs. After multi-task training on five standard visual perception datasets, \ours outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generalist models by 12.3 mAP on COCO instance segmentation and 3.3 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation. Furthermore, our method seamlessly integrates with existing MLLMs, effectively combining fine-grained perception capabilities with their advanced language abilities, thereby enabling more challenging tasks such as reasoning segmentation.

This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only 4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31% improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10 to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

The paper sequentially details architectural innovations of YOLO26, including the removal of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), adoption of end-to-end NMS-free inference, integration of ProgLoss and Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stable convergence. Beyond architecture, the study positions YOLO26 as a multi-task framework, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, pose/keypoints estimation, oriented detection, and classification. We present performance benchmarks of YOLO26 on edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Orin, comparing its results with YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12, YOLOv13, and transformer-based detectors(RF-DETR and RT-DETR). This paper further explores real-time deployment pathways, flexible export options (ONNX, TensorRT, CoreML, TFLite), and quantization for INT8/FP16. Practical use cases of YOLO26 across robotics, manufacturing, and IoT are highlighted to demonstrate cross-industry adaptability. Finally, insights on deployment efficiency and broader implications are discussed, with future directions for YOLO26 and the YOLO lineage outlined.</p></details> |  | None |

An essential part of the ViG framework is the node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to prior vision GNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV submission. 13 pages, including the main text (8 pages), references, and supplementary material</p></details> | None |
| **[Accelerating Dynamic Image Graph Construction on FPGA for Vision GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25121v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Graph Neural Networks (Vision GNNs, or ViGs) represent images as unstructured graphs, achieving state of the art performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. Dynamic Image Graph Construction (DIGC) builds image graphs by connecting patches (nodes) based on feature similarity, and is dynamically repeated in each ViG layer following GNN based patch (node) feature updates. However, DIGC constitutes over 50% of end to end ViG inference latency, rising to 95% at high image resolutions, making it the dominant computational bottleneck. While hardware acceleration holds promise, prior works primarily optimize graph construction algorithmically, often compromising DIGC flexibility, accuracy, or generality. To address these limitations, we propose a streaming, deeply pipelined FPGA accelerator for DIGC, featuring on chip buffers that process input features in small, uniform blocks. Our design minimizes external memory traffic via localized computation and performs efficient parallel sorting with local merge sort and global k way merging directly on streaming input blocks via heap insertion. This modular architecture scales seamlessly across image resolutions, ViG layer types, and model sizes and variants, and supports DIGC across diverse ViG based vision backbones. The design achieves high clock frequencies post place and route due to the statically configured parallelism minimizing critical path delay and delivers up to 16.6x and 6.8x speedups over optimized CPU and GPU DIGC baselines.</p></details> | IEEE HPEC 2025 | None |
| **[RAM-W1K: A Multi-Task Wrist Dataset and Benchmark for Rheumatoid Arthritis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05193v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis, which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii) Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 1048 wrist conventional radiographs of 388 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level instance segmentation annotations for 618 images and SvdH BE scores for 800 images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within the RA-related domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[OVSeg3R: Learn Open-vocabulary Instance Segmentation from 2D via 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23541v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm, which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision, stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of +2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised Online 3D Instance Segmentation with Synthetic Sequences and Dynamic Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23194v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations. In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | [Code Link](github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D) |
| **[CoT-RVS: Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Segmentation for Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18561v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning Video Object Segmentation is a challenging task, aiming at generating a mask sequence from an input video given a complex and implicit text query. While existing works finetune Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for the task, they still fail in video inputs given complex temporally-sensitive queries, indicating their lack of temporal and spatial integration in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose CoT-RVS, a novel framework employing the zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these complex challenges by temporal-semantic reasoning: CoT-RVS analyzes the visible objects within a given frame that possibly match the language query (semantic), and chooses a corresponding keyframe for each object that can be observed effortlessly among all frames (temporal). Notably, the CoT-RVS framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs, which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. Our framework's training-free feature further allows its extension to process online video streams, where the CoT is used at test time to update the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with explicit and implicit queries. The results show that CoT-RVS significantly outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning What To Hear: Boosting Sound-Source Association For Robust Audiovisual Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22740v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audiovisual instance segmentation (AVIS) requires accurately localizing and tracking sounding objects throughout video sequences. Existing methods suffer from visual bias stemming from two fundamental issues: uniform additive fusion prevents queries from specializing to different sound sources, while visual-only training objectives allow queries to converge to arbitrary salient objects. We propose Audio-Centric Query Generation using cross-attention, enabling each query to selectively attend to distinct sound sources and carry sound-specific priors into visual decoding. Additionally, we introduce Sound-Aware Ordinal Counting (SAOC) loss that explicitly supervises sounding object numbers through ordinal regression with monotonic consistency constraints, preventing visual-only convergence during training. Experiments on AVISeg benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements: +1.64 mAP, +0.6 HOTA, and +2.06 FSLA, validating that query specialization and explicit counting supervision are crucial for accurate audiovisual instance segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci- dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025).

As 3D training data is generally not as sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation. SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for 3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its superiority.</p></details> |  | None |

Stalk diameter is a key structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation, 3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and agronomic research.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalized medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Multi-View Weak Supervision for Occlusion-Aware Multi-Human Parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10093v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-human parsing is the task of segmenting human body parts while associating each part to the person it belongs to, combining instance-level and part-level information for fine-grained human understanding. In this work, we demonstrate that, while state-of-the-art approaches achieved notable results on public datasets, they struggle considerably in segmenting people with overlapping bodies. From the intuition that overlapping people may appear separated from a different point of view, we propose a novel training framework exploiting multi-view information to improve multi-human parsing models under occlusions. Our method integrates such knowledge during the training process, introducing a novel approach based on weak supervision on human instances and a multi-view consistency loss. Given the lack of suitable datasets in the literature, we propose a semi-automatic annotation strategy to generate human instance segmentation masks from multi-view RGB+D data and 3D human skeletons. The experiments demonstrate that the approach can achieve up to a 4.20\% relative improvement on human parsing over the baseline model in occlusion scenarios.</p></details> | ICIAP 2025 | None |
| **[Vision Transformer with Sparse Scan Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13335v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Transformers have achieved remarkable progress in computer vision tasks. However, their global modeling often comes with substantial computational overhead, in stark contrast to the human eye's efficient information processing. Inspired by the human eye's sparse scanning mechanism, we propose a \textbf{S}parse \textbf{S}can \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}ttention mechanism ($\rm{S}^3\rm{A}$). This mechanism predefines a series of Anchors of Interest for each token and employs local attention to efficiently model the spatial information around these anchors, avoiding redundant global modeling and excessive focus on local information. This approach mirrors the human eye's functionality and significantly reduces the computational load of vision models. Building on $\rm{S}^3\rm{A}$, we introduce the \textbf{S}parse \textbf{S}can \textbf{Vi}sion \textbf{T}ransformer (SSViT). Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of SSViT across a variety of tasks. Specifically, on ImageNet classification, without additional supervision or training data, SSViT achieves top-1 accuracies of \textbf{84.4\%/85.7\%} with \textbf{4.4G/18.2G} FLOPs. SSViT also excels in downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Its robustness is further validated across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods face limitations such as poor robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly 3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance.

Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing studies focused on tissue semantic segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei instances.

A key technology for extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general 3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains, ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio (PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv) conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping.

| **[SGS-3D: High-Fidelity 3D Instance Segmentation via Reliable Semantic Mask Splitting and Growing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05144v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow" framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene. Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks, thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features, particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects. Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and outdoor environments.

| **[A biologically inspired separable learning vision model for real-time traffic object perception in Dark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05012v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover, there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components: a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise multi-feature alignment.

Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation. Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from \href{https://github.com/OschAI/VisioFirm}{https://github.com/OschAI/VisioFirm}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/OschAI/VisioFirm) |
| **[Unsupervised Instance Segmentation with Superpixels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05352v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications, including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving. Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[treeX: Unsupervised Tree Instance Segmentation in Dense Forest Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03633v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso, RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data. For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design (sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SOPSeg: Prompt-based Small Object Instance Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03002v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery. It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation. Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and will release both the model and dataset to support future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[InstaDA: Augmenting Instance Segmentation Data with Dual-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02973v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel, training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves. Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows, enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of +4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent categories.</p></details> |  | None |

However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale, high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs). The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Identifying Surgical Instruments in Laparoscopy Using Deep Learning Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21399v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy. However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical instruments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Pseudo-Boxes via Data-Level LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Unsupervised 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20530v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space, while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> | None |

Works in this field typically focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks. Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark models and custom tool pose annotation software.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing on-the-fly mobile imaging applications scope the segmentation task to portraits or the salient subject due to the computational constraints. Instance segmentation, despite its recent developments towards efficient networks, is still heavy due to the cost of computation on the entire image to identify all instances. To address this, we propose and formulate a one tap driven single instance segmentation task that segments a single instance selected by a user via a positive tap. This task, in contrast to the broader task of segmenting anything as suggested in the Segment Anything Model \cite{sam}, focuses on efficient segmentation of a single instance specified by the user. To solve this problem, we present TraceNet, which explicitly locates the selected instance by way of receptive field tracing. TraceNet identifies image regions that are related to the user tap and heavy computations are only performed on selected regions of the image. Therefore overall computation cost and memory consumption are reduced during inference. We evaluate the performance of TraceNet on instance IoU average over taps and the proportion of the region that a user tap can fall into for a high-quality single-instance mask. Experimental results on MS-COCO and LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. TraceNet can jointly achieve the efficiency and interactivity, filling in the gap between needs for efficient mobile inference and recent research trend towards multimodal and interactive segmentation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best Student Paper in IEEE MIPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning to Detect Label Errors by Making Them: A Method for Segmentation and Object Detection Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17930v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real label error detection in Cityscapes.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, 2D vision-language models such as CLIP have been widely popularized, due to their impressive capabilities for open-vocabulary grounding in 2D images. Recent works aim to elevate 2D CLIP features to 3D via feature distillation, but either learn neural fields that are scene-specific and hence lack generalization, or focus on indoor room scan data that require access to multiple camera views, which is not practical in robot manipulation scenarios. Additionally, related methods typically fuse features at pixel-level and assume that all camera views are equally informative. In this work, we show that this approach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy, as well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminate uninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features at object-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3D features, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of cluttered tabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances, which we make publicly available. We show that our method reconstructs 3D CLIP features with improved grounding capacity and spatial consistency, while doing so from single-view RGB-D, thus departing from the assumption of multiple camera views at test time. Finally, we show that our approach can generalize to novel tabletop domains and be re-purposed for 3D instance segmentation without fine-tuning, and demonstrate its utility for language-guided robotic grasping in clutter.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets.

However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091 high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will be made publicly available.

Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark.

However, accurate instance segmentation of particles in tomographic data remains challenging due to high morphological variability and frequent particle contact, which limit the effectiveness of classical methods like watershed algorithms. While supervised deep learning approaches offer improved performance, they rely on extensive annotated datasets that are labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose self-validated learning, a novel self-training framework for particle instance segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations. Our method leverages implicit boundary detection and iteratively refines the training set by identifying particles that can be consistently matched across reshuffled scans of the same sample. This self-validation mechanism mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust learning from unlabeled data. After just three iterations, our approach accurately segments over 97% of the total particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in tomographic scans of quartz fragments. Importantly, the framework also enables fully autonomous model evaluation without the need for ground truth annotations, as confirmed through comparisons with state-of-the-art instance segmentation techniques. The method is integrated into the Biomedisa image analysis platform (https://github.com/biomedisa/biomedisa/).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/biomedisa/biomedisa) |

Timely identification of accessible entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling, DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones, including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27 FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time operational requirements.

To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is reduced.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures | None |

The release of several public datasets has significantly advanced research in this area, yet many existing methods struggle with data imbalance issues. To address this challenge, this study introduces a data augmentation method, called NucleiMix, which is designed to balance the distribution of nuclei types by increasing the number of rare-type nuclei within datasets. NucleiMix operates in two phases. In the first phase, it identifies candidate locations similar to the surroundings of rare-type nuclei and inserts rare-type nuclei into the candidate locations. In the second phase, it employs a progressive inpainting strategy using a pre-trained diffusion model to seamlessly integrate rare-type nuclei into their new environments in replacement of major-type nuclei or background locations. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of NucleiMix on three public datasets using two popular nuclei instance segmentation models. The results demonstrate the superior ability of NucleiMix to synthesize realistic rare-type nuclei and to enhance the quality of nuclei segmentation and classification in an accurate and robust manner.</p></details> |  | None |

Although classical post-processing techniques such as watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows.

These methods require training on vast amounts of data usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module. By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data. Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation.</p></details> | Technical report | None |

To address this, we introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps (DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.13518</p></details> | None |

While recent advances have made impressive progress, most methods still unify all background elements into a single representation, hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the 3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are available at our project page.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we present a comprehensive approach to teeth segmentation and orientation from panoramic X-ray images, leveraging deep-learning techniques. We built an end-to-end instance segmentation network that uses an encoder-decoder architecture reinforced with grid-aware attention gates along the skip connections. We introduce oriented bounding box (OBB) generation through principal component analysis (PCA) for precise tooth orientation estimation. Evaluating our approach on the publicly available DNS dataset, comprising 543 panoramic X-ray images, we achieve the highest Intersection-over-Union (IoU) score of 82.43% and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score of 90.37% among compared models in teeth instance segmentation. In OBB analysis, we obtain a Rotated IoU (RIoU) score of 82.82%. We also conduct detailed analyses of individual tooth labels and categorical performance, shedding light on strengths and weaknesses. The proposed model's accuracy and versatility offer promising prospects for improving dental diagnoses, treatment planning, and personalized healthcare in the oral domain.

Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often degrades on domains that differ from their training data.

We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels. Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training, introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel, the content features are aligned with image crop representations and constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D object pose estimation.} Code is available at https://github.com/xiaomoguhz/DeCLIP</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.04410</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/xiaomoguhz/DeCLIP) |

Our recent work introduced GUIDER, our framework for inferring navigation and manipulation intents. We propose augmenting GUIDER with a vision-language model (VLM) and a text-only language model (LLM) to form a semantic prior that filters objects and locations based on the mission prompt. A vision pipeline (YOLO for object detection and the Segment Anything Model for instance segmentation) feeds candidate object crops into the VLM, which scores their relevance given an operator prompt; in addition, the list of detected object labels is ranked by a text-only LLM. These scores weight the existing navigation and manipulation layers of GUIDER, selecting context-relevant targets while suppressing unrelated objects. Once the combined belief exceeds a threshold, autonomy changes occur, enabling the robot to navigate to the desired area and retrieve the desired object, while adapting to any changes in the operator's intent. Future work will evaluate the system on Isaac Sim using a Franka Emika arm on a Ridgeback base, with a focus on real-time assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Human-Centered Robot Autonomy for Human-Robot Teams (HuRoboT) at IEEE RO-MAN 2025, Eindhoven, the Netherlands</p></details> | None |

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning, we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt. Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification performance.

To mitigate this constraint, we propose a novel problem termed Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation (OE-3DIS), which eliminates the necessity for predefined class names during testing. Moreover, we contribute a comprehensive set of strong baselines, derived from OV-3DIS approaches and leveraging 2D Multimodal Large Language Models. To assess the performance of our OE-3DIS system, we introduce a novel Open-Ended score, evaluating both the semantic and geometric quality of predicted masks and their associated class names, alongside the standard AP score. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements over the baselines on the ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ datasets. Remarkably, our method surpasses the performance of Open3DIS, the current state-of-the-art method in OV-3DIS, even in the absence of ground-truth object class names.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCVW'25 - OpenSUN3D: 5th Workshop on Open-World 3D Scene Understanding with Foundation Models</p></details> | None |
| **[Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning for Continual Video Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08612v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames. However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches.

To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation. Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance, significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent occlusions and intricate motion patterns.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Customized Knowledge Distillation for Chip-Level Dense Image Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13174v5)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been revealed that efficient dense image prediction (EDIP) models designed for AI chips, trained using the knowledge distillation (KD) framework, encounter two key challenges, including \emph{maintaining boundary region completeness} and \emph{ensuring target region connectivity}, despite their favorable real-time capacity to recognize the main object regions. In this work, we propose a customized boundary and context knowledge distillation (BCKD) method for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted KD from large accurate teacher models to compact small student models. Specifically, the \emph{boundary distillation} focuses on extracting explicit object-level boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Meanwhile, the \emph{context distillation} leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions. Our proposed method is specifically designed for the EDIP tasks and is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results across semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on five representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BCKD, resulting in well-defined object boundaries and smooth connecting regions.</p></details> | under submission | None |

However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences. Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four benchmarks.

We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically, we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data.

As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where reliability in unseen scenarios is essential. We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, P2F demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across the board.</p></details> |  | None |

We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models, but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through self-training.

Despite existing self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance, the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency, achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting the effectiveness of our approach.

However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets.

| **[Vision transformer-based multi-camera multi-object tracking framework for dairy cow monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01752v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory. Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction through activity quantification and behavioural classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in Smart Agriculture Technology</p></details> | None |
| **[Detection, Pose Estimation and Segmentation for Multiple Bodies: Closing the Virtuous Circle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01562v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation methods work well on isolated people but struggle with multiple-bodies-in-proximity scenarios. Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

| **[UIS-Mamba: Exploring Mamba for Underwater Instance Segmentation via Dynamic Tree Scan and Hidden State Weaken](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00421v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However, due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity.

| **[Beyond the Encoder: Joint Encoder-Decoder Contrastive Pre-Training Improves Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17526v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning methods in self-supervised settings have primarily focused on pre-training encoders, while decoders are typically introduced and trained separately for downstream dense prediction tasks. However, this conventional approach overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon, an efficient encoder-decoder self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that supports joint contrastive pre-training. We first extend existing SSL architectures to accommodate diverse decoders and their corresponding contrastive losses. Then, we introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives to enable the joint pre-training of encoder-decoder architectures. By adapting an established contrastive SSL framework for dense prediction tasks, DeCon achieves new state-of-the-art results: on COCO object detection and instance segmentation when pre-trained on COCO dataset; across almost all dense downstream benchmark tasks when pre-trained on COCO+ and ImageNet-1K. Our results demonstrate that joint pre-training enhances the representation power of the encoder and improves performance in dense prediction tasks. This gain persists across heterogeneous decoder architectures, various encoder architectures, and in out-of-domain limited-data scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass. Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU) scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Details Matter for Indoor Open-vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23134v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary method.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

| **[LITE: A Learning-Integrated Topological Explorer for Multi-Floor Indoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21517v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on multi-floor indoor exploration, which remains an open area of research. Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based explorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust environmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D environments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological explorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the environment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of learning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we incrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based instance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a finite state machine. Additionally, we implement an attention-based 2D exploration policy that utilizes an attention mechanism to capture spatial dependencies between different regions, thereby determining the next global goal for more efficient exploration. Extensive comparison and ablation studies conducted on the HM3D and MP3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed 2D exploration policy significantly outperforms all baseline explorers in terms of exploration efficiency. Furthermore, experiments in several 3D multi-floor environments indicate that our framework is compatible with various 2D exploration methods, facilitating effective multi-floor indoor exploration. Finally, we validate our method in the real world with a quadruped robot, highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> | IROS2025 | None |
| **[Ensemble Foreground Management for Unsupervised Object Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20860v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1) determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks.

Recent advances in computer vision have significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks, such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968 species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification, detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal identification from their traces.

High-fidelity masks are converted into normalized 3D coordinates, from which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy, robustness to small-object crowding, and feasibility for rapid, automated blast-effect assessment in field conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Local2Global query Alignment for Video Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20120v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications. However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge, especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation, abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion. Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries. This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training, surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve 54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MambaVesselNet++: A Hybrid CNN-Mamba Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19931v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data, particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation. Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance segmentation tasks.

At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory (LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of 54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

In this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS) separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation (PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Automated detection of chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic, automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts, and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for journal reviewing</p></details> | None |

These ice clouds can alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.</p></details> |  | None |

Only recently, novel approaches have emerged tackling this problem in an unsupervised fashion. Generally, these approaches first generate pseudo-masks and then train a class-agnostic detector. While such methods deliver the current state of the art, they often fail to correctly separate instances overlapping in 2D image space since only semantics are considered. To tackle this issue, we instead propose to cut the semantic masks in 3D to obtain the final 2D instances by utilizing a point cloud representation of the scene. Furthermore, we derive a Spatial Importance function, which we use to resharpen the semantics along the 3D borders of instances. Nevertheless, these pseudo-masks are still subject to mask ambiguity. To address this issue, we further propose to augment the training of a class-agnostic detector with three Spatial Confidence components aiming to isolate a clean learning signal. With these contributions, our approach outperforms competing methods across multiple standard benchmarks for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

Open datasets for this long-tailed scenario are scarce. We propose the ROADWork dataset to learn to recognize, observe, analyze, and drive through work zones. State-of-the-art foundation models fail when applied to work zones. Fine-tuning models on our dataset significantly improves perception and navigation in work zones. With ROADWork dataset, we discover new work zone images with higher precision (+32.5%) at a much higher rate (12.8$\times$) around the world. Open-vocabulary methods fail too, whereas fine-tuned detectors improve performance (+32.2 AP). Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to describe work zones, but fine-tuning substantially improves performance (+36.7 SPICE). Beyond fine-tuning, we show the value of simple techniques. Video label propagation provides additional gains (+2.6 AP) for instance segmentation. While reading work zone signs, composing a detector and text spotter via crop-scaling improves performance +14.2% 1-NED). Composing work zone detections to provide context further reduces hallucinations (+3.9 SPICE) in VLMs. We predict navigational goals and compute drivable paths from work zone videos.

| **[A2Mamba: Attention-augmented State Space Models for Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16624v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing, have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while having 40% less parameters.

However, robust performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge. Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel, multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of temporal information across entire procedures. We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware, context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support future research in surgical scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cha...</summary><p>A challenge report pre-print containing 36 pages, 15 figures, and 13 tables</p></details> | None |

However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets. Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input. Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages in scene layout synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, Project page: https://xdlbw.github.io/sing3d/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://xdlbw.github.io/sing3d) |

The proposed framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. The framework supports real-time, decentralized operation onboard the robots and has been integrated with three types of aerial and ground platforms. We validate its effectiveness through experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as benchmarks on public datasets and comparisons with existing methods.

However, this task is inherently difficult due to variations in fruit size, shape, occlusion, orientation, and the dynamic nature of orchards where fruits may appear or disappear between observations. In this article, we propose a novel method for fruit instance segmentation and re-identification on 3D terrestrial point clouds collected over time. Our approach directly operates on dense colored point clouds, capturing fine-grained 3D spatial detail. We segment individual fruits using a learning-based instance segmentation method applied directly to the point cloud. For each segmented fruit, we extract a compact and discriminative descriptor using a 3D sparse convolutional neural network. To track fruits across different times, we introduce an attention-based matching network that associates fruits with their counterparts from previous sessions. Matching is performed using a probabilistic assignment scheme, selecting the most likely associations across time. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets of strawberries and apples, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods in both instance segmentation and temporal re-identification, enabling robust and precise fruit monitoring across complex and dynamic orchard environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> | None |

This restricts their applicability in diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$ ($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary $\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that, our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis.

| **[Tree-SLAM: semantic object SLAM for efficient mapping of individual trees in orchards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12093v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate mapping of individual trees is an important component for precision agriculture in orchards, as it allows autonomous robots to perform tasks like targeted operations or individual tree monitoring. However, creating these maps is challenging because GPS signals are often unreliable under dense tree canopies. Furthermore, standard Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches struggle in orchards because the repetitive appearance of trees can confuse the system, leading to mapping errors. To address this, we introduce Tree-SLAM, a semantic SLAM approach tailored for creating maps of individual trees in orchards. Utilizing RGB-D images, our method detects tree trunks with an instance segmentation model, estimates their location and re-identifies them using a cascade-graph-based data association algorithm. These re-identified trunks serve as landmarks in a factor graph framework that integrates noisy GPS signals, odometry, and trunk observations. The system produces maps of individual trees with a geo-localization error as low as 18 cm, which is less than 20\% of the planting distance. The proposed method was validated on diverse datasets from apple and pear orchards across different seasons, demonstrating high mapping accuracy and robustness in scenarios with unreliable GPS signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted to Smart Agricultural Technology</p></details> | None |

However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

However, progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-resolution datasets with precise and cost-effective annotations. We present UAVDB, a new benchmark dataset for UAV detection and segmentation, built upon a point-guided weak supervision pipeline. As its foundation, UAVDB leverages trajectory point annotations and RGB video frames from the multi-view drone tracking dataset, captured by fixed-camera setups. We introduce an efficient annotation method, Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC), which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes directly from these trajectory points, eliminating manual labeling while maintaining accurate spatial localization. We further derive instance segmentation masks from these bounding boxes using the second version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM2), enabling rich multi-task annotations with minimal supervision. UAVDB captures UAVs at diverse scales, from visible objects to near-single-pixel instances, under challenging environmental conditions. Particularly, PIC is lightweight and readily pluggable into other point-guided scenarios, making it easy to scale up dataset generation across domains. We quantitatively compare PIC against existing annotation techniques, demonstrating superior Intersection over Union (IoU) accuracy and annotation efficiency. Finally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO-series detectors on UAVDB, establishing strong baselines for future research.

| **[Spatial Frequency Modulation for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11893v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

While unsupervised CIS (UCIS) models aim to reduce the heavy reliance on labor-intensive image annotations, they fail to accurately capture cell boundaries, causing missed detections and poor performance. Recognizing the absence of error-free instances as a key limitation, we present COIN (COnfidence score-guided INstance distillation), a novel annotation-free framework with three key steps: (1) Increasing the sensitivity for the presence of error-free instances via unsupervised semantic segmentation with optimal transport, leveraging its ability to discriminate spatially minor instances, (2) Instance-level confidence scoring to measure the consistency between model prediction and refined mask and identify highly confident instances, offering an alternative to ground truth annotations, and (3) Progressive expansion of confidence with recursive self-distillation.

To overcome these challenges, we developed TomatoMAP, a comprehensive dataset for Solanum lycopersicum using an Internet of Things (IoT) based imaging system with standardized data acquisition protocols. Our dataset contains 64,464 RGB images that capture 12 different plant poses from four camera elevation angles. Each image includes manually annotated bounding boxes for seven regions of interest (ROIs), including leaves, panicle, batch of flowers, batch of fruits, axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616 high-resolution image subset with pixel-wise semantic and instance segmentation annotations for fine-grained phenotyping. We validated our dataset using a cascading model deep learning framework combining MobileNetv3 for classification, YOLOv11 for object detection, and MaskRCNN for segmentation. Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to the experts. Cohen's Kappa and inter-rater agreement heatmap confirm the reliability of automated fine-grained phenotyping using our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous works in unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, IROS 2025, Interactive Perception, Segmentation, Robotics, Computer Vision</p></details> | None |

This challenge is often addressed through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization (MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its large storage requirements and high computational cost pose challenges for practical deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective strategy for efficient deployment, but we identify two key challenges in SAM that hinder the effectiveness of existing PTQ methods: the heavy-tailed and skewed distribution of post-GELU activations, and significant inter-channel variation in linear projection activations. To address these challenges, we propose AHCPTQ, an accurate and hardware-efficient PTQ method for SAM. AHCPTQ introduces hardware-compatible Hybrid Log-Uniform Quantization (HLUQ) to manage post-GELU activations, employing log2 quantization for dense small values and uniform quantization for sparse large values to enhance quantization resolution. Additionally, AHCPTQ incorporates Channel-Aware Grouping (CAG) to mitigate inter-channel variation by progressively clustering activation channels with similar distributions, enabling them to share quantization parameters and improving hardware efficiency. The combination of HLUQ and CAG not only enhances quantization effectiveness but also ensures compatibility with efficient hardware execution. For instance, under the W4A4 configuration on the SAM-L model, AHCPTQ achieves 36.6% mAP on instance segmentation with the DINO detector, while achieving a 7.89x speedup and 8.64x energy efficiency over its floating-point counterpart in FPGA implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

In LiDAR panoptic segmentation, this challenge becomes even more pronounced due to the need to simultaneously address both semantic and instance segmentation from complex, high-dimensional point cloud data. In this work, we address the challenge of LiDAR panoptic segmentation with very few labeled samples by leveraging recent advances in label-efficient vision panoptic segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel method, Limited-Label LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation (L3PS), which requires only a minimal amount of labeled data. Our approach first utilizes a label-efficient 2D network to generate panoptic pseudo-labels from a small set of annotated images, which are subsequently projected onto point clouds. We then introduce a novel 3D refinement module that capitalizes on the geometric properties of point clouds. By incorporating clustering techniques, sequential scan accumulation, and ground point separation, this module significantly enhances the accuracy of the pseudo-labels, improving segmentation quality by up to +10.6 PQ and +7.9 mIoU. We demonstrate that these refined pseudo-labels can be used to effectively train off-the-shelf LiDAR segmentation networks. Through extensive experiments, we show that L3PS not only outperforms existing methods but also substantially reduces the annotation burden.

High-throughput approaches are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of insect communities.

To overcome these limitations, this work introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets 56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark.

Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.

Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios. In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction, instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval with high success rates.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RAM-W600: A Multi-Task Wrist Dataset and Benchmark for Rheumatoid Arthritis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05193v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis, which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii) Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional radiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level instance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548 images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within the RA-related domain.</p></details> |  | None |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains a challenge. Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for fundamental physics, but analysis of their sparse, complex point cloud data often relies on supervised methods trained on large simulations, introducing potential biases. We introduce the Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE), applying masked point modeling to unlabeled LArTPC images using domain-specific volumetric tokenization and energy prediction. We show this SSL approach learns physically meaningful trajectory representations directly from data. This yields remarkable data efficiency: fine-tuning on just 100 labeled events achieves track/shower semantic segmentation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised baseline trained on $>$100,000 events. Furthermore, internal attention maps exhibit emergent instance segmentation of particle trajectories. While challenges remain, particularly for fine-grained features, we make concrete SSL's potential for building a foundation model for LArTPC image analysis capable of serving as a common base for all data reconstruction tasks. To facilitate further progress, we release PILArNet-M, a large dataset of 1M LArTPC events.

| **[Static Segmentation by Tracking: A Label-Efficient Approach for Fine-Grained Specimen Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06749v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study image segmentation in the biological domain, particularly trait segmentation from specimen images (e.g., butterfly wing stripes, beetle elytra). This fine-grained task is crucial for understanding the biology of organisms, but it traditionally requires manually annotating segmentation masks for hundreds of images per species, making it highly labor-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a label-efficient approach, Static Segmentation by Tracking (SST), based on a key insight: while specimens of the same species exhibit natural variation, the traits of interest show up consistently. This motivates us to concatenate specimen images into a ``pseudo-video'' and reframe trait segmentation as a tracking problem. Specifically, SST generates masks for unlabeled images by propagating annotated or predicted masks from the ``pseudo-preceding'' images. Built upon recent video segmentation models, such as Segment Anything Model 2, SST achieves high-quality trait segmentation with only one labeled image per species, marking a breakthrough in specimen image analysis. To further enhance segmentation quality, we introduce a cycle-consistent loss for fine-tuning, again requiring only one labeled image. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader potential of SST, including one-shot instance segmentation in natural images and trait-based image retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[No time to train! Training-Free Reference-Based Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02798v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of image segmentation models has historically been constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors, as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1) memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).</p></details> | Preprint | None |
| **[Lightweight Structure-Aware Attention for Visual Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16289v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention operator has been widely used as a basic brick in visual understanding since it provides some flexibility through its adjustable kernels. However, this operator suffers from inherent limitations: (1) the attention kernel is not discriminative enough, resulting in high redundancy, and (2) the complexity in computation and memory is quadratic in the sequence length. In this paper, we propose a novel attention operator, called Lightweight Structure-aware Attention (LiSA), which has a better representation power with log-linear complexity. Our operator transforms the attention kernels to be more discriminative by learning structural patterns. These structural patterns are encoded by exploiting a set of relative position embeddings (RPEs) as multiplicative weights, thereby improving the representation power of the attention kernels. Additionally, the RPEs are approximated to obtain log-linear complexity. Our experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed operator outperforms self-attention and other existing operators, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K and other downstream tasks such as video action recognition on Kinetics-400, object detection \& instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE-20K.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Perception Activator: An intuitive and portable framework for brain cognitive exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02311v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress, reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation, confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully exploit or integrate.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D Reconstruction and Information Fusion between Dormant and Canopy Seasons in Commercial Orchards Using Deep Learning and Fast GICP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01912v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system. However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and 13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated, comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 tables, 11 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[NuSegDG: Integration of Heterogeneous Space and Gaussian Kernel for Domain-Generalized Nuclei Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11787v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-generalized nuclei segmentation refers to the generalizability of models to unseen domains based on knowledge learned from source domains and is challenged by various image conditions, cell types, and stain strategies. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great success in universal image segmentation by interactive prompt modes (e.g., point and box). Despite its strengths, the original SAM presents limited adaptation to medical images. Moreover, SAM requires providing manual bounding box prompts for each object to produce satisfactory segmentation masks, so it is laborious in nuclei segmentation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-generalizable framework for nuclei image segmentation, abbreviated to NuSegDG. Specifically, we first devise a Heterogeneous Space Adapter (HS-Adapter) to learn multi-dimensional feature representations of different nuclei domains by injecting a small number of trainable parameters into the image encoder of SAM. To alleviate the labor-intensive requirement of manual prompts, we introduce a Gaussian-Kernel Prompt Encoder (GKP-Encoder) to generate density maps driven by a single point, which guides segmentation predictions by mixing position prompts and semantic prompts. Furthermore, we present a Two-Stage Mask Decoder (TSM-Decoder) to effectively convert semantic masks to instance maps without the manual demand for morphological shape refinement. Based on our experimental evaluations, the proposed NuSegDG demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in nuclei instance segmentation, exhibiting superior domain generalization capabilities.

Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D, calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, NeurIPS 2025 preprint</p></details> | None |
| **[Semantic Equitable Clustering: A Simple and Effective Strategy for Clustering Vision Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13337v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained prominence for its superior relational modeling prowess. However, its global attention mechanism's quadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy spatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in tokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups, thus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling inter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and balanced clustering method, named Semantic Equitable Clustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic relevance in an efficient, straightforward manner. In contrast to traditional clustering methods requiring multiple iterations, our method achieves token clustering in a single pass. Additionally, SEC regulates the number of tokens per cluster, ensuring a balanced distribution for effective parallel processing on current computational platforms without necessitating further optimization. Capitalizing on SEC, we propose a versatile vision backbone, SECViT. Comprehensive experiments in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of SECViT. Moreover, SEC can be conveniently and swiftly applied to multimodal large language models (MLLM), such as LLaVA, to serve as a vision language connector, effectively accelerating the model's efficiency while maintaining unchanged or better performance.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | None |
| **[Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/qhfan/MALA) |

Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF), aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%, 17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the second-best results on structurally complex datasets. More importantly, PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance segmentation tasks. Across all plant datasets, it achieved average improvements of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively. This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of large-scale models in plant science.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies.

Robots can help to automate this process. To do so, they need to be able to perceive the surrounding environment to identify target objects such as trees and plants. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address the problem of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of apple orchards on 3D data from different sensors. Our approach is able to simultaneously provide semantic segmentation, instance segmentation of trunks and fruits, and instance segmentation of trees (a trunk with its fruits). This allows us to identify relevant information such as individual plants, fruits, and trunks, and capture the relationship among them, such as precisely estimate the number of fruits associated to each tree in an orchard. To efficiently evaluate our approach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, we provide a dataset designed specifically for this task. Our dataset is recorded in Bonn, Germany, in a real apple orchard with a variety of sensors, spanning from a terrestrial laser scanner to a RGB-D camera mounted on different robots platforms.

In this work, we treat the model as a multi-task framework, simultaneously performing one-to-one and one-to-many predictions. We investigate the roles of each component in the transformer decoder across these two training targets, including self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward network. Our empirical results demonstrate that any independent component in the decoder can effectively learn both targets simultaneously, even when other components are shared. This finding leads us to propose a multi-route training mechanism, featuring a primary route for one-to-one prediction and two auxiliary training routes for one-to-many prediction. We propose a novel instructive self-attention mechanism, integrated into the first auxiliary route, which dynamically and flexibly guides object queries for one-to-many prediction. For the second auxiliary route, we introduce a route-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to facilitate knowledge sharing while mitigating potential conflicts between routes. Additionally, we apply an MoE to low-scale features in the encoder, optimizing the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The auxiliary routes are discarded during inference. We conduct extensive experiments across various object detection baselines, achieving consistent improvements as demonstrated in Fig. 1. Our method is highly flexible and can be readily adapted to other tasks. To demonstrate its versatility, we conduct experiments on both instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness.

However, when applied to new conditions, these applications frequently face the difficulty of overfitting, resulting in lower segmentation performance. In the context of potato farming, where diseases have a large influence on yields, it is critical for the agricultural economy to quickly and properly identify these diseases. Traditional data augmentation approaches, such as rotation, flip, and translation, have limitations and frequently fail to provide strong generalization results. To address these issues, our research employs a novel approach termed as PotatoGANs. In this novel data augmentation approach, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to generate synthetic potato disease images from healthy potato images. This approach not only expands the dataset but also adds variety, which helps to enhance model generalization. Using the Inception score as a measure, our experiments show the better quality and realisticness of the images created by PotatoGANs, emphasizing their capacity to resemble real disease images closely. The CycleGAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in terms of image quality, as evidenced by its higher IS scores CycleGAN achieves higher Inception scores (IS) of 1.2001 and 1.0900 for black scurf and common scab, respectively. This synthetic data can significantly improve the training of large neural networks. It also reduces data collection costs while enhancing data diversity and generalization capabilities. Our work improves interpretability by combining three gradient-based Explainable AI algorithms (GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM) with three distinct CNN architectures (DenseNet169, Resnet152 V2, InceptionResNet V2) for potato disease classification.</p></details> |  | None |

Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features. In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention mechanism.

| **[Co-Seg++: Mutual Prompt-Guided Collaborative Learning for Versatile Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17159v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances.

| **[LunarLoc: Segment-Based Global Localization on the Moon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16940v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS, is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain, which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings. LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data) |

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) excel in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, their application to instance segmentation for autonomous driving remains underexplored and often relies on suboptimal baselines. We introduce UDA4Inst, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through Semantic Category Training and Bidirectional Mixing Training. Semantic Category Training groups semantically related classes for separate training, improving pseudo-label quality and segmentation accuracy. Bidirectional Mixing Training combines instance-wise and patch-wise data mixing, creating coherent composites that enhance generalization across domains. Extensive experiments show UDA4Inst sets a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA-> Cityscapes benchmark (mAP 31.3) and introduces results on novel datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as sources and Cityscapes and KITTI360 as targets.

However, extensive effort is required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation. The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.</p></details> |  | None |

This makes 360 scene understanding tasks, eg, segmentation and tracking, crucial for appications, such as autonomous driving, robotics. With the recent emergence of foundation models, the community is, however, impeded by the lack of large-scale, labelled real-world datasets. This is caused by the inherent spherical properties, eg, severe distortion in polar regions, and content discontinuities, rendering the annotation costly yet complex. This paper introduces Leader360V, the first large-scale, labeled real-world 360 video datasets for instance segmentation and tracking. Our datasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to natural and dynamic outdoor scenes. To automate annotation, we design an automatic labeling pipeline, which subtly coordinates pre-trained 2D segmentors and large language models to facilitate the labeling. The pipeline operates in three novel stages. Specifically, in the Initial Annotation Phase, we introduce a Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement module, which combines object mask proposals from multiple 2D segmentors with LLM-verified semantic labels. These are then converted into mask prompts to guide SAM2 in generating distortion-aware masks for subsequent frames. In the Auto-Refine Annotation Phase, missing or incomplete regions are corrected either by applying the SDR again or resolving the discontinuities near the horizontal borders. The Manual Revision Phase finally incorporates LLMs and human annotators to further refine and validate the annotations. Extensive user studies and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our labeling pipeline. Meanwhile, experiments confirm that Leader360V significantly enhances model performance for 360 video segmentation and tracking, paving the way for more scalable 360 scene understanding.</p></details> | 23 pages, 16 figures | None |

We systematically analyze the evolution from traditional hand-crafted features to modern deep learning paradigms -- spanning from fully convolutional networks to the latest transformer-based architectures -- and assess their effectiveness in capturing both local and global temporal contexts. Furthermore, our review critically discusses the technical challenges, ranging from maintaining temporal consistency to handling complex scene dynamics, and offers a comprehensive comparative study of datasets and evaluation metrics that have shaped current benchmarking standards. By distilling the key contributions and shortcomings of state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey highlights emerging trends and prospective research directions that promise to further elevate the robustness and adaptability of VSP in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

While state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on end-to-end deep learning architectures and extensive manual annotations of instances, the significant cost and time investment required for labeling large-scale point cloud datasets remains a major bottleneck in this field. In this work, we demonstrate that competitive panoptic segmentation can be achieved using only semantic labels, with instances predicted without any training or annotations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods on standard benchmarks including SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and outperforms every publicly available method on SemanticKITTI as a drop-in instance head replacement, while running in real-time on a single-threaded CPU and requiring no instance labels. It is fully explainable, and requires no learning or parameter tuning.

SAR ship images present challenges including scale variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness and generalization on SAR ship datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures | None |

This is mainly caused by the significant appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A.

A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when applied to diverse real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2024</p></details> | None |

However, this approach lacks contextual information for the masked area, often resulting in unstable performance. In this work, we introduce SmartEraser, built with a new removing paradigm called Masked-Region Guidance. This paradigm retains the masked region in the input, using it as guidance for the removal process. It offers several distinct advantages: (a) it guides the model to accurately identify the object to be removed, preventing its regeneration in the output; (b) since the user mask often extends beyond the object itself, it aids in preserving the surrounding context in the final result. Leveraging this new paradigm, we present Syn4Removal, a large-scale object removal dataset, where instance segmentation data is used to copy and paste objects onto images as removal targets, with the original images serving as ground truths. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartEraser significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in object removal, especially in complex scenes with intricate compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project at: https://longtaojiang.github.io/smarteraser.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://longtaojiang.github.io/smarteraser.github.io) |

A key challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable 8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.</p></details> | Technical report | None |

Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method. Extensive experiments on various modes demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice (quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context. Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification and measurement.</p></details> | 15 pages, 41 figures | None |

To address this bottleneck, we introduce SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives, our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments, making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce $\textbf{LIFT-GS}$, a practical distillation technique that overcomes this limitation by using differentiable rendering to bridge 3D and 2D supervision. LIFT-GS predicts 3D Gaussian representations from point clouds and uses them to render predicted language-conditioned 3D masks into 2D views, enabling supervision from 2D foundation models (SAM, CLIP, LLaMA) without requiring any 3D annotations. This render-supervised formulation enables end-to-end training of complete encoder-decoder architectures and is inherently model-agnostic. LIFT-GS achieves state-of-the-art results with $25.7\%$ mAP on open-vocabulary instance segmentation (vs. $20.2\%$ prior SOTA) and consistent $10-30\%$ improvements on referential grounding tasks. Remarkably, pretraining effectively multiplies fine-tuning datasets by 2X, demonstrating strong scaling properties that suggest 3D VLG currently operates in a severely data-scarce regime.

Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects.

Current monitoring methods involve ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2) temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM) information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations. We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree crown instance segmentation models.</p></details> |  | None |

To allow testing generalization across spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just individual animal re-identification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OpenMaskDINO3D : Reasoning 3D Segmentation via Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04837v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/Zhangkuns/OpenMaskDINO3D</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Zhangkuns/OpenMaskDINO3D) |
| **[Gen-n-Val: Agentic Image Data Generation and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04676v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However, current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CAP-Net: A Unified Network for 6D Pose and Size Estimation of Categorical Articulated Parts from a Single RGB-D Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11230v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper tackles category-level pose estimation of articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks and introduces a new benchmark dataset. While recent methods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on geometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from the point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation for 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images, leading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for estimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method combines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS representations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified network to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets, and NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted class based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part. Finally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to recover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we introduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date, featuring photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real sensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Real-world deployments of our model in robotic tasks underscore its robustness and exceptional sim-to-real transfer capabilities, confirming its substantial practical utility. Our dataset, code and pre-trained models are available on the project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> | None |
| **[Segment Anything for Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00408v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nucleus segmentation is an important analysis task in digital pathology. However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT. Our models are open-source and compatible with popular tools for data annotation. We also provide scripts for whole-slide image segmentation. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/patho-sam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in MIDL 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/patho-sam) |
| **[SPPSFormer: High-quality Superpoint-based Transformer for Roof Plane Instance Segmentation from Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24475v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have been seldom employed in point cloud roof plane instance segmentation, which is the focus of this study, and existing superpoint Transformers suffer from limited performance due to the use of low-quality superpoints. To address this challenge, we establish two criteria that high-quality superpoints for Transformers should satisfy and introduce a corresponding two-stage superpoint generation process. The superpoints generated by our method not only have accurate boundaries, but also exhibit consistent geometric sizes and shapes, both of which greatly benefit the feature learning of superpoint Transformers. To compensate for the limitations of deep learning features when the training set size is limited, we incorporate multidimensional handcrafted features into the model. Additionally, we design a decoder that combines a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with a Transformer module to improve instance prediction and mask extraction. Finally, our network's predictions are refined using traditional algorithm-based postprocessing. For evaluation, we annotated a real-world dataset and corrected annotation errors in the existing RoofN3D dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on our dataset, as well as both the original and reannotated RoofN3D datasets. Moreover, our model is not sensitive to plane boundary annotations during training, significantly reducing the annotation burden. Through comprehensive experiments, we also identified key factors influencing roof plane segmentation performance: in addition to roof types, variations in point cloud density, density uniformity, and 3D point precision have a considerable impact. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating data augmentation strategies that account for point cloud quality to enhance model robustness under diverse and challenging conditions.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures | None |

Our dataset generation tool can render complex 3D scenes containing object meshes, materials, textures, lighting, and backgrounds. Metadata, such as modal and amodal instance segmentation masks, object amodal RGBA instances, occlusion masks, depth maps, bounding boxes, and material properties can be automatically generated to annotate the scene according to the users' requirements. Our tool eliminates the need for manual labeling in the dataset generation process while ensuring the quality and accuracy of the dataset. In this work, we discuss our design goals, framework architecture, and the performance of our tool. We demonstrate the use of a sample dataset generated using SynTable for training a state-of-the-art model, UOAIS-Net. Our state-of-the-art results show significantly improved performance in Sim-to-Real transfer when evaluated on the OSD-Amodal dataset. We offer this tool as an open-source, easy-to-use, photorealistic dataset generator for advancing research in deep learning and synthetic data generation.
