| **[ReScene4D: Temporally Consistent Semantic Instance Segmentation of Evolving Indoor 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11508v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sparse Data Tree Canopy Segmentation: Fine-Tuning Leading Pretrained Models on Only 150 Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10931v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures | None |
| **[YOLO26: Key Architectural Enhancements and Performance Benchmarking for Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25164v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a comprehensive analysis of Ultralytics YOLO26(also called as YOLOv26), highlighting its key architectural enhancements and performance benchmarking for real-time object detection. YOLO26, released in September 2025, stands as the newest and most advanced member of the YOLO family, purpose-built to deliver efficiency, accuracy, and deployment readiness on edge and low-power devices. The paper sequentially details architectural innovations of YOLO26, including the removal of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), adoption of end-to-end NMS-free inference, integration of ProgLoss and Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stable convergence. Beyond architecture, the study positions YOLO26 as a multi-task framework, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, pose/keypoints estimation, oriented detection, and classification. We present performance benchmarks of YOLO26 on edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Orin, comparing its results with YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12, YOLOv13, and transformer-based detectors(RF-DETR and RT-DETR). This paper further explores real-time deployment pathways, flexible export options (ONNX, TensorRT, CoreML, TFLite), and quantization for INT8/FP16. Practical use cases of YOLO26 across robotics, manufacturing, and IoT are highlighted to demonstrate cross-industry adaptability. Finally, insights on deployment efficiency and broader implications are discussed, with future directions for YOLO26 and the YOLO lineage outlined.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Instance camera focus prediction for crystal agglomeration classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09004v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agglomeration refers to the process of crystal clustering due to interparticle forces. Crystal agglomeration analysis from microscopic images is challenging due to the inherent limitations of two-dimensional imaging. Overlapping crystals may appear connected even when located at different depth layers. Because optical microscopes have a shallow depth of field, crystals that are in-focus and out-of-focus in the same image typically reside on different depth layers and do not constitute true agglomeration. To address this, we first quantified camera focus with an instance camera focus prediction network to predict 2 class focus level that aligns better with visual observations than traditional image processing focus measures. Then an instance segmentation model is combined with the predicted focus level for agglomeration classification. Our proposed method has a higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy than the baseline models on ammonium perchlorate crystal and sugar crystal dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SAM-pose2seg: Pose-Guided Human Instance Segmentation in Crowds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08982v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything (SAM) provides an unprecedented foundation for human segmentation, but may struggle under occlusion, where keypoints may be partially or fully invisible. We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model. The code and pretrained models will be available at https://mirapurkrabek.github.io/BBox-MaskPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub: https://github.com/MiraPurkrabek/BBoxMaskPose/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/MiraPurkrabek/BBoxMaskPose) |
| **[3AM: Segment Anything with Geometric Consistency in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08831v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video object segmentation methods like SAM2 achieve strong performance through memory-based architectures but struggle under large viewpoint changes due to reliance on appearance features. Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

However, robust performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge. Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel, multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of temporal information across entire procedures. We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware, context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support future research in surgical scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cha...</summary><p>A challenge report pre-print accepted by the journal Medical Image Analysis (MedIA), containing 37 pages, 15 figures, and 14 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Edge-Optimized Multimodal Learning for UAV Video Understanding via BLIP-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08408v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for real-time visual understanding and interaction in complex scenarios is increasingly critical for unmanned aerial vehicles. However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively. Thirdly, a unified prompt optimization scheme for multi-task adaptation is implemented. This scheme strategically injects structured event logs from the YOLO models as contextual information into BLIP-2's input. Combined with output constraints designed to filter out technical details, this approach effectively guides the model to generate accurate and contextually relevant outputs for various tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Tenth International Conference on Data Mining and Big Data (DMBD'2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Boosting Overlapping Organoid Instance Segmentation Using Pseudo-Label Unmixing and Synthesis-Assisted Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06642v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Organoids, sophisticated in vitro models of human tissues, are crucial for medical research due to their ability to simulate organ functions and assess drug responses accurately. Accurate organoid instance segmentation is critical for quantifying their dynamic behaviors, yet remains profoundly limited by high-quality annotated datasets and pervasive overlap in microscopy imaging. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to alleviate reliance on scarce labeled data, conventional SSL frameworks suffer from biases induced by noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in overlapping regions. Synthesis-assisted SSL (SA-SSL) has been proposed for mitigating training biases in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We present the first adaptation of SA-SSL to organoid instance segmentation and reveal that SA-SSL struggles to disentangle intertwined organoids, often misrepresenting overlapping instances as a single entity. To overcome this, we propose Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU), which identifies erroneous pseudo-labels for overlapping instances and then regenerates organoid labels through instance decomposition. For image synthesis, we apply a contour-based approach to synthesize organoid instances efficiently, particularly for overlapping cases. Instance-level augmentations (IA) on pseudo-labels before image synthesis further enhances the effect of synthetic data (SD). Rigorous experiments on two organoid datasets demonstrate our method's effectiveness, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models using only 10% labeled data, and state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies validate the contributions of PLU, contour-based synthesis, and augmentation-aware training. By addressing overlap at both pseudo-label and synthesis levels, our work advances scalable, label-efficient organoid analysis, unlocking new potential for high-throughput applications in precision medicine.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[iTeach: Interactive Teaching for Robot Perception using Mixed Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09072v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots deployed in the wild often encounter objects and scenes that break pre-trained perception models, yet adapting these models typically requires slow offline data collection, labeling, and retraining. We introduce iTeach, a human-in-the-loop system that enables robots to improve perception continuously as they explore new environments. A human sees the robot's predictions from its own viewpoint, corrects failures in real time, and the informed data drives iterative fine-tuning until performance is satisfactory. A mixed reality headset provides the interface, overlaying predictions in the user's view and enabling lightweight annotation via eye gaze and voice. Instead of tedious frame-by-frame labeling, a human guides the robot to scenes of choice and records short videos while interacting with objects. The human labels only the final frame, and a video segmentation model propagates labels across the sequence, converting seconds of input into dense supervision. The refined model is deployed immediately, closing the loop between human feedback and robot learning. We demonstrate iTeach on Unseen Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS), achieving consistent improvements over a pre-trained MSMFormer baseline on both our collected dataset and the SceneReplica benchmark, where it leads to higher grasping success, followed by a real-world demonstration of grasping unseen objects with a Fetch robot. By combining human judgment, efficient annotation, and on-the-fly refinement, iTeach provides a practical path toward perception systems that generalize robustly in diverse real-world conditions.

| **[Systematic Evaluation of Depth Backbones and Semantic Cues for Monocular Pseudo-LiDAR 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03617v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D object detection offers a low-cost alternative to LiDAR, yet remains less accurate due to the difficulty of estimating metric depth from a single image. We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[LSP-DETR: Efficient and Scalable Nuclei Segmentation in Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03163v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise and scalable instance segmentation of cell nuclei is essential for computational pathology, yet gigapixel Whole-Slide Images pose major computational challenges. Existing approaches rely on patch-based processing and costly post-processing for instance separation, sacrificing context and efficiency. We introduce LSP-DETR (Local Star Polygon DEtection TRansformer), a fully end-to-end framework that uses a lightweight transformer with linear complexity to process substantially larger images without additional computational cost. Nuclei are represented as star-convex polygons, and a novel radial distance loss function allows the segmentation of overlapping nuclei to emerge naturally, without requiring explicit overlap annotations or handcrafted post-processing. Evaluations on PanNuke and MoNuSeg show strong generalization across tissues and state-of-the-art efficiency, with LSP-DETR being over five times faster than the next-fastest leading method.

| **[OVSeg3R: Learn Open-vocabulary Instance Segmentation from 2D via 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23541v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm, which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision, stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of +2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CropNeRF: A Neural Radiance Field-Based Framework for Crop Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00207v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorous crop counting is crucial for effective agricultural management and informed intervention strategies. However, in outdoor field environments, partial occlusions combined with inherent ambiguity in distinguishing clustered crops from individual viewpoints poses an immense challenge for image-based segmentation methods. To address these problems, we introduce a novel crop counting framework designed for exact enumeration via 3D instance segmentation. Our approach utilizes 2D images captured from multiple viewpoints and associates independent instance masks for neural radiance field (NeRF) view synthesis. We introduce crop visibility and mask consistency scores, which are incorporated alongside 3D information from a NeRF model. This results in an effective segmentation of crop instances in 3D and highly-accurate crop counts. Furthermore, our method eliminates the dependence on crop-specific parameter tuning. We validate our framework on three agricultural datasets consisting of cotton bolls, apples, and pears, and demonstrate consistent counting performance despite major variations in crop color, shape, and size. A comparative analysis against the state of the art highlights superior performance on crop counting tasks. Lastly, we contribute a cotton plant dataset to advance further research on this topic.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[UniC-Lift: Unified 3D Instance Segmentation via Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24763v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[Unsupervised Online 3D Instance Segmentation with Synthetic Sequences and Dynamic Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23194v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations. In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | [Code Link](http://github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D) |
| **[BATISNet: Instance Segmentation of Tooth Point Clouds with Boundary Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24201v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of the tooth point cloud is of great significance for diagnosis clinical assisting and treatment planning. Existing methods mostly employ semantic segmentation, focusing on the semantic feature between different types of teeth. However, due to the tightly packed structure of teeth, unclear boundaries, and the diversity of complex cases such as missing teeth, malposed teeth, semantic segmentation often struggles to achieve satisfactory results when dealing with complex dental cases. To address these issues, this paper propose BATISNet, a boundary-aware instance network for tooth point cloud segmentation. This network model consists of a feature extraction backbone and an instance segmentation module. It not only focuses on extracting the semantic features of different types of teeth but also learns the instance features of individual teeth. It helps achieve more robust and accurate tooth instance segmentation in complex clinical scenarios such as missing teeth and malposed teeth. Additionally, to further enhance the completeness and accuracy of tooth boundary segmentation, a boundary-aware loss function is designed to specifically supervise the boundary segmentation between instances. It mitigates effectively tooth adhesion and boundary ambiguity issues. Extensive experimental results show that BATISNet outperforms existing methods in tooth integrity segmentation, providing more reliable and detailed data support for practical clinical applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[SOFTooth: Semantics-Enhanced Order-Aware Fusion for Tooth Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23411v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional (3D) tooth instance segmentation remains challenging due to crowded arches, ambiguous tooth-gingiva boundaries, missing teeth, and rare yet clinically important third molars. Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[3D sans 3D Scans: Scalable Pre-training from Video-Generated Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23042v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in 3D self-supervised learning, collecting large-scale 3D scene scans remains expensive and labor-intensive. In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Lightweight Multi-Scale Attention Framework for Real-Time Spinal Endoscopic Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21984v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is important for identifying and protecting critical anatomy during surgery, but it is difficult because of the narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability. We also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve. Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark.

| **[Retrieving Objects from 3D Scenes with Box-Guided Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19088v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating and retrieving objects from scene-level point clouds is a challenging problem with broad applications in robotics and augmented reality. This task is commonly formulated as open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. Although recent methods demonstrate strong performance, they depend heavily on SAM and CLIP to generate and classify 3D instance masks from images accompanying the point cloud, leading to substantial computational overhead and slow processing that limit their deployment in real-world settings. Open-YOLO 3D alleviates this issue by using a real-time 2D detector to classify class-agnostic masks produced directly from the point cloud by a pretrained 3D segmenter, eliminating the need for SAM and CLIP and significantly reducing inference time. However, Open-YOLO 3D often fails to generalize to object categories that appear infrequently in the 3D training data. In this paper, we propose a method that generates 3D instance masks for novel objects from RGB images guided by a 2D open-vocabulary detector. Our approach inherits the 2D detector's ability to recognize novel objects while maintaining efficient classification, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of rare instances from open-ended text queries.

| **[Chorus: Multi-Teacher Pretraining for Holistic 3D Gaussian Scene Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17817v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3DGS has emerged as a high-fidelity scene representation, encoding rich, general-purpose features directly from its primitives remains under-explored. We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes. Finally, we propose a render-and-distill adaptation that facilitates out-of-domain finetuning. Our code and model will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SGS-3D: High-Fidelity 3D Instance Segmentation via Reliable Semantic Mask Splitting and Growing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05144v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow" framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene. Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks, thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features, particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects. Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and outdoor environments.

To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion. Experiments on ScanNet200 and SceneNN show that MoonSeg3R is the first method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems.

And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.</p></details> | 10 pages, 16 figures | None |

However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss. After training the final model on the resulting dense labelset, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page with Code/Models/Demo: https://leonsick.github.io/s2d/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://leonsick.github.io/s2d) |

Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike 2D images, which are widely accessible, acquiring 3D assets requires specialized expertise or professional 3D scanning equipment, making it difficult to scale and raising copyright concerns. To address these challenges, we propose learning 3D representations from procedural 3D programs that automatically generate 3D shapes using simple 3D primitives and augmentations. Remarkably, despite lacking semantic content, the 3D representations learned from the procedurally generated 3D shapes perform on par with state-of-the-art representations learned from semantically recognizable 3D models (e.g., airplanes) across various downstream 3D tasks, such as shape classification, part segmentation, masked point cloud completion, and both scene semantic and instance segmentation. We provide a detailed analysis on factors that make a good 3D procedural programs. Extensive experiments further suggest that current 3D self-supervised learning methods on point clouds do not rely on semantics of 3D shapes, shedding light on the nature of 3D representations learned.</p></details> | 3DV \ | None |
| **[Enhancing Object Discovery for Unsupervised Instance Segmentation and Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02386v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut (NCut) only once and does not rely on any clustering methods (e.g., K-Means), but it can generate multiple object masks in an image. Our work opens a new direction for NCut algorithm in multi-object segmentation. We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised model, but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks. We believe our method can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

Current methods struggle with generalization due to the scarce annotated 3D scene data or noisy 2D segmentations. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solution, existing 3D scene synthesis methods fail to simultaneously satisfy geometry diversity, context complexity, and layout reasonability, each essential for this task. To address these needs, we propose an Adapted 3D Scene Synthesis pipeline for class-agnostic 3D Instance SegmenTation, termed as ASSIST-3D, to synthesize proper data for model generalization enhancement. Specifically, ASSIST-3D features three key innovations, including 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection from extensive 3D CAD asset collections, incorporating randomness in object sampling to maximize geometric and contextual diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation through LLM-guided spatial reasoning combined with depth-first search for reasonable object placements; and 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D image rendering and fusion from the synthetic scenes, closely mimicking real-world sensor data acquisition. Experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with ASSIST-3D-generated data significantly outperform existing methods. Further comparisons underscore the superiority of our purpose-built pipeline over existing 3D scene synthesis approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, existing IIS methods, primarily designed for natural images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing domains due to limited annotated data and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we proposed RS-ISRefiner, a novel click-based IIS framework tailored for remote sensing images. The framework employs an adapter-based tuning strategy that preserves the general representations of Vision Foundation Models while enabling efficient learning of remote sensing-specific spatial and boundary characteristics. A hybrid attention mechanism integrating convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning enhances robustness against scale diversity and scene complexity. Furthermore, an improved probability map modulation scheme effectively incorporates historical user interactions, yielding more stable iterative refinement and higher boundary accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets, including iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban and WHUBuilding, demonstrate that RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and interaction cost. These results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework, making it highly suitable for high-quality instance segmentation in practical remote sensing scenarios.

This work presents a comprehensive comparison between SAM3 (Segment Anything Model, also called SAMv3) operating in zero-shot mode and three variants of Ultralytics YOLO11 (nano, medium, and large) fine-tuned for instance segmentation. The evaluation is conducted on the MinneApple dataset, a dense benchmark comprising 670 orchard images with 28,179 annotated apple instances, enabling rigorous validation of model behavior under high object density and occlusion. Our analysis shows IoU choices can inflate performance gaps by up to 30%. At the appropriate IoU = 0.15 threshold, YOLO models achieve 68.9%, 72.2%, and 71.9% F1, while SAM3 reaches 59.8% in pure zero-shot mode. However, YOLO exhibits steep degradation 48-50 points across IoU ranges whereas SAM3 drops only 4 points, revealing 12 times superior boundary stability of SAM3. This highlights the strength of SAMv3 in mask precision versus specialization in detection completeness of YOLO11. We provide open-source code, evaluation pipelines, and methodological recommendations, contributing to a deeper understanding of when specialized fine-tuned models or generalist foundation models are preferable for dense instance segmentation tasks.

Existing studies typically formulated different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise a spatio-sequential prompt encoder (SSP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial and sequential relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances.

To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Learning network that fuses two types of visual signals, event-based data and RGB frame data. The proposed Bimodal SegNet network has two distinct encoders, one for each signal input and a spatial pyramidal pooling with atrous convolutions. Encoders capture rich contextual information by pooling the concatenated features at different resolutions while the decoder obtains sharp object boundaries. The evaluation of the proposed method undertakes five unique image degradation challenges including occlusion, blur, brightness, trajectory and scale variance on the Event-based Segmentation (ESD) Dataset. The evaluation results show a 6-10\% segmentation accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean intersection over the union and pixel accuracy.

These models usually require 3D point clouds from laser scanners that are expensive to acquire and require specialist knowledge to use. In this article, we present a graph generation pipeline based on photogrammetry. The pipeline detects relevant objects and predicts their relation using RGB images and depth data generated by a stereo camera. This more cost-effective approach uses deep learning for object detection and instance segmentation of the objects, and employs user-defined heuristics or rules to infer their relations. Results of two hydraulic systems show that this strategy can produce graphs close to the ground truth while its flexibility allows the method to be tailored to specific applications and its transparency qualifies it to be used in the high stakes decision-making that is required for critical infrastructures.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing lightweight Mamba-based backbones cannot demonstrate performance that matches Convolution or Transformer-based methods. By observing, we find that simply modifying the scanning path in the image domain is not conducive to fully exploiting the potential of vision Mamba. In this paper, we first perform comprehensive spectral and quantitative analyses, and verify that the Mamba block mainly models low-frequency information under Convolution-Mamba hybrid architecture. Based on the analyses, we introduce a novel Laplace mixer to decouple the features in terms of frequency and input only the low-frequency components into the Mamba block. In addition, considering the redundancy of the features and the different requirements for high-frequency details and low-frequency global information at different stages, we introduce a frequency ramp inception, i.e., gradually reduce the input dimensions of the high-frequency branches, so as to efficiently trade-off the high-frequency and low-frequency components at different layers. By integrating mobile-friendly convolution and efficient Laplace mixer, we build a series of tiny hybrid vision Mamba called TinyViM. The proposed TinyViM achieves impressive performance on several downstream tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation. In particular, TinyViM outperforms Convolution, Transformer and Mamba-based models with similar scales, and the throughput is about 2-3 times higher than that of other Mamba-based models.

In such scenarios, heavy occlusion weakens geometric boundaries between objects, and large differences in object scale will cause end-to-end models fail to capture both coarse and fine details accurately. Existing 3D point-based methods require costly annotations, while image-guided methods often suffer from semantic inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical image-guided 3D segmentation framework that progressively refines segmentation from instance-level to part-level. Instance segmentation involves rendering a top-view image and projecting SAM-generated masks prompted by YOLO-World back onto the 3D point cloud. Part-level segmentation is subsequently performed by rendering multi-view images of each instance obtained from the previous stage and applying the same 2D segmentation and back-projection process at each view, followed by Bayesian updating fusion to ensure semantic consistency across views. Experiments on real-world factory data demonstrate that our method effectively handles occlusion and structural complexity, achieving consistently high per-class mIoU scores. Additional evaluations on public dataset confirm the generalization ability of our framework, highlighting its robustness, annotation efficiency, and adaptability to diverse 3D environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025 (Sheffield, UK, Nov 24-27, 2025).

A Diagnostic Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06376v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-video models have enabled the generation of high-resolution driving scenes from natural language prompts. These AI-generated driving videos (AIGVs) offer a low-cost, scalable alternative to real or simulator data for autonomous driving (AD). But a key question remains: can such videos reliably support training and evaluation of AD models? We present a diagnostic framework that systematically studies this question. First, we introduce a taxonomy of frequent AIGV failure modes, including visual artifacts, physically implausible motion, and violations of traffic semantics, and demonstrate their negative impact on object detection, tracking, and instance segmentation. To support this analysis, we build ADGV-Bench, a driving-focused benchmark with human quality annotations and dense labels for multiple perception tasks. We then propose ADGVE, a driving-aware evaluator that combines static semantics, temporal cues, lane obedience signals, and Vision-Language Model(VLM)-guided reasoning into a single quality score for each clip. Experiments show that blindly adding raw AIGVs can degrade perception performance, while filtering them with ADGVE consistently improves both general video quality assessment metrics and downstream AD models, and turns AIGVs into a beneficial complement to real-world data. Our study highlights both the risks and the promise of AIGVs, and provides practical tools for safely leveraging large-scale video generation in future AD pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the proliferation of deep neural network architectures for segmentation and phenotyping of 3D plant models in the last decade, the amount of data, and diversity in terms of species and data acquisition modalities are far from sufficient for evaluation of such tools for their generalization ability. To contribute to closing this gap, we introduce PLANesT-3D; a new annotated dataset of 3D color point clouds of plants. PLANesT-3D is composed of 34 point cloud models representing 34 real plants from three different plant species: \textit{Capsicum annuum}, \textit{Rosa kordana}, and \textit{Ribes rubrum}. Both semantic labels in terms of "leaf" and "stem", and organ instance labels were manually annotated for the full point clouds. PLANesT-3D introduces diversity to existing datasets by adding point clouds of two new species and providing 3D data acquired with the low-cost SfM/MVS technique as opposed to laser scanning or expensive setups. Point clouds reconstructed with SfM/MVS modality exhibit challenges such as missing data, variable density, and illumination variations. As an additional contribution, SP-LSCnet, a novel semantic segmentation method that is a combination of unsupervised superpoint extraction and a 3D point-based deep learning approach is introduced and evaluated on the new dataset. The advantages of SP-LSCnet over other deep learning methods are its modular structure and increased interpretability. Two existing deep neural network architectures, PointNet++ and RoseSegNet, were also tested on the point clouds of PLANesT-3D for semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

While many existing approaches rely on semantic segmentation to guide depth completion, they often overlook the benefits of object-level understanding. In this work, we introduce an instance-aware depth completion framework that explicitly integrates binary instance masks as spatial priors to refine depth predictions. Our model combines four main components: a frozen YOLO V11 instance segmentation branch, a U-Net-based depth completion backbone, a cross-attention fusion module, and an attention-guided prediction head. The instance segmentation branch generates per-image foreground masks that guide the depth branch via cross-attention, allowing the network to focus on object-centric regions during refinement. We validate our method on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, showing that it achieves lower RMSE compared to both a U-Net-only baseline and previous semantic-guided methods, while maintaining competitive MAE. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively enhances depth accuracy near object boundaries, occlusions, and thin structures.

While this marks the first integration of language-level concepts within the SAM family, real-world usage typically requires far richer expressions that include attributes, spatial relations, functionalities, actions, states, and even implicit reasoning over instances. Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding. We open-source SAM3-I and provide practical fine-tuning workflows, enabling researchers to adapt it to domain-specific applications.

We attribute this to two key limitations of existing methods: (1) proposal generation relies on dataset-specific proposal networks or mesh-based superpoints, rendering them inapplicable in mesh-free scenarios and limiting generalization to novel scenes; and (2) the weak textual reasoning of CLIP-based classifiers, which struggle to recognize compositional and functional user queries. To address these issues, we introduce OpenTrack3D, a generalizable and accurate framework. Unlike methods that rely on pre-generated proposals, OpenTrack3D employs a novel visual-spatial tracker to construct cross-view consistent object proposals online. Given an RGB-D stream, our pipeline first leverages a 2D open-vocabulary segmenter to generate masks, which are lifted to 3D point clouds using depth. Mask-guided instance features are then extracted using DINO feature maps, and our tracker fuses visual and spatial cues to maintain instance consistency. The core pipeline is entirely mesh-free, yet we also provide an optional superpoints refinement module to further enhance performance when scene mesh is available. Finally, we replace CLIP with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM), significantly enhancing compositional reasoning for complex user queries. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including ScanNet200, Replica, ScanNet++, and SceneFun3D, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO System for Real-time Brain Vessel Segmentation on Transcranial Color-coded Doppler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13875v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Circle of Willis (CoW), vital for ensuring consistent blood flow to the brain, is closely linked to ischemic stroke. Accurate assessment of the CoW is important for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical management. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler (TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature, affordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend heavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and performing accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW auto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No prior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD. In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO) network tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for brain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of 0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame inference speed of 14.199 ms. This system offers a practical solution to reduce reliance on operator experience in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with potential applications in routine clinical workflows and resource-constrained settings. Future research will explore bilateral modeling and larger-scale validation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fast Gaussian Process Approximations for Autocorrelated Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02925v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is concerned with the problem of how to speed up computation for Gaussian process models trained on autocorrelated data. The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the INFORMS Journal on Data Science</p></details> | None |

To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels. All data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/ricoleehduu/STS-Challenge-2025 to ensure reproducibility.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ricoleehduu/STS-Challenge-2025) |

However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks. Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound). Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 9 figures, journal paper</p></details> | None |

Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis</p></details> | None |

The lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the limitations of current synthetic pipelines, particularly in modeling temporal degradations, further hinder progress. Moreover, existing VIS methods are not robust to the degradations found in low-light videos and, as a result, perform poorly even when finetuned on low-light data. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ELVIS} (\textbf{E}nhance \textbf{L}ow-light for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{S}egmentation), a novel framework that enables effective domain adaptation of state-of-the-art VIS models to low-light scenarios. ELVIS comprises an unsupervised synthetic low-light video pipeline that models both spatial and temporal degradations, a calibration-free degradation profile synthesis network (VDP-Net) and an enhancement decoder head that disentangles degradations from content features. ELVIS improves performances by up to \textbf{+3.7AP} on the synthetic low-light YouTube-VIS 2019 dataset. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current text- or image-driven 3D scene generation methods mainly focus on large-scale scenes, struggling to capture the high-density layouts and complex spatial relations that characterize tabletop scenes. To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene. A key component of our framework is a novel pose and scale alignment approach that decouples the complex spatial reasoning into two stages: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for precise rotation recovery and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for robust translation and scale estimation, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D reference. Extensive experiments and user studies show that TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, markedly surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, capable of generating realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://d-robotics-ai-lab.github.io/TabletopGen.project/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://d-robotics-ai-lab.github.io/TabletopGen.project) |

This purely data-driven paradigm often leads to absurd segmentations, especially when the domain of input images is shifted from the one encountered during training. For instance, state-of-the-art models may assign the label "road" to a segment that is included by another segment that is respectively labeled as "sky". However, the ground truth of the existing dataset at hand dictates that such inclusion is not feasible. Our method, Infeasible Semantic Inclusions (InSeIn), first extracts explicit inclusion constraints that govern spatial class relations from the semantic segmentation training set at hand in an offline, data-driven fashion, and then enforces a morphological yet differentiable loss that penalizes violations of these constraints during training to promote prediction feasibility. InSeIn is a light-weight plug-and-play method, constitutes a novel step towards minimizing infeasible semantic inclusions in the predictions of learned segmentation models, and yields consistent and significant performance improvements over diverse state-of-the-art networks across the ADE20K, Cityscapes, and ACDC datasets. https://github.com/SHAMIK-97/InSeIn</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2026 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SHAMIK-97/InSeIn) |

To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground-truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for evaluating brain visual decoding methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Oral).

These attacks can cause misclassification, leading to erroneous driving decisions that compromise road safety. Moreover, within V2X networks, such misinterpretations can propagate, inducing cascading failures that disrupt overall traffic flow and system stability. However, a key limitation of current physical attacks is their lack of stealth. Most methods apply perturbations to central regions of the sign, resulting in visually salient patterns that are easily detectable by human observers, thereby limiting their real-world practicality. This study proposes TESP-Attack, a novel stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic sign classification. Based on the observation that human visual attention primarily focuses on the central regions of traffic signs, we employ instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks that conform to the shape characteristics of the signs. A U-Net generator is utilized to craft adversarial patches, which are then optimized through color and texture constraints along with frequency domain analysis to achieve seamless integration with the background environment, resulting in highly effective visual concealment. The proposed method demonstrates outstanding attack success rates across traffic sign classification models with varied architectures, achieving over 90% under limited query budgets. It also exhibits strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance that remains stable under varying angles and distances.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing IIS methods, primarily designed for natural images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing domains due to limited annotated data and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we proposed RS-ISRefiner, a novel click-based IIS framework tailored for remote sensing images. The framework employs an adapter-based tuning strategy that preserves the general representations of Vision Foundation Models while enabling efficient learning of remote sensing-specific spatial and boundary characteristics. A hybrid attention mechanism integrating convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning enhances robustness against scale diversity and scene complexity. Furthermore, an improved probability map modulation scheme effectively incorporates historical user interactions, yielding more stable iterative refinement and higher boundary fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets, including iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban and WHUBuilding, demonstrate that RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and interaction cost. These results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework, making it highly suitable for high-quality instance segmentation in practical remote sensing scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules is a critical first step in the development of AI-assisted clinical decision support systems. This study focuses on instance segmentation of thyroid nodules using YOLOv5 algorithms on ultrasound images. We evaluated multiple YOLOv5 variants (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge) across two dataset versions, with and without doppler images. The YOLOv5-Large algorithm achieved the highest performance with a dice score of 91\% and mAP of 0.87 on the dataset including doppler images. Notably, our results demonstrate that doppler images, typically excluded by physicians, can significantly improve segmentation performance. The YOLOv5-Small model achieved 79\% dice score when doppler images were excluded, while including them improved performance across all model variants. These findings suggest that instance segmentation with YOLOv5 provides an effective real-time approach for thyroid nodule detection, with potential clinical applications in automated diagnostic systems.</p></details> |  | None |

This feature presents new challenges for route planning, as waiting times at stations must be managed while keeping route durations within limits and reducing total travel distance. This article presents METS, a novel memetic algorithm (MA) with separate constraint-based tour segmentation (SCTS) and a local search procedure tailored for solving GrVRP-PCAFS. METS balances exploration and exploitation through three key components. For exploration, the SCTS strategy splits giant tours to generate diverse solutions, and the search process is guided by a comprehensive fitness evaluation function to dynamically control feasibility and diversity to produce solutions that are both diverse and near-feasible. For exploitation, the local search procedure incorporates tailored move operators with constant-time evaluation mechanisms, enabling efficient examination of large solution neighborhoods. Experimental results demonstrate that METS discovers 31 new best-known solutions out of 40 instances in existing benchmark sets, achieving substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a new large-scale benchmark set based on real-world logistics data is introduced to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  | None |

As 3D training data is generally not as sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation. SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for 3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.6 and +6.8 mAP on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its superiority.</p></details> |  | None |

SynPlay departs from traditional synthetic datasets by addressing a critical but underexplored challenge: localizing humans in aerial scenes where subjects often occupy only tens of pixels in the image. In such scenarios, fine-grained details like facial features or textures become irrelevant, shifting the burden of recognition to human motion, behavior, and interactions. To meet this need, SynPlay implements a novel rule-guided motion generation framework that combines real-world motion capture with motion evolution graphs. This design enables human actions to evolve dynamically through high-level game rules rather than predefined scripts, resulting in effectively uncountable motion variations. Unlike existing synthetic datasets-which either focus on static visual traits or reuse a limited set of mocap-driven actions-SynPlay captures a wide spectrum of spontaneous behaviors, including complex interactions that naturally emerge from unscripted gameplay scenarios. SynPlay also introduces an extensive multi-camera setup that spans UAVs at random altitudes, CCTVs, and a freely roaming UGV, achieving true near-to-far perspective coverage in a single dataset. The majority of instances are captured from aerial viewpoints at varying scales, directly supporting the development of models for long-range human analysis-a setting where existing datasets fall short. Our data contains over 73k images and 6.5M human instances, with detailed annotations for detection, segmentation, and keypoint tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with SynPlay significantly improves human localization performance, especially in few-shot and data-scarce scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://synplaydataset.github.io/</p></details> | None |

CzechLynx contains 39,760 camera trap images annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and covers 319 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two geographically distinct regions: southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians. In addition to the real camera trap data, we provide a large complementary set of photorealistic synthetic images and a Unity-based generation pipeline with diffusion-based text-to-texture modeling, capable of producing arbitrarily large amounts of synthetic data spanning diverse environments, poses, and coat-pattern variations. To enable systematic testing across realistic ecological scenarios, we define three complementary evaluation protocols: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware closed-set, covering cross-regional and long-term monitoring settings. With the provided resources, CzechLynx offers a unique, flexible benchmark for robust evaluation of computer vision and machine learning models across realistic ecological scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at STAG 2025</p></details> | None |

This research aimed to benchmark and advance semi-supervised learning (SSL) as a solution for this data scarcity problem. We organized the 2nd Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation (STS 2024) Challenge at MICCAI 2024. We provided a large-scale dataset comprising over 90,000 2D images and 3D axial slices, which includes 2,380 OPG images and 330 CBCT scans, all featuring detailed instance-level FDI annotations on part of the data. The challenge attracted 114 (OPG) and 106 (CBCT) registered teams. To ensure algorithmic excellence and full transparency, we rigorously evaluated the valid, open-source submissions from the top 10 (OPG) and top 5 (CBCT) teams, respectively. All successful submissions were deep learning-based SSL methods. The winning semi-supervised models demonstrated impressive performance gains over a fully-supervised nnU-Net baseline trained only on the labeled data.

However, the quadratic growth in computational demands as the number of tokens increases limits its practical efficiency. Although recent methods have combined the strengths of convolutions and self-attention to achieve better trade-offs, the expensive pairwise token affinity and complex matrix operations inherent in self-attention remain a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose S2AFormer, an efficient Vision Transformer architecture featuring novel Strip Self-Attention (SSA). We design simple yet effective Hybrid Perception Blocks (HPBs) to effectively integrate the local perception capabilities of CNNs with the global context modeling of Transformer's attention mechanisms. A key innovation of SSA lies in its reduction of the spatial dimensions of $K$ and $V$, while compressing the channel dimensions of $Q$ and $K$. This design significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving accuracy, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness. We evaluate the robustness and efficiency of S2AFormer through extensive experiments on multiple vision benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for image classification, ADE20k for semantic segmentation, and COCO for object detection and instance segmentation. Results demonstrate that S2AFormer achieves significant accuracy gains with superior efficiency in both GPU and non-GPU environments, making it a strong candidate for efficient vision Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE-TIP, 14 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |

To bridge this gap, we propose Saliency-R1, the first unified MLLM framework that jointly tackles three representative and heterogeneous saliency tasks: Salient Object Detection (SOD), Salient Instance Segmentation (SIS), and Co-salient Object Detection (CoSOD), enhancing the model's capacity for saliency reasoning. We introduce a textual interface with structured tags (, ) to encode region- and instance-level referring expressions, enabling a single referring segmenter to produce task-appropriate masks. To train the MLLM efficiently, we propose Confidence-Guided Policy Optimization (CGPO), a novel single-sample reinforcement learning algorithm. CGPO improves on GRPO by replacing group-normalized advantages with a per-sample signal based on reward-confidence discrepancy, thereby reducing computational waste, mitigating signal dilution, and lowering training overhead. Our model exceeds or matches the performance of robust open/closed-source MLLMs and specialized state-of-the-art methods across all three tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our framework in saliency reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text (excluding references): 8 pages, 4 figures; Supplementary Materials (excluding references): 9 pages, 10 figures</p></details> | None |

We are the first to adopt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to distinguish semantic instances in scenes and further leverage these constraints for pixelwise patch deformation on both matching cost and propagation. Concurrently, we propose a unique refinement strategy that combines spherical coordinates and gradient descent on normals and pixelwise search interval on depths, significantly improving the completeness of reconstructed 3D model. Furthermore, we adopt the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to alternately optimize the aggregate matching cost and hyperparameters, effectively mitigating the problem of parameters being excessively dependent on empirical tuning. Evaluations on the ETH3D high-resolution multi-view stereo benchmark and the Tanks and Temples dataset demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art results with less time consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI2024</p></details> | None |

While large vision foundation models have shown promise for zero-shot biomedical segmentation, most existing approaches still depend on dense supervision and computationally expensive fine-tuning. Consequently, training-free methods present a compelling research direction, yet remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce SPROUT, a fully training- and annotation-free prompting framework for nuclear instance segmentation. SPROUT leverages histology-informed priors to construct slide-specific reference prototypes that mitigate domain gaps. These prototypes progressively guide feature alignment through a partial optimal transport scheme. The resulting foreground and background features are transformed into positive and negative point prompts, enabling the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to produce precise nuclear delineations without any parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple histopathology benchmarks demonstrate that SPROUT achieves competitive performance without supervision or retraining, establishing a novel paradigm for scalable, training-free nuclear instance segmentation in pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 40 pages, 25 figures, 18 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

Recent studies have utilized the integration of Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel, training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves. Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows, enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of +4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent categories.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking the Spatial Robustness of DNNs via Natural and Adversarial Localized Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01632v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness of deep neural networks is a crucial factor in safety-critical applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments (e.g., medical or driving scenarios) where localized corruptions can arise. While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remains underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing novel, region-aware metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, along with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of natural localized corruptions. Furthermore, it uncovers the inherent complexity of evaluating worst-case spatial robustness using only a single localized adversarial attack. To address this, the work proposes a region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis to systematically assess model robustness across specific image regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones, and vice versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Pattern Recognition</p></details> | None |

Recent studies have demonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses this challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher networks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features, overlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through multi-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named PFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student network with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation network into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and student-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's ability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation network that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing detection performance. Rigorous evaluations on the widely-used MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that PFADSeg exhibits excellent performance, achieving an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean precision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its high computational and memory costs are a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present Q-SAM2, an accurate low-bit quantization method that achieves high compression and high fidelity. To address performance degradation arising from challenging weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel contributions: Variance-Reduced Calibration (VRC), an initialization method that reduces weight statistical variance by minimizing the Frobenius norm over a small calibration batch; and Learnable Statistical Clipping (LSC), a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) method that learns momentum-stabilized clipping factors to manage outliers in weights and activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 achieves highly accurate inference with substantial efficiency gains, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art general QAT schemes, particularly in the ultra-low 2-bit regime. Specifically, Q-SAM2 achieves an accuracy gain of up to 9.7 ppt in J&F on the video segmentation benchmark and 7.3 ppt in mIoU for instance segmentation over the best competing QAT model, all while achieving an 8x reduction in model size compared to the BF16 baseline.</p></details> | 22 pages | None |
| **[Unsupervised and Source-Free Ranking of Biomedical Segmentation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00450v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model transfer presents a solution to the challenges of segmentation in the biomedical community, where the immense cost of data annotation is a major bottleneck in the use of deep learning. At the same time, hundreds of models get trained on biomedical data, submitted to challenges, and posted in model zoos and repositories. A major hurdle to wider adoption of pre-trained models lies in the lack of methods for best model selection. While such methods have been proposed for classification models, semantic and instance segmentation model ranking remain largely unaddressed, especially in a practically important setting where no labels are available on the target dataset. Similarly, if unsupervised domain adaptation is used, practitioners are faced with the task of selecting the best adapted model without target domain labels. Building on previous work linking model generalisation and consistency under perturbation, we propose the first unsupervised and source-free transferability estimator for semantic and instance segmentation tasks. We evaluate on multiple segmentation problems across biomedical imaging, finding a strong correlation between the rankings based on our estimator and rankings based on target dataset performance.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures | None |

In this paper, we propose PanopticRecon++, an end-to-end method that formulates panoptic reconstruction through a novel cross-attention perspective. This perspective models the relationship between 3D instances (as queries) and the scene's 3D embedding field (as keys) through their attention map. Unlike existing methods that separate the optimization of queries and keys or overlook spatial proximity, PanopticRecon++ introduces learnable 3D Gaussians as instance queries. This formulation injects 3D spatial priors to preserve proximity while maintaining end-to-end optimizability. Moreover, this query formulation facilitates the alignment of 2D open-vocabulary instance IDs across frames by leveraging optimal linear assignment with instance masks rendered from the queries. Additionally, we ensure semantic-instance segmentation consistency by fusing query-based instance segmentation probabilities with semantic probabilities in a novel panoptic head supervised by a panoptic loss. During training, the number of instance query tokens dynamically adapts to match the number of objects. PanopticRecon++ shows competitive performance in terms of 3D and 2D segmentation and reconstruction performance on both simulation and real-world datasets, and demonstrates a user case as a robot simulator.

Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training. SATA demonstrates superior performance on 18 challenging tracking and segmentation benchmarks, offering a novel perspective for more generalizable video understanding.</p></details> | Accpetd by AAAI 2026 | None |

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches address the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose \ourmethodbf, a unified framework for \textbf{CL}ass-incremental \textbf{Imb}alance-aware \textbf{3D}IS. Building upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by up to 16.76\% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30\% mIoU for semantic segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

We introduce CC-DiceCE, a loss function based on the CC-Metrics framework, and compare it with the existing blob loss. Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, albeit at the cost of slightly more false positives. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[A segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm for agricultural multi-robot task allocation with energy constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17076v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot systems have emerged as a key technology for addressing the efficiency and cost challenges in labor-intensive industries. In the representative scenario of smart farming, planning efficient harvesting schedules for a fleet of electric robots presents a highly challenging frontier problem. The complexity arises not only from the need to find Pareto-optimal solutions for the conflicting objectives of makespan and transportation cost, but also from the necessity to simultaneously manage payload constraints and finite battery capacity. When robot loads are dynamically updated during planned multi-trip operations, a mandatory recharge triggered by energy constraints introduces an unscheduled load reset. This interaction creates a complex cascading effect that disrupts the entire schedule and renders traditional optimization methods ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm (SABA). The core of SABA lies in the organic combination of two synergistic mechanisms: the sequential anchoring and balancing mechanism, which leverages charging decisions as `anchors' to systematically reconstruct disrupted routes, while the proportional splitting-based rebalancing mechanism is responsible for the fine-grained balancing and tuning of the final solutions' makespans. Extensive comparative experiments, conducted on a real-world case study and a suite of benchmark instances, demonstrate that SABA comprehensively outperforms 6 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution convergence and diversity. This research provides a novel theoretical perspective and an effective solution for the multi-robot task allocation problem under energy constraints.</p></details> |  | None |

Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy.

Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

In this work, we introduce DynaMimicGen (D-MG), a scalable dataset generation framework that enables policy training from minimal human supervision while uniquely supporting dynamic task settings. Given only a few human demonstrations, D-MG first segments the demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, then leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to adapt and generalize the demonstrated behaviors to novel and dynamically changing environments. Improving prior methods that rely on static assumptions or simplistic trajectory interpolation, D-MG produces smooth, realistic, and task-consistent Cartesian trajectories that adapt in real time to changes in object poses, robot states, or scene geometry during task execution. Our method supports different scenarios - including scene layouts, object instances, and robot configurations - making it suitable for both static and highly dynamic manipulation tasks. We show that robot agents trained via imitation learning on D-MG-generated data achieve strong performance across long-horizon and contact-rich benchmarks, including tasks like cube stacking and placing mugs in drawers, even under unpredictable environment changes. By eliminating the need for extensive human demonstrations and enabling generalization in dynamic settings, D-MG offers a powerful and efficient alternative to manual data collection, paving the way toward scalable, autonomous robot learning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality in real-world scenarios - for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce OMFA (One Model For All), a unified diffusion framework for both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition garments and supports arbitrary poses. OMFA is inspired by language modeling, where generation is guided by conditioning prompts. However, our framework differs fundamentally from LLMs in two key aspects. First, it employs a bidirectional modeling paradigm that symmetrically allows prompting either from the garment to generate try-on results or from the dressed person to recover the try-off garment. Second, it strictly adheres to Tweedie's formula, enabling faithful estimation of the underlying data distribution during the denoising process. Instead of imposing lower body constraints, OMFA is an entirely mask-free framework that requires only a single portrait and a target garment as input, and is designed to support flexible outfit combinations and cross-person garment transfer, making it better aligned with practical usage scenarios. Additionally, by leveraging SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a practical solution for virtual garment synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing WSSS methods struggle with precise object boundary localization and focus only on the most discriminative regions. To address these challenges, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement using object proposals to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete object coverage; (2) Influence Function Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model predictions; and (3) Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement with progressive refinement strategies. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 with 82.3% mIoU before post-processing, improving to 86.6% after CRF refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS methods.

GEO-Bench-2 addresses this with a comprehensive framework spanning classification, segmentation, regression, object detection, and instance segmentation across 19 permissively-licensed datasets. We introduce ''capability'' groups to rank models on datasets that share common characteristics (e.g., resolution, bands, temporality). This enables users to identify which models excel in each capability and determine which areas need improvement in future work. To support both fair comparison and methodological innovation, we define a prescriptive yet flexible evaluation protocol. This not only ensures consistency in benchmarking but also facilitates research into model adaptation strategies, a key and open challenge in advancing GeoFMs for downstream tasks. Our experiments show that no single model dominates across all tasks, confirming the specificity of the choices made during architecture design and pretraining. While models pretrained on natural images (ConvNext ImageNet, DINO V3) excel on high-resolution tasks, EO-specific models (TerraMind, Prithvi, and Clay) outperform them on multispectral applications such as agriculture and disaster response. These findings demonstrate that optimal model choice depends on task requirements, data modalities, and constraints. This shows that the goal of a single GeoFM model that performs well across all tasks remains open for future research. GEO-Bench-2 enables informed, reproducible GeoFM evaluation tailored to specific use cases.

Yet, most existing methods rely on dense supervision with predefined action classes, which are infeasible in open-vocabulary, real-world settings. In this paper, we propose ZOMG, a zero-shot, open-vocabulary framework that segments motion sequences into semantically meaningful sub-actions without requiring any annotations or fine-tuning. Technically, ZOMG integrates (1) language semantic partition, which leverages large language models to decompose instructions into ordered sub-action units, and (2) soft masking optimization, which learns instance-specific temporal masks to focus on frames critical to sub-actions, while maintaining intra-segment continuity and enforcing inter-segment separation, all without altering the pretrained encoder. Experiments on three motion-language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency of motion grounding performance, outperforming prior methods by +8.7\% mAP on HumanML3D benchmark. Meanwhile, significant improvements also exist in downstream retrieval, establishing a new paradigm for annotation-free motion understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing DocVQA datasets are limited to the page level and lack fine grained spatial grounding, constraining the interpretability and reasoning capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this gap, we introduce BBox DocVQA a large scale, bounding box grounded dataset designed to enhance spatial reasoning and evidence localization in visual documents. We further present an automated construction pipeline, Segment Judge and Generate, which integrates a segment model for region segmentation, a VLM for semantic judgment, and another advanced VLM for question answer generation, followed by human verification for quality assurance. The resulting dataset contains 3.6 K diverse documents and 32 K QA pairs, encompassing single and multi region as well as single and multi page scenarios. Each QA instance is grounded on explicit bounding boxes, enabling fine grained evaluation of spatial semantic alignment. Benchmarking multiple state of the art VLMs (e.g., GPT 5, Qwen2.5 VL, and InternVL) on BBox DocVQA reveals persistent challenges in spatial grounding and reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, fine tuning on BBox DocVQA substantially improves both bounding box localization and answer generation, validating its effectiveness for enhancing the reasoning ability of VLMs. Our dataset and code will be publicly released to advance research on interpretable and spatially grounded vision language reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Segmentation-Aware Latent Diffusion for Satellite Image Super-Resolution: Enabling Smallholder Farm Boundary Delineation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14481v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Generalization of Depth Estimation Foundation Model via Weakly-Supervised Adaptation with Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14238v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ISBI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[S4M: 4-points to Segment Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05534v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) promises to ease the annotation bottleneck in medical segmentation, but overlapping anatomy and blurred boundaries make its point prompts ambiguous, leading to cycles of manual refinement to achieve precise masks. Better prompting strategies are needed. Methods: We propose a structured prompting strategy using 4 points as a compact instance-level shape description. We study two 4-point variants: extreme points and the proposed major/minor axis endpoints, inspired by ultrasound measurement practice. SAM cannot fully exploit such structured prompts because it treats all points identically and lacks geometry-aware reasoning. To address this, we introduce S4M (4-points to Segment Anything), which augments SAM to interpret 4 points as relational cues rather than isolated clicks. S4M expands the prompt space with role-specific embeddings and adds an auxiliary "Canvas" pretext task that sketches coarse masks directly from prompts, fostering geometry-aware reasoning. Results: Across eight datasets in ultrasound and surgical endoscopy, S4M improves segmentation by +3.42 mIoU over a strong SAM baseline at equal prompt budget. An annotation study with three clinicians further shows that major/minor prompts enable faster annotation. Conclusion: S4M increases performance, reduces annotation effort, and aligns prompting with clinical practice, enabling more scalable dataset development in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Delineate Anything Flow: Fast, Country-Level Field Boundary Detection from Any Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13417v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate delineation of agricultural field boundaries from satellite imagery is essential for land management and crop monitoring, yet existing methods often produce incomplete boundaries, merge adjacent fields, and struggle to scale. We present the Delineate Anything Flow (DelAnyFlow) methodology, a resolution-agnostic approach for large-scale field boundary mapping. DelAnyFlow combines the DelAny instance segmentation model, based on a YOLOv11 backbone and trained on the large-scale Field Boundary Instance Segmentation-22M (FBIS 22M) dataset, with a structured post-processing, merging, and vectorization sequence to generate topologically consistent vector boundaries. FBIS 22M, the largest dataset of its kind, contains 672,909 multi-resolution image patches (0.25-10m) and 22.9million validated field instances. The DelAny model delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with over 100% higher mAP and 400x faster inference than SAM2. DelAny demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and supports national-scale applications: using Sentinel 2 data for 2024, DelAnyFlow generated a complete field boundary layer for Ukraine (603,000km2) in under six hours on a single workstation. DelAnyFlow outputs significantly improve boundary completeness relative to operational products from Sinergise Solutions and NASA Harvest, particularly in smallholder and fragmented systems (0.25-1ha). For Ukraine, DelAnyFlow delineated 3.75M fields at 5m and 5.15M at 2.5m, compared to 2.66M detected by Sinergise Solutions and 1.69M by NASA Harvest. This work delivers a scalable, cost-effective methodology for field delineation in regions lacking digital cadastral data.

This work presents a computer vision based framework for group activity recognition and action spotting using a combination of deep learning models and graph based relational reasoning. The system first applies Mask R-CNN to obtain accurate actor localization through bounding boxes and instance masks. Multiple backbone networks, including Inception V3, MobileNet, and VGG16, are used to extract feature maps, and RoIAlign is applied to preserve spatial alignment when generating actor specific features. The mask information is then fused with the feature maps to obtain refined masked feature representations for each actor. To model interactions between individuals, we construct Actor Relation Graphs that encode appearance similarity and positional relations using methods such as normalized cross correlation, sum of absolute differences, and dot product. Graph Convolutional Networks operate on these graphs to reason about relationships and predict both individual actions and group level activities. Experiments on the Collective Activity dataset demonstrate that the combination of mask based feature refinement, robust similarity search, and graph neural network reasoning leads to improved recognition performance across both crowded and non crowded scenarios. This approach highlights the potential of integrating segmentation, feature extraction, and relational graph reasoning for complex video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards 3D Object-Centric Feature Learning for Semantic Scene Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13031v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has received growing attention due to its potential in autonomous driving. While most existing approaches follow an ego-centric paradigm by aggregating and diffusing features over the entire scene, they often overlook fine-grained object-level details, leading to semantic and geometric ambiguities, especially in complex environments. To address this limitation, we propose Ocean, an object-centric prediction framework that decomposes the scene into individual object instances to enable more accurate semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight segmentation model, MobileSAM, to extract instance masks from the input image. Then, we introduce a 3D Semantic Group Attention module that leverages linear attention to aggregate object-centric features in 3D space. To handle segmentation errors and missing instances, we further design a Global Similarity-Guided Attention module that leverages segmentation features for global interaction. Finally, we propose an Instance-aware Local Diffusion module that improves instance features through a generative process and subsequently refines the scene representation in the BEV space. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that Ocean achieves state-of-the-art performance, with mIoU scores of 17.40 and 20.28, respectively.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI-2026 | None |

Inspired by the multi-scale modeling of classic Mask2Former-based models, we propose Seg-VAR, a novel framework that rethinks segmentation as a conditional autoregressive mask generation problem. This is achieved by replacing the discriminative learning with the latent learning process. Specifically, our method incorporates three core components: (1) an image encoder generating latent priors from input images, (2) a spatial-aware seglat (a latent expression of segmentation mask) encoder that maps segmentation masks into discrete latent tokens using a location-sensitive color mapping to distinguish instances, and (3) a decoder reconstructing masks from these latents. A multi-stage training strategy is introduced: first learning seglat representations via image-seglat joint training, then refining latent transformations, and finally aligning image-encoder-derived latents with seglat distributions. Experiments show Seg-VAR outperforms previous discriminative and generative methods on various segmentation tasks and validation benchmarks. By framing segmentation as a sequential hierarchical prediction task, Seg-VAR opens new avenues for integrating autoregressive reasoning into spatial-aware vision systems.

Current benchmarks for video understanding typically emphasize isolated single-instance text inputs and fail to evaluate the capacity to sustain temporal reasoning throughout the entire duration of video streams. To address these limitations, we introduce SVBench, a pioneering benchmark with temporal multi-turn question-answering chains specifically designed to thoroughly assess the capabilities of streaming video understanding of current LVLMs. We design a semi-automated annotation pipeline to obtain 49,979 Question-Answer (QA) pairs of 1,353 streaming videos, which includes generating QA chains that represent a series of consecutive multi-turn dialogues over video segments and constructing temporal linkages between successive QA chains. Our experimental results, obtained from 14 models in dialogue and streaming evaluations, reveal that while the closed-source GPT-4o outperforms others, most open-source LVLMs struggle with long-context streaming video understanding. We also construct a StreamingChat model, which significantly outperforms open-source LVLMs on our SVBench and achieves comparable performance on diverse vision-language benchmarks. We expect SVBench to advance the research of streaming video understanding by providing a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of current LVLMs. Our benchmark and model can be accessed at https://github.com/sotayang/SVBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Accepted (Spotlight)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/sotayang/SVBench) |

While state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on end-to-end deep learning architectures and extensive manual annotations of instances, the significant cost and time investment required for labeling large-scale point cloud datasets remains a major bottleneck in this field. In this work, we demonstrate that competitive panoptic segmentation can be achieved using only semantic labels, with instances predicted without any training or annotations. Our method outperforms {most} state-of-the-art supervised methods on standard benchmarks including SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and outperforms every publicly available method on SemanticKITTI as a drop-in instance head replacement, while running in real-time on a single-threaded CPU and requiring no instance labels.

Although post-training quantization (PTQ) offers a promising compression solution, existing methods yield unsatisfactory results when applied to SAM, owing to its specialized model components and promptable workflow: (i) The mask decoder's attention exhibits extreme activation outliers, and we find that aggressive clipping (even 100x), without smoothing or isolation, is effective in suppressing outliers while maintaining performance. Unfortunately, traditional distribution-based metrics (e.g., MSE) fail to provide such large-scale clipping. (ii) Existing quantization reconstruction methods neglect semantic interactivity of SAM, leading to misalignment between image feature and prompt intention. To address the above issues, we propose SAQ-SAM in this paper, which boosts PTQ for SAM from the perspective of semantic alignment. Specifically, we propose Perceptual-Consistency Clipping, which exploits attention focus overlap to promote aggressive clipping while preserving semantic capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Prompt-Aware Reconstruction, which incorporates image-prompt interactions by leveraging cross-attention in mask decoder, thus facilitating alignment in both distribution and semantic. Moreover, to ensure the interaction efficiency, we design a layer-skipping strategy for image tokens in encoder. Extensive experiments are conducted on various SAM sizes and tasks, including instance segmentation, oriented object detection, and semantic segmentation, and the results show that our method consistently exhibits advantages. For example, when quantizing SAM-B to 4-bit, SAQ-SAM achieves 11.7% higher mAP than the baseline in instance segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026.

Designing a model general enough to be employed for all kinds of novel objects without (re-) training has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we present a new training-free framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). NOCTIS integrates two pre-trained models: Grounded-SAM 2 for object proposals with precise bounding boxes and corresponding segmentation masks; and DINOv2 for robust class and patch embeddings, due to its zero-shot capabilities. Internally, the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings with a new cyclic thresholding (CT) mechanism that mitigates unstable matches caused by repetitive textures or visually similar patterns. Beyond CT, NOCTIS introduces: (i) an appearance score that is unaffected by object selection bias; (ii) the usage of the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and mask as a scoring component; and (iii) an RGB-only pipeline that performs even better than RGB-D ones. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods regarding the mean AP score on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, CVPR 2026 preprint</p></details> | None |

These fundamental problems in computer vision are powered by large-scale, painstakingly annotated datasets. Despite their impact, these datasets are costly to build, biased in coverage, and difficult to scale. Synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative but struggle with flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity. We introduce Synthetic Object Compositions (SOC), an accurate and scalable data synthesis pipeline via a novel object-centric composition strategy. It composes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation and camera configuration augmentation with generative harmonization and mask-area-weighted blending, yielding accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on just 100K of our synthetic images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) and synthetic pipelines (Copy-Paste, X-Paste, SynGround, SegGen) by +24-36% -- achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO. Beyond the general open-vocabulary setup, SOC also enables controllable dataset construction for different use cases and boosts performance in both low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments delivers strong performance across different real-data scales and yields even greater improvements under extremely limited real-data conditions, including +6.59 AP on a 1% COCO data setup.

However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

To address these limitations, we propose R1-Compress, a two-stage chunk-level compression framework that preserves both local information and coherence. Our method segments Long-CoT into manageable chunks, applies LLM-driven inner-chunk compression, and employs an inter-chunk search mechanism to select the short and coherent sequence.

Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

| **[OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01892v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With over 760 stars on GitHub and being part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer is the default tool for applying graph-based optimizations to ONNX models. Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

However, existing driving datasets for dense semantic perception are either dominated by images captured under normal conditions or are small in scale. To address this, we introduce ACDC, the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences for training and testing methods for diverse semantic perception tasks on adverse visual conditions. ACDC consists of a large set of 8012 images, half of which (4006) are equally distributed between four common adverse conditions: fog, nighttime, rain, and snow. Each adverse-condition image comes with a high-quality pixel-level panoptic annotation, a corresponding image of the same scene under normal conditions, and a binary mask that distinguishes between intra-image regions of clear and uncertain semantic content. 1503 of the corresponding normal-condition images feature panoptic annotations, raising the total annotated images to 5509. ACDC supports the standard tasks of semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation, as well as the newly introduced uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation. A detailed empirical study demonstrates the challenges that the adverse domains of ACDC pose to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches and indicates the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field. Our dataset and benchmark are publicly available at https://acdc.vision.ee.ethz.ch</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE T-PAMI 2025.

However, existing pipelines mostly yield semantic-level prompts, which drive SAM to coarse semantic masks and struggle to handle multiple discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical limitation, we propose an \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF) tailored for the first training-free COS that upgrades prompt granularity from semantic to instance-level while keeping all components frozen. The centerpiece is an Instance Mask Generator that (i) leverages a detector-agnostic enumerator to produce precise instance-level box prompts for the foreground tag, and (ii) introduces the Single-Foreground Multi-Background Prompting (SFMBP) strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts within each box prompt, enabling SAM to output instance masks. The pipeline is supported by a simple text prompt generator that produces image-specific tags and a self-consistency vote across synonymous task-generic prompts to stabilize inference. Extensive evaluations on three COS benchmarks, two CIS benchmarks, and two downstream datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | under review | None |

We present OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks. ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances. iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities, generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks.

| **[LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel scan, has recently emerged as a linearly-scaling alternative to self-attention. Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan to restore a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward scan and executes it in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs) and show that it constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. Under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. Our method also boosts the accuracy of four SOTA Mamba models, namely VMamba, LocalVim, PlainMamba and Adventurer, by 0.5% to 3.4%. We integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) model, MambaMIL, which is unidirectional. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy.

In recent years, large-scale pretrained visual foundation models, exemplified by DINO, have advanced rapidly and demonstrated remarkable performance on complex downstream tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that DINO can serve as an effective feature learner for UIS, and we introduce DiveSeg, a novel framework built upon two insightful components: (1) The AquaStyle Aligner, designed to embed underwater color style features into the DINO fine-tuning process, facilitating better adaptation to the underwater domain. (2) The ObjectPrior Prompter, which incorporates binary segmentation-based prompts to deliver object-level priors, provides essential guidance for instance segmentation task that requires both object- and instance-level reasoning. We conduct thorough experiments on the popular UIIS and USIS10K datasets, and the results show that DiveSeg achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

To address this limitation, we investigate synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) as an enhancement to standard diffusion-based protocols. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across six state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 200 patients with co-registered CDI$^s$, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences. We demonstrate that CDI$^s$ integration reliably enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of evaluated configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% statistically significant relative improvement over baseline modalities. CDI$^s$ + DWI emerges as the safest enhancement pathway, achieving significant improvements in half of evaluated architectures with zero instances of degradation. Since CDI$^s$ derives from existing DWI acquisitions without requiring additional scan time or architectural modifications, it enables immediate deployment in clinical workflows. Our results establish validated integration pathways for CDI$^s$ as a practical drop-in enhancement for PCa lesion segmentation tasks across diverse deep learning architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ML4H 2025 Findings</p></details> | None |

Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCAD 2025</p></details> | None |

Additional categorization of cells, based on morphology, aims to enhance the utilization of image data for cancer cell research. Glioma C6 consists of two parts: the first is curated with controlled parameters for benchmarking, while the second supports generalization testing under varying conditions. We evaluate the performance of several generalist segmentation models, highlighting their limitations on our dataset.

However, the repeated exchange of model updates in FL can result in prohibitively high communication costs, hindering the distributed learning process. To address this challenge, we propose EcoLoRA, a novel communication-efficient federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs. Leveraging the modular structure, we propose a round-robin segment sharing scheme, where each client uploads only a complementary LoRA segment per round to reduce network bandwidth. It is further combined with adaptive sparsification methods tailored to LoRA's training dynamics and lossless encoding techniques. We conduct extensive evaluations on both question-answering and value-alignment tasks across multiple datasets and models. The results show that EcoLoRA significantly reduces communication overhead without compromising performance. For instance, it reduces communication time by up to 79% and total training time by up to 65%.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike prior approaches that feed text-derived SEG token embeddings into segmentation models, NOVO instead generates a coarse mask and point prompts from the VLM output. These visual prompts are compatible with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), preserving alignment with its pretrained capabilities. To further enhance boundary quality and enable instance-level segmentation, we introduce a training-free refinement module that reduces visual artifacts and improves the quality of segmentation masks. We also present RISeg, a new benchmark comprising 918 images, 2,533 instance-level masks, and diverse reasoning queries to evaluate this task.

Developing such systems often requires large, well-annotated datasets, but existing resources often address isolated tasks, neglect temporal dependencies, or lack multi-center variability. We present the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) dataset, comprising eight complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos recorded at three medical centers. The dataset provides frame-level annotations for three interconnected tasks: surgical phase recognition (485,875 frames), instrument keypoint estimation (19,435 frames), and instrument instance segmentation (19,435 frames). PhaKIR is, to our knowledge, the first multi-institutional dataset to jointly provide phase labels, instrument pose information, and pixel-accurate instrument segmentations, while also enabling the exploitation of temporal context since full surgical procedure sequences are available. It served as the basis for the PhaKIR Challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) Challenge at MICCAI 2024 to benchmark methods in surgical scene understanding, thereby further validating the dataset's quality and relevance.

Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures. Our objective is to improve performance across three tasks: instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification using realistic and operational training sets. Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%). To simplify use and encourage uptake, we integrated the tasks into a unified framework, streamlining the process from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification. Pretrained models reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by ~21%. This open-source contribution aims to accelerate operational extraction of individual tree information from laser scanning point clouds to support forestry, biodiversity, and carbon mapping.</p></details> |  | None |

Remote sensing surveys complement field-based approaches, and their reach can be especially great when combined with deep learning and computer vision techniques. However, conventional supervised deep learning methods face challenges in annotating fine-grained archaeological features at scale. While recent vision foundation models have shown remarkable success in learning large-scale remote sensing data with minimal annotations, most off-the-shelf solutions are designed for RGB images rather than multi-spectral satellite imagery, such as the 8-band data used in our study. In this paper, we introduce DeepAndes, a transformer-based vision foundation model trained on three million multi-spectral satellite images, specifically tailored for Andean archaeology. DeepAndes incorporates a customized DINOv2 self-supervised learning algorithm optimized for 8-band multi-spectral imagery, marking the first foundation model designed explicitly for the Andes region. We evaluate its image understanding performance through imbalanced image classification, image instance retrieval, and pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments show that DeepAndes achieves superior F1 scores, mean average precision, and Dice scores in few-shot learning scenarios, significantly outperforming models trained from scratch or pre-trained on smaller datasets. This underscores the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised pre-training in archaeological remote sensing.

Existing research have often focused on online construction of high-definition maps. For instance, the Maptr[9] series employ a detection-based method to output vectorized map instances parallelly in an end-to-end manner. However, despite their capability for real-time construction, detection-based methods are observed to lack robust generalizability[19], which hampers their applicability in auto-labeling systems. Therefore, aiming to improve the generalizability, we reinterpret road elements as rasterized polygons and design a concise framework based on instance segmentation. Initially, a segmentation-based transformer is employed to deliver instance masks in an end-to-end manner; succeeding this step, a Potrace-based[17] post-processing module is used to ultimately yield vectorized map elements. Quantitative results attained on the Nuscene[1] dataset substantiate the effectiveness and generaliz-ability of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

While previous studies have mainly focused on segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of 0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups. These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis, and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

No Problem: Pose-Agnostic and Instance-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05055v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain) adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE, particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments. To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation network, by removing static objects including background components. To further boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map. Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework, PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable performance improvements in MDE during TTA.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, it is a laborious task that requires expertise from trained physicians. The large nuclei variability across different organ tissues and acquisition processes challenges the automation of this task. On the other hand, data annotations are expensive to obtain, and thus, Deep Learning (DL) models are challenged to generalize to unseen organs or different domains. This work proposes Local-to-Global NuSegHop (LG-NuSegHop), a self-supervised pipeline developed on prior knowledge of the problem and molecular biology. There are three distinct modules: (1) a set of local processing operations to generate a pseudolabel, (2) NuSegHop a novel data-driven feature extraction model and (3) a set of global operations to post-process the predictions of NuSegHop. Notably, even though the proposed pipeline uses { no manually annotated training data} or domain adaptation, it maintains a good generalization performance on other datasets. Experiments in three publicly available datasets show that our method outperforms other self-supervised and weakly supervised methods while having a competitive standing among fully supervised methods. Remarkably, every module within LG-NuSegHop is transparent and explainable to physicians.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data, while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance, providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks.

This study used the BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset, a selected subset of the BraTS dataset that included 60 multimodal MRI cases from patients with glioma. Surprisingly, the nnU Net model trained on the initial 60 instances performed better than the network trained on an offline-augmented dataset of 360 cases. Hypothetically, the offline augmentations introduced artificial anatomical variances or intensity distributions, reducing generalization. In contrast, the original dataset, when paired with nnU Net's robust online augmentation procedures, maintained realistic variability and produced better results. The study achieved a Dice score of 0.84 for whole tumor segmentation. These findings highlight the significance of data quality and proper augmentation approaches in constructing accurate, generalizable medical picture segmentation models, particularly for under-represented locations.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures | None |

Open datasets for this long-tailed scenario are scarce. We propose the ROADWork dataset to learn to recognize, observe, analyze, and drive through work zones. State-of-the-art foundation models fail when applied to work zones. Fine-tuning models on our dataset significantly improves perception and navigation in work zones. With ROADWork dataset, we discover new work zone images with higher precision (+32.5%) at a much higher rate (12.8$\times$) around the world. Open-vocabulary methods fail too, whereas fine-tuned detectors improve performance (+32.2 AP). Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to describe work zones, but fine-tuning substantially improves performance (+36.7 SPICE). Beyond fine-tuning, we show the value of simple techniques. Video label propagation provides additional gains (+2.6 AP) for instance segmentation. While reading work zone signs, composing a detector and text spotter via crop-scaling improves performance +14.2% 1-NED). Composing work zone detections to provide context further reduces hallucinations (+3.9 SPICE) in VLMs. We predict navigational goals and compute drivable paths from work zone videos. Incorporating road work semantics ensures 53.6% goals have angular error (AE) < 0.5 (+9.9 %) and 75.3% pathways have AE < 0.5 (+8.1 %).</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> | None |
| **[From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological studies.</p></details> |  | None |

SAM-based interactive segmentation has gained attention for its strong generalization, but most methods follow a single-point-to-single-object paradigm, which limits multi-lesion segmentation. Moreover, ViT backbones capture global context but often miss high-fidelity local details. We propose MIQ-SAM3D, a multi-instance 3D segmentation framework with a competitive query optimization strategy that shifts from single-point-to-single-mask to single-point-to-multi-instance. A prompt-conditioned instance-query generator transforms a single point prompt into multiple specialized queries, enabling retrieval of all semantically similar lesions across the 3D volume from a single exemplar. A hybrid CNN-Transformer encoder injects CNN-derived boundary saliency into ViT self-attention via spatial gating. A competitively optimized query decoder then enables end-to-end, parallel, multi-instance prediction through inter-query competition. On LiTS17 and KiTS21 dataset, MIQ-SAM3D achieved comparable levels and exhibits strong robustness to prompts, providing a practical solution for efficient annotation of clinically relevant multi-lesion cases.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaling Tumor Segmentation: Best Lessons from Real and Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14831v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data, we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130 tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver, kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23 expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs. It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |
| **[Class-agnostic 3D Segmentation by Granularity-Consistent Automatic 2D Mask Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00785v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D instance segmentation is an important task for real-world applications. To avoid costly manual annotations, existing methods have explored generating pseudo labels by transferring 2D masks from foundation models to 3D. However, this approach is often suboptimal since the video frames are processed independently. This causes inconsistent segmentation granularity and conflicting 3D pseudo labels, which degrades the accuracy of final segmentation. To address this, we introduce a Granularity-Consistent automatic 2D Mask Tracking approach that maintains temporal correspondences across frames, eliminating conflicting pseudo labels. Combined with a three-stage curriculum learning framework, our approach progressively trains from fragmented single-view data to unified multi-view annotations, ultimately globally coherent full-scene supervision. This structured learning pipeline enables the model to progressively expose to pseudo-labels of increasing consistency. Thus, we can robustly distill a consistent 3D representation from initially fragmented and contradictory 2D priors. Experimental results demonstrated that our method effectively generated consistent and accurate 3D segmentations. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and open-vocabulary ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in Pattern Recognition</p></details> | None |

Existing surgical action triplet recognition methods are limited to learning from frame-level classification, failing to reliably link actions to specific instrument instances.Previous attempts at spatial grounding have primarily relied on class activation maps, which lack the precision and robustness required for detailed instrument-tissue interaction analysis.To address this gap, we propose grounding surgical action triplets with instrument instance segmentation, or triplet segmentation for short, a new unified task which produces spatially grounded  outputs.We start by presenting CholecTriplet-Seg, a large-scale dataset containing over 30,000 annotated frames, linking instrument instance masks with action verb and anatomical target annotations, and establishing the first benchmark for strongly supervised, instance-level triplet grounding and evaluation.To learn triplet segmentation, we propose TargetFusionNet, a novel architecture that extends Mask2Former with a target-aware fusion mechanism to address the challenge of accurate anatomical target prediction by fusing weak anatomy priors with instrument instance queries.Evaluated across recognition, detection, and triplet segmentation metrics, TargetFusionNet consistently improves performance over existing baselines, demonstrating that strong instance supervision combined with weak target priors significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of surgical action understanding.Triplet segmentation establishes a unified framework for spatially grounding surgical action triplets. The proposed benchmark and architecture pave the way for more interpretable, surgical scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery. YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales, improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000 annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP). Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance, particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering actionable insights for future developments in remote sensing and geospatial intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advances have made impressive progress, most methods still unify all background elements into a single representation, hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the 3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are available at our project page.</p></details> |  | None |

Given an image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy.

In this paper, we present ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest, simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks, including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems(NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

While ANN-to-SNN conversion (ANN2SNN) achieves high accuracy without end-to-end SNN training, existing methods rely on large time steps, leading to high inference latency and computational cost. In this paper, we propose a theoretical and practical framework for single-timestep ANN2SNN. We establish the Temporal-to-Spatial Equivalence Theory, proving that multi-timestep integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons can be equivalently replaced by single-timestep multi-threshold neurons (MTN). Based on this theory, we introduce the Scale-and-Fire Neuron (SFN), which enables effective single-timestep ($T=1$) spiking through adaptive scaling and firing. Furthermore, we develop the SFN-based Spiking Transformer (SFormer), a specialized instantiation of SFN within Transformer architectures, where spike patterns are aligned with attention distributions to mitigate the computational, energy, and hardware overhead of the multi-threshold design. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under single-timestep inference. Notably, we achieve 88.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K at $T=1$, surpassing existing conversion methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike Referring Image Segmentation on general images, acquiring high-quality referring expressions in the remote sensing domain is particularly challenging due to the prevalence of small, densely distributed objects and complex backgrounds. This paper introduces a new learning paradigm, Weakly Referring Expression Learning (WREL) for RRSIS, which leverages abundant class names as weakly referring expressions together with a small set of accurate ones to enable efficient training under limited annotation conditions. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that mixed-referring training yields a provable upper bound on the performance gap relative to training with fully annotated referring expressions, thereby establishing the validity of this new setting. We also propose LRB-WREL, which integrates a Learnable Reference Bank (LRB) to refine weakly referring expressions through sample-specific prompt embeddings that enrich coarse class-name inputs. Combined with a teacher-student optimization framework using dynamically scheduled EMA updates, LRB-WREL stabilizes training and enhances cross-modal generalization under noisy weakly referring supervision. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark with varying weakly referring data ratios validate both the theoretical insights and the practical effectiveness of WREL and LRB-WREL, demonstrating that they can approach or even surpass models trained with fully annotated referring expressions.</p></details> |  | None |

While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically, SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9% retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.</p></details> |  | None |

Therefore, long-tailed classification is the key to deep learning at scale. However, existing methods are mainly based on re-weighting/re-sampling heuristics that lack a fundamental theory. In this paper, we establish a causal inference framework, which not only unravels the whys of previous methods, but also derives a new principled solution. Specifically, our theory shows that the SGD momentum is essentially a confounder in long-tailed classification. On one hand, it has a harmful causal effect that misleads the tail prediction biased towards the head. On the other hand, its induced mediation also benefits the representation learning and head prediction. Our framework elegantly disentangles the paradoxical effects of the momentum, by pursuing the direct causal effect caused by an input sample. In particular, we use causal intervention in training, and counterfactual reasoning in inference, to remove the "bad" while keep the "good". We achieve new state-of-the-arts on three long-tailed visual recognition benchmarks: Long-tailed CIFAR-10/-100, ImageNet-LT for image classification and LVIS for instance segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2020.

Our previous work, SI Maps (Nanwani L, Agarwal A, Jain K, et al. Instance-level semantic maps for vision language navigation. In: 2023 32nd IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). IEEE; 2023 Aug.), showed that having instance-level information and the semantic understanding of an environment helps significantly improve performance for language-guided tasks. We extend this instance-level approach to 3D while increasing the pipeline's robustness and improving quantitative and qualitative results. Our method leverages foundational models for object recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction. We propose a representation that results in a 3D point cloud map with instance-level embeddings, which bring in the semantic understanding that natural language commands can query. Quantitatively, the work improves upon the success rate of language-guided tasks. At the same time, we qualitatively observe the ability to identify instances more clearly and leverage the foundational models and language and image-aligned embeddings to identify objects that, otherwise, a closed-set approach wouldn't be able to identify.

MUVR aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos, tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance) and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3) Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base, Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches.

Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height, and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes. Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes, and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement, and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we introduce CircleSnake, a simple end-to-end segmentation approach that utilizes circle contour deformation for segmenting ball-shaped medical objects at the instance level. The innovation of CircleSnake lies in these three areas: (1) It substitutes the complex bounding box-to-octagon contour transformation with a more consistent and rotation-invariant bounding circle-to-circle contour adaptation. This adaptation specifically targets ball-shaped medical objects. (2) The circle representation employed in CircleSnake significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to two, compared to eight in the octagon representation. This reduction enhances both the robustness of the segmentation performance and the rotational consistency of the method. (3) CircleSnake is the first end-to-end deep instance segmentation pipeline to incorporate circle representation, encompassing consistent circle detection, circle contour proposal, and circular convolution in a unified framework. This integration is achieved through the novel application of circular graph convolution within the context of circle detection and instance segmentation. In practical applications, such as the detection of glomeruli, nuclei, and eosinophils in pathological images, CircleSnake has demonstrated superior performance and greater rotation invariance when compared to benchmarks.

| **[Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

However, existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations, we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship between the instance field and language field, through a novel instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics.

| **[PlantSegNeRF: A few-shot, cross-species method for plant 3D instance point cloud reconstruction via joint-channel NeRF with multi-view image instance matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00371v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Organ segmentation of plant point clouds is a prerequisite for the high-resolution and accurate extraction of organ-level phenotypic traits. Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF), aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%, 17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the second-best results on structurally complex species. More importantly, PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance segmentation tasks. Across all plant species, it achieved average improvements of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively. This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of large-scale models in plant science.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Prototypes to Sparse ECG Explanations: SHAP-Driven Counterfactuals for Multivariate Time-Series Multi-class Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19514v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining 81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection (13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion from Post-hoc Attributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01687v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules - a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define human-readable intervals that indicate where and when decision-relevant segments occur and can enhance model transparency by localizing threshold-based conditions on the raw series. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations - a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon - into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR may improve interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks by providing concise, human-readable rules aligned with model predictions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring significant manual effort and expertise to ensure reliable outcomes. This work presents a pipeline for neuron instance segmentation and measurement based on a high-resolution dataset of stem-cell-derived neurons. The proposed method uses YOLOv8, trained on manually annotated microscopy images. The model achieved high segmentation accuracy, exceeding 97%. In addition, the pipeline utilized both ground truth and predicted masks to extract biologically significant features, including cell length, width, area, and grayscale intensity values. The overall accuracy of the extracted morphological measurements reached 75.32%, further supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This integrated framework offers a valuable tool for automated analysis in cell imaging and neuroscience research, reducing the need for manual annotation and enabling scalable, precise quantification of neuron morphology.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures and 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[OpenInsGaussian: Open-vocabulary Instance Gaussian Segmentation with Context-aware Cross-view Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18253v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes. However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary \textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[gen2seg: Generative Models Enable Generalizable Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15263v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs, generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE (encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on our website.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://reachomk.github.io/gen2seg/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://reachomk.github.io/gen2seg) |

The inherent chal- lenges of bright-field images - their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology - coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis frame- work designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular archi- tecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications - particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.

| **[Periodontal Bone Loss Analysis via Keypoint Detection With Heuristic Post-Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13477v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a deep learning framework and annotation methodology for the automatic detection of periodontal bone loss landmarks, associated conditions, and staging. 192 periapical radiographs were collected and annotated with a stage agnostic methodology, labelling clinically relevant landmarks regardless of disease presence or extent. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that aligns predicted keypoints to tooth boundaries using an auxiliary instance segmentation model. An evaluation metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), is proposed to capture keypoint performance in dental imaging domains. Four donor pose estimation models were adapted with fine-tuning for our keypoint problem. Post-processing improved fine-grained localisation, raising average PRCK^{0.05} by +0.028, but reduced coarse performance for PRCK^{0.25} by -0.0523 and PRCK^{0.5} by -0.0345. Orientation estimation shows excellent performance for auxiliary segmentation when filtered with either stage 1 object detection model. Periodontal staging was detected sufficiently, with the best mesial and distal Dice scores of 0.508 and 0.489, while furcation involvement and widened periodontal ligament space tasks remained challenging due to scarce positive samples. Scalability is implied with similar validation and external set performance. The annotation methodology enables stage agnostic training with balanced representation across disease severities for some detection tasks. The PRCK metric provides a domain-specific alternative to generic pose metrics, while the heuristic post-processing module consistently corrected implausible predictions with occasional catastrophic failures. The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of clinically interpretable periodontal bone loss assessment, with potential to reduce diagnostic variability and clinician workload.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 tables, 9 figures, 1 equation, journal paper submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> | None |
| **[3D Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02236v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

To address these challenges, we propose KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input. Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE (KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their kinematic properties.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the degraded underwater environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring, camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module (CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning, effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands, improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Integrating them with open-vocabulary object detection (OVD), instance segmentation, and tracking leverages their strengths while mitigating these drawbacks. We utilize VLM-generated structured descriptions to identify visible object instances, collect application-relevant attributes, and inform an open-vocabulary detector to extract corresponding bounding boxes that are passed to a video segmentation model providing segmentation masks and tracking. Once initialized, this model directly extracts segmentation masks, processing image streams in real time with minimal computational overhead. Tracks can be updated online as needed by generating new structured descriptions and detections. This combines the descriptive power of VLMs with the grounding capability of OVD and the pixel-level understanding and speed of video segmentation. Our evaluation across datasets and robotics platforms demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, showcasing its ability to extract task-specific attributes from non-standard objects in dynamic environments.

| **[BARL: Bilateral Alignment in Representation and Label Spaces for Semi-Supervised Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16863v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures | None |

We trace two practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps) often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance; and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse, user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB \(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, model, and demos can be found at https://envision-research.github.io/STANCE/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://envision-research.github.io/STANCE) |

Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA) that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL) selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR. The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene segmentation, and automated skill assessment.

Object re-identification is challenging across different viewpoints and in scenes with significant appearance variation arising from weather or lighting changes. Existing works on object re-identification either focus on specific classes or require foreground segmentation. Further, these methods, along with object re-identification datasets, have limited consideration of challenges such as outdoor scenes and illumination changes. To address this problem, we introduce CODa Re-ID: an in-the-wild object re-identification dataset containing 1,037,814 observations of 557 objects across 8 classes under diverse lighting conditions and viewpoints. Further, we propose CLOVER, a representation learning method for object observations that can distinguish between static object instances without requiring foreground segmentation. We also introduce MapCLOVER, a method for scalably summarizing CLOVER descriptors for use in object maps and matching new observations to summarized descriptors. Our results show that CLOVER achieves superior performance in static object re-identification under varying lighting conditions and viewpoint changes and can generalize to unseen instances and classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[On Non-interactive Evaluation of Animal Communication Translators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15768v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,'' false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations, which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early stages of learning to translate.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contact-Aware Safety in Soft Robots Using High-Order Control Barrier and Lyapunov Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03841v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating alongside people, particularly in sensitive scenarios such as aiding the elderly with daily tasks or collaborating with workers in manufacturing, must guarantee safety and cultivate user trust. Continuum soft manipulators promise safety through material compliance, but as designs evolve for greater precision, payload capacity, and speed, and increasingly incorporate rigid elements, their injury risk resurfaces. In this letter, we introduce a comprehensive High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) + High-Order Control Lyapunov Function (HOCLF) framework that enforces strict contact force limits across the entire soft-robot body during environmental interactions. Our approach combines a differentiable Piecewise Cosserat-Segment (PCS) dynamics model with a convex-polygon distance approximation metric, named Differentiable Conservative Separating Axis Theorem (DCSAT), based on the soft robot geometry to enable real-time, whole-body collision detection, resolution, and enforcement of the safety constraints. By embedding HOCBFs into our optimization routine, we guarantee safety, allowing, for instance, safe navigation in operational space under HOCLF-driven motion objectives. Extensive planar simulations demonstrate that our method maintains safety-bounded contacts while achieving precise shape and task-space regulation. This work thus lays a foundation for the deployment of soft robots in human-centric environments with provable safety and performance.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

The dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date, location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and 1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded, non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains, highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/linty5/ClapperText.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, accepted at ICDAR2025 DALL</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/linty5/ClapperText) |
| **[RankSEG-RMA: An Efficient Segmentation Algorithm via Reciprocal Moment Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15362v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image with its corresponding class, and is typically evaluated using the Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice metrics to quantify the overlap between predicted and ground-truth segmentation masks. In the literature, most existing methods estimate pixel-wise class probabilities, then apply argmax or thresholding to obtain the final prediction. These methods have been shown to generally lead to inconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize segmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation framework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU specifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively. Although RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a complexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents the number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2), thus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with RankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule. Second, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where multiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard benchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper, we overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of RankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA, namely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while maintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a pixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for non-overlapping segmentation settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MARIS: Marine Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation with Geometric Enhancement and Semantic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15398v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS} (\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance \underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components. The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM}) enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future underwater perception research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data and thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial for MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.41%), video object segmentation (29.83%), object detection (46.22%), and multiple object tracking (44.94%). We will release our code.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is prepared to submit to the IEEE Transactions</p></details> | None |

However, their high computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy. Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |
| **[TRACE: Your Diffusion Model is Secretly an Instance Edge Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07982v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality instance and panoptic segmentation has traditionally relied on dense instance-level annotations such as masks, boxes, or points, which are costly, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Unsupervised and weakly-supervised approaches reduce this burden but remain constrained by semantic backbone constraints and human bias, often producing merged or fragmented outputs. We present TRACE (TRAnsforming diffusion Cues to instance Edges), showing that text-to-image diffusion models secretly function as instance edge annotators. TRACE identifies the Instance Emergence Point (IEP) where object boundaries first appear in self-attention maps, extracts boundaries through Attention Boundary Divergence (ABDiv), and distills them into a lightweight one-step edge decoder. This design removes the need for per-image diffusion inversion, achieving 81x faster inference while producing sharper and more connected boundaries. On the COCO benchmark, TRACE improves unsupervised instance segmentation by +5.1 AP, and in tag-supervised panoptic segmentation it outperforms point-supervised baselines by +1.7 PQ without using any instance-level labels. These results reveal that diffusion models encode hidden instance boundary priors, and that decoding these signals offers a practical and scalable alternative to costly manual annotation.

Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[One Bug, Hundreds Behind: LLMs for Large-Scale Bug Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14036v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fixing bugs in large programs is a challenging task that demands substantial time and effort. Once a bug is found, it is reported to the project maintainers, who work with the reporter to fix it and eventually close the issue. However, across the program, there are often similar code segments, which may also contain the bug, but were missed during discovery. Finding and fixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more concerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they provide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other parts of the program. In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear repeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different programs, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our investigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise the security of software programs. This paper introduces BugStone, a program analysis system empowered by LLVM and a Large Language Model (LLM). The key observation is that many RPBs have one patched instance, which can be leveraged to identify a consistent error pattern, such as a specific API misuse. By examining the entire program for this pattern, it is possible to identify similar sections of code that may be vulnerable. Starting with 135 unique RPBs, BugStone identified more than 22K new potential issues in the Linux kernel. Manual analysis of 400 of these findings confirmed that 246 were valid. We also created a dataset from over 1.9K security bugs reported by 23 recent top-tier conference works. We manually annotate the dataset, identify 80 recurring patterns and 850 corresponding fixes. Even with a cost-efficient model choice, BugStone achieved 92.2% precision and 79.1% pairwise accuracy on the dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UniVector: Unified Vector Extraction via Instance-Geometry Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13234v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images, offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons, polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures. This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons, polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector) |

The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical application-particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.

However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density. Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854 and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods. The code and dataset are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/pangjunbiao/Abnormal-Stop-Detection-SSL.git}</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/pangjunbiao/Abnormal-Stop-Detection-SSL.git) |

However, complementarity between such heterogeneous architectures has not been well exploited in self-supervised learning. Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which enforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is heterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model with new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural changes. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on various heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We discover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their architecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a search strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a specific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to enlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various self-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

To mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage. However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining computationally efficient.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a novel framework that fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550 instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification (tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1 score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1 score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded 93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets, incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further enhance operational scalability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Surface-Aware Distilled 3D Semantic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18254v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many 3D tasks such as pose alignment, animation, motion transfer, and 3D reconstruction rely on establishing correspondences between 3D shapes. This challenge has recently been approached by pairwise matching of semantic features from pre-trained vision models. However, despite their power, these features struggle to differentiate instances of the same semantic class such as ``left hand'' versus ``right hand'' which leads to substantial mapping errors. To solve this, we learn a surface-aware embedding space that is robust to these ambiguities while facilitating shared mapping for an entire family of 3D shapes. Importantly, our approach is self-supervised and requires only a small number of unpaired training meshes to infer features for new possibly imperfect 3D shapes at test time. We achieve this by introducing a contrastive loss that preserves the semantic content of the features distilled from foundational models while disambiguating features located far apart on the shape's surface. We observe superior performance in correspondence matching benchmarks and enable downstream applications including 2D-to-3D and 3D-to-3D texture transfer, in-part segmentation, pose alignment, and motion transfer in low-data regimes. Unlike previous pairwise approaches, our solution constructs a joint embedding space, where both seen and unseen 3D shapes are implicitly aligned without further optimization.

To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over real-world data.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Cell Instance Segmentation: The Devil Is in the Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09848v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity, which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge, we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries), to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions On Medical Imaging (TMI)</p></details> | None |

Conditions such as heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images. Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP) of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP of only 35.69%.

However, the high cost and scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods, while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully supervised methods in some scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SOS: Synthetic Object Segments Improve Detection, Segmentation, and Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09110v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity. We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K) on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4 $N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in visual grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/weikaih04/SOS</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/weikaih04/SOS) |
| **[FOLK: Fast Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation via Label-guided Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08849v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from 2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled 3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC, 22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%), compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Global Representation from Queries for Vectorized HD Map Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06969v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches, particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose \textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD \textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit, global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to leading baselines.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |
| **[CAST: Contrastive Adaptation and Distillation for Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21904v4)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation demands costly per-pixel annotations and computationally expensive models. We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework that compresses pre-trained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM(s) via self-training with contrastive calibration, (2) knowledge transfer through a unified multi-objective loss, and (3) student refinement to mitigate residual pseudo-label bias. Central to CAST is an \emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask and class scores to extract informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11x smaller student improves over its zero-shot VFM teacher(s) by +8.5 and +7.1 AP, surpasses adapted teacher(s) by +3.4 and +1.5 AP, and further outperforms state-of-the-art SSKD methods on both benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SubGrapher: Visual Fingerprinting of Chemical Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19695v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic extraction of chemical structures from scientific literature plays a crucial role in accelerating research across fields ranging from drug discovery to materials science. Patent documents, in particular, contain molecular information in visual form, which is often inaccessible through traditional text-based searches. In this work, we introduce SubGrapher, a method for the visual fingerprinting of chemical structure images. Unlike conventional Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) models that attempt to reconstruct full molecular graphs, SubGrapher focuses on extracting molecular fingerprints directly from chemical structure images. Using learning-based instance segmentation, SubGrapher identifies functional groups and carbon backbones, constructing a substructure-based fingerprint that enables chemical structure retrieval. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art OCSR and fingerprinting methods, demonstrating superior retrieval performance and robustness across diverse molecular depictions. The dataset, models, and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On Enhancing Delay SLAs in TCP Networks through Joint Routing and Transport Assistant Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05686v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transport Control Protocol has long been the primary transport protocol for applications requiring performance and reliability over the Internet. Unfortunately, due its retransmission mechanism, TCP incurs high packet delivery delays when segments are lost. To address this issue, previous research proposed to use a novel network function, namely Transport Assistant, deployed within the network to cache and retransmit lost packets, thus reducing retransmission delays. In this paper, we propose to jointly route the flows and deploy TAs in order to minimize packet delivery delays in best-effort networks (scenario 1) or to satisfy delay-based Service Level Agreements in QoS-based networks (scenario 2). We hence formulate the joint routing and TA deployment problem as Integer Linear Program for the two scenarios and propose a heuristic solution for large-scale instances of the problem. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the benefits of performing joint routing flows and TA deployment in reducing packet delivery delays (up to 16.4%) while minimizing deployment costs (up to 60.98%).</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures | None |
| **[Dropping the D: RGB-D SLAM Without the Depth Sensor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06216v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale, marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Overlap-aware segmentation for topological reconstruction of obscured objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06194v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The separation of overlapping objects presents a significant challenge in scientific imaging. While deep learning segmentation-regression algorithms can predict pixel-wise intensities, they typically treat all regions equally rather than prioritizing overlap regions where attribution is most ambiguous. Recent advances in instance segmentation show that weighting regions of pixel overlap in training can improve segmentation boundary predictions in regions of overlap, but this idea has not yet been extended to segmentation regression. We address this with Overlap-Aware Segmentation of ImageS (OASIS): a new segmentation-regression framework with a weighted loss function designed to prioritize regions of object-overlap during training, enabling extraction of pixel intensities and topological features from heavily obscured objects. We demonstrate OASIS in the context of the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to directly image the Migdal effect--a rare process where electron emission is induced by nuclear scattering--in a low-pressure optical time projection chamber. This setting poses an extreme test case, as the target for reconstruction is a faint electron recoil track which is often heavily-buried within the orders-of-magnitude brighter nuclear recoil track. Compared to unweighted training, OASIS improves median intensity reconstruction errors from -32% to -14% for low-energy electron tracks (4-5 keV) and improves topological intersection-over-union scores from 0.828 to 0.855. These performance gains demonstrate OASIS's ability to recover obscured signals in overlap-dominated regions. The framework provides a generalizable methodology for scientific imaging where pixels represent physical quantities and overlap obscures features of interest. All code is openly available to facilitate cross-domain adoption.</p></details> |  | None |
