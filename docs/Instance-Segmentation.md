| **[Scene-Aware Location Modeling for Data Augmentation in Automotive Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17076v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative image models are increasingly being used for training data augmentation in vision tasks. In the context of automotive object detection, methods usually focus on producing augmented frames that look as realistic as possible, for example by replacing real objects with generated ones. Others try to maximize the diversity of augmented frames, for example by pasting lots of generated objects onto existing backgrounds. Both perspectives pay little attention to the locations of objects in the scene. Frame layouts are either reused with little or no modification, or they are random and disregard realism entirely. In this work, we argue that optimal data augmentation should also include realistic augmentation of layouts. We introduce a scene-aware probabilistic location model that predicts where new objects can realistically be placed in an existing scene. By then inpainting objects in these locations with a generative model, we obtain much stronger augmentation performance than existing approaches. We set a new state of the art for generative data augmentation on two automotive object detection tasks, achieving up to $2.8\times$ higher gains than the best competing approach ($+1.4$ vs. $+0.5$ mAP boost). We also demonstrate significant improvements for instance segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Anonymization: Object Scrubbing for Privacy-Preserving 2D and 3D Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16557v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ROAR (Robust Object Removal and Re-annotation), a scalable framework for privacy-preserving dataset obfuscation that eliminates sensitive objects instead of modifying them. Our method integrates instance segmentation with generative inpainting to remove identifiable entities while preserving scene integrity. Extensive evaluations on 2D COCO-based object detection show that ROAR achieves 87.5% of the baseline detection average precision (AP), whereas image dropping achieves only 74.2% of the baseline AP, highlighting the advantage of scrubbing in preserving dataset utility. The degradation is even more severe for small objects due to occlusion and loss of fine-grained details. Furthermore, in NeRF-based 3D reconstruction, our method incurs a PSNR loss of at most 1.66 dB while maintaining SSIM and improving LPIPS, demonstrating superior perceptual quality. Our findings establish object removal as an effective privacy framework, achieving strong privacy guarantees with minimal performance trade-offs. The results highlight key challenges in generative inpainting, occlusion-robust segmentation, and task-specific scrubbing, setting the foundation for future advancements in privacy-preserving vision systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[NVSMask3D: Hard Visual Prompting with Camera Pose Interpolation for 3D Open Vocabulary Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14638v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities in image-level visual perception tasks. However, they fall short in 3D instance-level segmentation tasks that require accurate localization and recognition of individual objects. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting based hard visual prompting approach that leverages camera interpolation to generate diverse viewpoints around target objects without any 2D-3D optimization or fine-tuning. Our method simulates realistic 3D perspectives, effectively augmenting existing hard visual prompts by enforcing geometric consistency across viewpoints. This training-free strategy seamlessly integrates with prior hard visual prompts, enriching object-descriptive features and enabling VLMs to achieve more robust and accurate 3D instance segmentation in diverse 3D scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Occlusion-Ordered Semantic Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14054v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard semantic instance segmentation provides useful, but inherently 2D information from a single image. To enable 3D analysis, one usually integrates absolute monocular depth estimation with instance segmentation. However, monocular depth is a difficult task. Instead, we leverage a simpler single-image task, occlusion-based relative depth ordering, providing coarser but useful 3D information. We show that relative depth ordering works more reliably from occlusions than from absolute depth. We propose to solve the joint task of relative depth ordering and segmentation of instances based on occlusions. We call this task Occlusion-Ordered Semantic Instance Segmentation (OOSIS). We develop an approach to OOSIS that extracts instances and their occlusion order simultaneously from oriented occlusion boundaries and semantic segmentation. Unlike popular detect-and-segment framework for instance segmentation, combining occlusion ordering with instance segmentation allows a simple and clean formulation of OOSIS as a labeling problem. As a part of our solution for OOSIS, we develop a novel oriented occlusion boundaries approach that significantly outperforms prior work. We also develop a new joint OOSIS metric based both on instance mask accuracy and correctness of their occlusion order. We achieve better performance than strong baselines on KINS and COCOA datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CholecInstanceSeg: A Tool Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16039v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In laparoscopic and robotic surgery, precise tool instance segmentation is an essential technology for advanced computer-assisted interventions. Although publicly available procedures of routine surgeries exist, they often lack comprehensive annotations for tool instance segmentation. Additionally, the majority of standard datasets for tool segmentation are derived from porcine(pig) surgeries. To address this gap, we introduce CholecInstanceSeg, the largest open-access tool instance segmentation dataset to date. Derived from the existing CholecT50 and Cholec80 datasets, CholecInstanceSeg provides novel annotations for laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures in patients. Our dataset comprises 41.9k annotated frames extracted from 85 clinical procedures and 64.4k tool instances, each labelled with semantic masks and instance IDs. To ensure the reliability of our annotations, we perform extensive quality control, conduct label agreement statistics, and benchmark the segmentation results with various instance segmentation baselines. CholecInstanceSeg aims to advance the field by offering a comprehensive and high-quality open-access dataset for the development and evaluation of tool instance segmentation algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Single-shot Star-convex Polygon-based Instance Segmentation for Spatially-correlated Biomedical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12078v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical images often contain objects known to be spatially correlated or nested due to their inherent properties, leading to semantic relations. Examples include cell nuclei being nested within eukaryotic cells and colonies growing exclusively within their culture dishes. While these semantic relations bear key importance, detection tasks are often formulated independently, requiring multi-shot analysis pipelines. Importantly, spatial correlation could constitute a fundamental prior facilitating learning of more meaningful representations for tasks like instance segmentation. This knowledge has, thus far, not been utilised by the biomedical computer vision community. We argue that the instance segmentation of two or more categories of objects can be achieved in parallel. We achieve this via two architectures HydraStarDist (HSD) and the novel (HSD-WBR) based on the widely-used StarDist (SD), to take advantage of the star-convexity of our target objects. HSD and HSD-WBR are constructed to be capable of incorporating their interactions as constraints into account. HSD implicitly incorporates spatial correlation priors based on object interaction through a joint encoder. HSD-WBR further enforces the prior in a regularisation layer with the penalty we proposed named Within Boundary Regularisation Penalty (WBR). Both architectures achieve nested instance segmentation in a single shot. We demonstrate their competitiveness based on $IoU_R$ and AP and superiority in a new, task-relevant criteria, Joint TP rate (JTPR) compared to their baseline SD and Cellpose. Our approach can be further modified to capture partial-inclusion/-exclusion in multi-object interactions in fluorescent or brightfield microscopy or digital imaging. Finally, our strategy suggests gains by making this learning single-shot and computationally efficient.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[CAGS: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding with Context-Aware Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11893v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding is crucial for applications requiring natural language-driven spatial interpretation, such as robotics and augmented reality. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a powerful representation for scene reconstruction, integrating it with open-vocabulary frameworks reveals a key challenge: cross-view granularity inconsistency. This issue, stemming from 2D segmentation methods like SAM, results in inconsistent object segmentations across views (e.g., a "coffee set" segmented as a single entity in one view but as "cup + coffee + spoon" in another). Existing 3DGS-based methods often rely on isolated per-Gaussian feature learning, neglecting the spatial context needed for cohesive object reasoning, leading to fragmented representations. We propose Context-Aware Gaussian Splatting (CAGS), a novel framework that addresses this challenge by incorporating spatial context into 3DGS. CAGS constructs local graphs to propagate contextual features across Gaussians, reducing noise from inconsistent granularity, employs mask-centric contrastive learning to smooth SAM-derived features across views, and leverages a precomputation strategy to reduce computational cost by precomputing neighborhood relationships, enabling efficient training in large-scale scenes. By integrating spatial context, CAGS significantly improves 3D instance segmentation and reduces fragmentation errors on datasets like LERF-OVS and ScanNet, enabling robust language-guided 3D scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CAP-Net: A Unified Network for 6D Pose and Size Estimation of Categorical Articulated Parts from a Single RGB-D Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11230v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper tackles category-level pose estimation of articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks and introduces a new benchmark dataset. While recent methods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on geometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from the point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation for 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images, leading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for estimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method combines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS representations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified network to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets, and NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted class based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part. Finally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to recover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we introduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date, featuring photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real sensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Real-world deployments of our model in robotic tasks underscore its robustness and exceptional sim-to-real transfer capabilities, confirming its substantial practical utility. Our dataset, code and pre-trained models are available on the project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> | None |
| **[ContourFormer: Real-Time Contour-Based End-to-End Instance Segmentation Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17688v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Contourformer, a real-time contour-based instance segmentation algorithm. The method is fully based on the DETR paradigm and achieves end-to-end inference through iterative and progressive mechanisms to optimize contours. To improve efficiency and accuracy, we develop two novel techniques: sub-contour decoupling mechanisms and contour fine-grained distribution refinement. In the sub-contour decoupling mechanism, we propose a deformable attention-based module that adaptively selects sampling regions based on the current predicted contour, enabling more effective capturing of object boundary information. Additionally, we design a multi-stage optimization process to enhance segmentation precision by progressively refining sub-contours. The contour fine-grained distribution refinement technique aims to further improve the ability to express fine details of contours. These innovations enable Contourformer to achieve stable and precise segmentation for each instance while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Contourformer on multiple benchmark datasets, including SBD, COCO, and KINS. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and inference speed. This work provides a new solution for contour-based instance segmentation tasks and lays a foundation for future research, with the potential to become a strong baseline method in this field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cut-and-Splat: Leveraging Gaussian Splatting for Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08473v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating synthetic images is a useful method for cheaply obtaining labeled data for training computer vision models. However, obtaining accurate 3D models of relevant objects is necessary, and the resulting images often have a gap in realism due to challenges in simulating lighting effects and camera artifacts. We propose using the novel view synthesis method called Gaussian Splatting to address these challenges. We have developed a synthetic data pipeline for generating high-quality context-aware instance segmentation training data for specific objects. This process is fully automated, requiring only a video of the target object. We train a Gaussian Splatting model of the target object and automatically extract the object from the video. Leveraging Gaussian Splatting, we then render the object on a random background image, and monocular depth estimation is employed to place the object in a believable pose. We introduce a novel dataset to validate our approach and show superior performance over other data generation approaches, such as Cut-and-Paste and Diffusion model-based generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference on Robotics, Computer Vision and Intelligent Systems 2025 (ROBOVIS)</p></details> | None |
| **[P2Object: Single Point Supervised Object Detection and Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07813v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object recognition using single-point supervision has attracted increasing attention recently. However, the performance gap compared with fully-supervised algorithms remains large. Previous works generated class-agnostic \textbf{\textit{proposals in an image}} offline and then treated mixed candidates as a single bag, putting a huge burden on multiple instance learning (MIL). In this paper, we introduce Point-to-Box Network (P2BNet), which constructs balanced \textbf{\textit{instance-level proposal bags}} by generating proposals in an anchor-like way and refining the proposals in a coarse-to-fine paradigm. Through further research, we find that the bag of proposals, either at the image level or the instance level, is established on discrete box sampling. This leads the pseudo box estimation into a sub-optimal solution, resulting in the truncation of object boundaries or the excessive inclusion of background. Hence, we conduct a series exploration of discrete-to-continuous optimization, yielding P2BNet++ and Point-to-Mask Network (P2MNet). P2BNet++ conducts an approximately continuous proposal sampling strategy by better utilizing spatial clues. P2MNet further introduces low-level image information to assist in pixel prediction, and a boundary self-prediction is designed to relieve the limitation of the estimated boxes. Benefiting from the continuous object-aware \textbf{\textit{pixel-level perception}}, P2MNet can generate more precise bounding boxes and generalize to segmentation tasks. Our method largely surpasses the previous methods in terms of the mean average precision on COCO, VOC, SBD, and Cityscapes, demonstrating great potential to bridge the performance gap compared with fully supervised tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV | None |
| **[OoDIS: Anomaly Instance Segmentation and Detection Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11835v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe navigation of self-driving cars and robots requires a precise understanding of their environment. Training data for perception systems cannot cover the wide variety of objects that may appear during deployment. Thus, reliable identification of unknown objects, such as wild animals and untypical obstacles, is critical due to their potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been facilitated by the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. However, a comprehensive understanding of scene dynamics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Development in this area has been lagging, largely due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks. The situation is similar in object detection. While there is interest in detecting and potentially tracking every anomalous object, the availability of dedicated benchmarks is clearly limited. To address this gap, this work extends some commonly used anomaly segmentation benchmarks to include the instance segmentation and object detection tasks. Our evaluation of anomaly instance segmentation and object detection methods shows that both of these challenges remain unsolved problems.

| **[Enhancing Cell Instance Segmentation in Scanning Electron Microscopy Images via a Deep Contour Closing Operator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15817v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately segmenting and individualizing cells in SEM images is a highly promising technique for elucidating tissue architecture in oncology. While current AI-based methods are effective, errors persist, necessitating time-consuming manual corrections, particularly in areas where the quality of cell contours in the image is poor and requires gap filling. This study presents a novel AI-driven approach for refining cell boundary delineation to improve instance-based cell segmentation in SEM images, also reducing the necessity for residual manual correction. A CNN COp-Net is introduced to address gaps in cell contours, effectively filling in regions with deficient or absent information. The network takes as input cell contour probability maps with potentially inadequate or missing information and outputs corrected cell contour delineations. The lack of training data was addressed by generating low integrity probability maps using a tailored PDE. We showcase the efficacy of our approach in augmenting cell boundary precision using both private SEM images from PDX hepatoblastoma tissues and publicly accessible images datasets. The proposed cell contour closing operator exhibits a notable improvement in tested datasets, achieving respectively close to 50% (private data) and 10% (public data) increase in the accurately-delineated cell proportion compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the need for manual corrections was significantly reduced, therefore facilitating the overall digitalization process. Our results demonstrate a notable enhancement in the accuracy of cell instance segmentation, particularly in highly challenging regions where image quality compromises the integrity of cell boundaries, necessitating gap filling. Therefore, our work should ultimately facilitate the study of tumour tissue bioarchitecture in onconanotomy field.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[A2VIS: Amodal-Aware Approach to Video Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01147v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling occlusion remains a significant challenge for video instance-level tasks like Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Amodal-Aware Video Instance Segmentation (A2VIS), which incorporates amodal representations to achieve a reliable and comprehensive understanding of both visible and occluded parts of objects in a video. The key intuition is that awareness of amodal segmentation through spatiotemporal dimension enables a stable stream of object information. In scenarios where objects are partially or completely hidden from view, amodal segmentation offers more consistency and less dramatic changes along the temporal axis compared to visible segmentation. Hence, both amodal and visible information from all clips can be integrated into one global instance prototype. To effectively address the challenge of video amodal segmentation, we introduce the spatiotemporal-prior Amodal Mask Head, which leverages visible information intra clips while extracting amodal characteristics inter clips. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that A2VIS excels in both MOT and VIS tasks in identifying and tracking object instances with a keen understanding of their full shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IMAVIS.

| **[Wheat3DGS: In-field 3D Reconstruction, Instance Segmentation and Phenotyping of Wheat Heads with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06978v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated extraction of plant morphological traits is crucial for supporting crop breeding and agricultural management through high-throughput field phenotyping (HTFP). Solutions based on multi-view RGB images are attractive due to their scalability and affordability, enabling volumetric measurements that 2D approaches cannot directly capture. While advanced methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown promise, their application has been limited to counting or extracting traits from only a few plants or organs. Furthermore, accurately measuring complex structures like individual wheat heads-essential for studying crop yields-remains particularly challenging due to occlusions and the dense arrangement of crop canopies in field conditions. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising alternative for HTFP due to its high-quality reconstructions and explicit point-based representation. In this paper, we present Wheat3DGS, a novel approach that leverages 3DGS and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D instance segmentation and morphological measurement of hundreds of wheat heads automatically, representing the first application of 3DGS to HTFP. We validate the accuracy of wheat head extraction against high-resolution laser scan data, obtaining per-instance mean absolute percentage errors of 15.1%, 18.3%, and 40.2% for length, width, and volume. We provide additional comparisons to NeRF-based approaches and traditional Muti-View Stereo (MVS), demonstrating superior results. Our approach enables rapid, non-destructive measurements of key yield-related traits at scale, with significant implications for accelerating crop breeding and improving our understanding of wheat development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[DCSEG: Decoupled 3D Open-Set Segmentation using Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10972v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-set 3D segmentation represents a major point of interest for multiple downstream robotics and augmented/virtual reality applications. We present a decoupled 3D segmentation pipeline to ensure modularity and adaptability to novel 3D representations as well as semantic segmentation foundation models. We first reconstruct a scene with 3D Gaussians and learn class-agnostic features through contrastive supervision from a 2D instance proposal network. These 3D features are then clustered to form coarse object- or part-level masks. Finally, we match each 3D cluster to class-aware masks predicted by a 2D open-vocabulary segmentation model, assigning semantic labels without retraining the 3D representation. Our decoupled design (1) provides a plug-and-play interface for swapping different 2D or 3D modules, (2) ensures multi-object instance segmentation at no extra cost, and (3) leverages rich 3D geometry for robust scene understanding. We evaluate on synthetic and real-world indoor datasets, demonstrating improved performance over comparable NeRF-based pipelines on mIoU and mAcc, particularly for challenging or long-tail classes. We also show how varying the 2D backbone affects the final segmentation, highlighting the modularity of our framework. These results confirm that decoupling 3D mask proposal and semantic classification can deliver flexible, efficient, and open-vocabulary 3D segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CVPR Workshop on Open-World 3D Scene Understanding with Foundation Models</p></details> | None |
| **[DefMamba: Deformable Visual State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05794v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, state space models (SSM), particularly Mamba, have attracted significant attention from scholars due to their ability to effectively balance computational efficiency and performance. However, most existing visual Mamba methods flatten images into 1D sequences using predefined scan orders, which results the model being less capable of utilizing the spatial structural information of the image during the feature extraction process. To address this issue, we proposed a novel visual foundation model called DefMamba. This model includes a multi-scale backbone structure and deformable mamba (DM) blocks, which dynamically adjust the scanning path to prioritize important information, thus enhancing the capture and processing of relevant input features. By combining a deformable scanning(DS) strategy, this model significantly improves its ability to learn image structures and detects changes in object details. Numerous experiments have shown that DefMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in various visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The code is open source on DefMamba.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |
| **[S^4M: Boosting Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation with SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05301v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised instance segmentation poses challenges due to limited labeled data, causing difficulties in accurately localizing distinct object instances. Current teacher-student frameworks still suffer from performance constraints due to unreliable pseudo-label quality stemming from limited labeled data. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers robust segmentation capabilities at various granularities, directly applying SAM to this task introduces challenges such as class-agnostic predictions and potential over-segmentation. To address these complexities, we carefully integrate SAM into the semi-supervised instance segmentation framework, developing a novel distillation method that effectively captures the precise localization capabilities of SAM without compromising semantic recognition. Furthermore, we incorporate pseudo-label refinement as well as a specialized data augmentation with the refined pseudo-labels, resulting in superior performance. We establish state-of-the-art performance, and provide comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent methods have demonstrated the effectiveness of acquiring high-quality pseudo masks under the teacher-student framework. Building upon this foundation, we propose a BoxSeg framework involving two novel and general modules named the Quality-Aware Module (QAM) and the Peer-assisted Copy-paste (PC). The QAM obtains high-quality pseudo masks and better measures the mask quality to help reduce the effect of noisy masks, by leveraging the quality-aware multi-mask complementation mechanism. The PC imitates Peer-Assisted Learning to further improve the quality of the low-quality masks with the guidance of the obtained high-quality pseudo masks. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the proposed QAM and PC are effective. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our BoxSeg over the state-of-the-art methods, and illustrate the QAM and PC can be applied to improve other models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Prior2Former -- Evidential Modeling of Mask Transformers for Assumption-Free Open-World Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04841v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In panoptic segmentation, individual instances must be separated within semantic classes. As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where reliability in unseen scenarios is essential. We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of P2F. It achieves the highest ranking in the OoDIS anomaly instance benchmark among methods not using OOD data in any way.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Statistical Guarantees Of False Discovery Rate In Medical Instance Segmentation Tasks Based on Conformal Risk Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04482v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation plays a pivotal role in medical image analysis by enabling precise localization and delineation of lesions, tumors, and anatomical structures. Although deep learning models such as Mask R-CNN and BlendMask have achieved remarkable progress, their application in high-risk medical scenarios remains constrained by confidence calibration issues, which may lead to misdiagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose a robust quality control framework based on conformal prediction theory. This framework innovatively constructs a risk-aware dynamic threshold mechanism that adaptively adjusts segmentation decision boundaries according to clinical requirements.Specifically, we design a \textbf{calibration-aware loss function} that dynamically tunes the segmentation threshold based on a user-defined risk level $\alpha$. Utilizing exchangeable calibration data, this method ensures that the expected FNR or FDR on test data remains below $\alpha$ with high probability. The framework maintains compatibility with mainstream segmentation models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, BlendMask+ResNet-50-FPN) and datasets (PASCAL VOC format) without requiring architectural modifications. Empirical results demonstrate that we rigorously bound the FDR metric marginally over the test set via our developed calibration framework.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[iConFormer: Dynamic Parameter-Efficient Tuning with Input-Conditioned Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02838v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning based on full fine-tuning (FFT) of the pre-trained encoder and task-specific decoder becomes increasingly complex as deep models grow exponentially. Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches using adapters consisting of small learnable layers have emerged as an alternative to FFT, achieving comparable performance while maintaining high training efficiency. However, the inflexibility of the adapter with respect to input instances limits its capability of learning task-specific information in diverse downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel PEFT approach, input-Conditioned transFormer, termed iConFormer, that leverages a dynamic adapter conditioned on the input instances. To secure flexible learning ability on input instances in various downstream tasks, we introduce an input-Conditioned Network (iCoN) in the dynamic adapter that enables instance-level feature transformation. To be specific, iCoN generates channel-wise convolutional kernels for each feature and transform it using adaptive convolution process to effectively capture task-specific and fine-grained details tailor to downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that by tuning just 1.6% to 2.8% of the Transformer backbone parameters, iConFormer achieves performance comparable to FFT in monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation, while outperforming it in image classification and instance segmentation. Also, the proposed method consistently outperforms recent PEFT methods for all the tasks mentioned above.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce a comprehensive dataset containing $2,466$ images with newly created polygonal annotations for instance segmentation, used for training and validation. Additionally, we present a novel dataset comprising $17$ drone videos (comprising about $24K$ frames) captured at $30 FPS$, annotated with both polygons for instance segmentation and bounding boxes for object detection, employed for testing purposes. We train various versions of YOLOv8 for instance segmentation on static images and assess their performance on the test dataset (videos). The best results were achieved by the YOLOv8-nano model (runnable on a portable device), with an mAP50 of $88.94%$ on the validation dataset and $81.21%$ macro average on the test dataset. The results provide a baseline for future research in rip current segmentation. Our work contributes to the existing literature by introducing a detailed, annotated dataset, and training a deep learning model for instance segmentation of rip currents.

However, current methods face challenges due to limited dataset sizes, resolution discrepancies, and diverse environmental conditions. We address this by reformulating the task as instance segmentation and introducing the Field Boundary Instance Segmentation - 22M dataset (FBIS-22M), a large-scale, multi-resolution dataset comprising 672,909 high-resolution satellite image patches (ranging from 0.25 m to 10 m) and 22,926,427 instance masks of individual fields, significantly narrowing the gap between agricultural datasets and those in other computer vision domains. We further propose Delineate Anything, an instance segmentation model trained on our new FBIS-22M dataset. Our proposed model sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving a substantial improvement of 88.5% in mAP@0.5 and 103% in mAP@0.5:0.95 over existing methods, while also demonstrating significantly faster inference and strong zero-shot generalization across diverse image resolutions and unseen geographic regions.

| **[RipVIS: Rip Currents Video Instance Segmentation Benchmark for Beach Monitoring and Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01128v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rip currents are strong, localized and narrow currents of water that flow outwards into the sea, causing numerous beach-related injuries and fatalities worldwide. Accurate identification of rip currents remains challenging due to their amorphous nature and the lack of annotated data, which often requires expert knowledge. To address these issues, we present RipVIS, a large-scale video instance segmentation benchmark explicitly designed for rip current segmentation. RipVIS is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets, featuring $184$ videos ($212,328$ frames), of which $150$ videos ($163,528$ frames) are with rip currents, collected from various sources, including drones, mobile phones, and fixed beach cameras. Our dataset encompasses diverse visual contexts, such as wave-breaking patterns, sediment flows, and water color variations, across multiple global locations, including USA, Mexico, Costa Rica, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Romania, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand. Most videos are annotated at $5$ FPS to ensure accuracy in dynamic scenarios, supplemented by an additional $34$ videos ($48,800$ frames) without rip currents. We conduct comprehensive experiments with Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, SparseInst and YOLO11, fine-tuning these models for the task of rip current segmentation. Results are reported in terms of multiple metrics, with a particular focus on the $F_2$ score to prioritize recall and reduce false negatives. To enhance segmentation performance, we introduce a novel post-processing step based on Temporal Confidence Aggregation (TCA). RipVIS aims to set a new standard for rip current segmentation, contributing towards safer beach environments. We offer a benchmark website to share data, models, and results with the research community, encouraging ongoing collaboration and future contributions, at https://ripvis.ai.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Noisy Annotations in Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10891v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining accurate labels for instance segmentation is particularly challenging due to the complex nature of the task. Each image necessitates multiple annotations, encompassing not only the object class but also its precise spatial boundaries. These requirements elevate the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies in both manual and automated annotation processes. By simulating different noise conditions, we provide a realistic scenario for assessing the robustness and generalization capabilities of instance segmentation models in different segmentation tasks, introducing COCO-N and Cityscapes-N. We also propose a benchmark for weakly annotation noise, dubbed COCO-WAN, which utilizes foundation models and weak annotations to simulate semi-automated annotation tools and their noisy labels. This study sheds light on the quality of segmentation masks produced by various models and challenges the efficacy of popular methods designed to address learning with label noise.</p></details> |  | None |

With the advent of the foundational Segment Anything Model (SAM), the accuracy and efficiency of nuclear segmentation have improved significantly. However, SAM imposes a strong reliance on precise prompts, and its class-agnostic design renders its classification results entirely dependent on the provided prompts. Therefore, we focus on generating prompts with more accurate localization and classification and propose \textbf{APSeg}, \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{P}rompt model with acquired and injected knowledge for nuclear instance \textbf{Seg}mentation and classification. APSeg incorporates two knowledge-aware modules: (1) Distribution-Guided Proposal Offset Module (\textbf{DG-POM}), which learns distribution knowledge through density map guided, and (2) Category Knowledge Semantic Injection Module (\textbf{CK-SIM}), which injects morphological knowledge derived from category descriptions. We conducted extensive experiments on the PanNuke and CoNSeP datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Instance Migration Diffusion for Nuclear Instance Segmentation in Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01577v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear instance segmentation plays a vital role in disease diagnosis within digital pathology. However, limited labeled data in pathological images restricts the overall performance of nuclear instance segmentation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation framework Instance Migration Diffusion Model (IM-Diffusion), IM-Diffusion designed to generate more varied pathological images by constructing diverse nuclear layouts and internuclear spatial relationships. In detail, we introduce a Nuclear Migration Module (NMM) which constructs diverse nuclear layouts by simulating the process of nuclear migration. Building on this, we further present an Internuclear-regions Inpainting Module (IIM) to generate diverse internuclear spatial relationships by structure-aware inpainting. On the basis of the above, IM-Diffusion generates more diverse pathological images with different layouts and internuclear spatial relationships, thereby facilitating downstream tasks. Evaluation on the CoNSeP and GLySAC datasets demonstrate that the images generated by IM-Diffusion effectively enhance overall instance segmentation performance. Code will be made public later.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing works have shown that vanilla visual networks are biased toward learning appearance information, \eg texture, to recognize objects. This implicit bias causes the model to fail in detecting novel objects with unseen textures in the open-world setting. To address this challenge, we propose a learning framework, called view-Consistent LeaRning (v-CLR), which aims to enforce the model to learn appearance-invariant representations for robust instance segmentation. In v-CLR, we first introduce additional views for each image, where the texture undergoes significant alterations while preserving the image's underlying structure. We then encourage the model to learn the appearance-invariant representation by enforcing the consistency between object features across different views, for which we obtain class-agnostic object proposals using off-the-shelf unsupervised models that possess strong object-awareness. These proposals enable cross-view object feature matching, greatly reducing the appearance dependency while enhancing the object-awareness. We thoroughly evaluate our method on public benchmarks under both cross-class and cross-dataset settings, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

| **[TraceNet: Segment one thing efficiently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14874v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient single instance segmentation is essential for unlocking features in the mobile imaging applications, such as capture or editing. Existing on-the-fly mobile imaging applications scope the segmentation task to portraits or the salient subject due to the computational constraints. Instance segmentation, despite its recent developments towards efficient networks, is still heavy due to the cost of computation on the entire image to identify all instances. To address this, we propose and formulate a one tap driven single instance segmentation task that segments a single instance selected by a user via a positive tap. This task, in contrast to the broader task of segmenting anything as suggested in the Segment Anything Model \cite{sam}, focuses on efficient segmentation of a single instance specified by the user. To solve this problem, we present TraceNet, which explicitly locates the selected instance by way of receptive field tracing. TraceNet identifies image regions that are related to the user tap and heavy computations are only performed on selected regions of the image. Therefore overall computation cost and memory consumption are reduced during inference. We evaluate the performance of TraceNet on instance IoU average over taps and the proportion of the region that a user tap can fall into for a high-quality single-instance mask. Experimental results on MS-COCO and LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. TraceNet can jointly achieve the efficiency and interactivity, filling in the gap between needs for efficient mobile inference and recent research trend towards multimodal and interactive segmentation models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SuperDec: 3D Scene Decomposition with Superquadric Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00992v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SuperDec, an approach for creating compact 3D scene representations via decomposition into superquadric primitives. While most recent works leverage geometric primitives to obtain photorealistic 3D scene representations, we propose to leverage them to obtain a compact yet expressive representation. We propose to solve the problem locally on individual objects and leverage the capabilities of instance segmentation methods to scale our solution to full 3D scenes. In doing that, we design a new architecture which efficiently decompose point clouds of arbitrary objects in a compact set of superquadrics. We train our architecture on ShapeNet and we prove its generalization capabilities on object instances extracted from the ScanNet++ dataset as well as on full Replica scenes. Finally, we show how a compact representation based on superquadrics can be useful for a diverse range of downstream applications, including robotic tasks and controllable visual content generation and editing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CellVTA: Enhancing Vision Foundation Models for Accurate Cell Segmentation and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00784v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell instance segmentation is a fundamental task in digital pathology with broad clinical applications. Recently, vision foundation models, which are predominantly based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), have achieved remarkable success in pathology image analysis. However, their improvements in cell instance segmentation remain limited. A key challenge arises from the tokenization process in ViTs, which substantially reduces the spatial resolution of input images, leading to suboptimal segmentation quality, especially for small and densely packed cells. To address this problem, we propose CellVTA (Cell Vision Transformer with Adapter), a novel method that improves the performance of vision foundation models for cell instance segmentation by incorporating a CNN-based adapter module. This adapter extracts high-resolution spatial information from input images and injects it into the ViT through a cross-attention mechanism. Our method preserves the core architecture of ViT, ensuring seamless integration with pretrained foundation models. Extensive experiments show that CellVTA achieves 0.538 mPQ on the CoNIC dataset and 0.506 mPQ on the PanNuke dataset, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art cell segmentation methods. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our approach over other fine-tuning strategies, including decoder-only fine-tuning and full fine-tuning.

| **[VFX Creator: Animated Visual Effect Generation with Controllable Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05979v4)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crafting magic and illusions is one of the most thrilling aspects of filmmaking, with visual effects (VFX) serving as the powerhouse behind unforgettable cinematic experiences. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have driven progress in generic image and video synthesis, the domain of controllable VFX generation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for animated VFX generation as image animation, where dynamic effects are generated from user-friendly textual descriptions and static reference images. Our work makes two primary contributions: (i) Open-VFX, the first high-quality VFX video dataset spanning 15 diverse effect categories, annotated with textual descriptions, instance segmentation masks for spatial conditioning, and start-end timestamps for temporal control. (ii) VFX Creator, a simple yet effective controllable VFX generation framework based on a Video Diffusion Transformer. The model incorporates a spatial and temporal controllable LoRA adapter, requiring minimal training videos. Specifically, a plug-and-play mask control module enables instance-level spatial manipulation, while tokenized start-end motion timestamps embedded in the diffusion process, alongside the text encoder, allow precise temporal control over effect timing and pace. Extensive experiments on the Open-VFX test set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in generating realistic and dynamic effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance and generalization ability in both spatial and temporal controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized metric to evaluate the precision of temporal control. By bridging traditional VFX techniques with generative approaches, VFX Creator unlocks new possibilities for efficient and high-quality video effect generation, making advanced VFX accessible to a broader audience.</p></details> |  | None |

By means of 3D point cloud, this modality enables to consider the actual size and spatial understanding. The applied fields include mechanical control of robots, vehicles, or other real-world systems. Along this line, we would like to improve 3D point cloud instance segmentation which has emerged as a particularly promising approach for these applications. However, the creation of 3D point cloud datasets entails enormous costs compared to 2D image datasets. To train a model of 3D point cloud instance segmentation, it is necessary not only to assign categories but also to provide detailed annotations for each point in the large-scale 3D space. Meanwhile, the increase of recent proposals for generative models in 3D domain has spurred proposals for using a generative model to create 3D point cloud data. In this work, we propose a pre-training with 3D synthetic data to train a 3D point cloud instance segmentation model based on generative model for 3D scenes represented by point cloud data. We directly generate 3D point cloud data with Point-E for inserting a generated data into a 3D scene. More recently in 2025, although there are other accurate 3D generation models, even using the Point-E as an early 3D generative model can effectively support the pre-training with 3D synthetic data. In the experimental section, we compare our pre-training method with baseline methods indicated improved performance, demonstrating the efficacy of 3D generative models for 3D point cloud instance segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OnlineAnySeg: Online Zero-Shot 3D Segmentation by Visual Foundation Model Guided 2D Mask Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01309v3)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online zero-shot 3D instance segmentation of a progressively reconstructed scene is both a critical and challenging task for embodied applications. With the success of visual foundation models (VFMs) in the image domain, leveraging 2D priors to address 3D online segmentation has become a prominent research focus. Since segmentation results provided by 2D priors often require spatial consistency to be lifted into final 3D segmentation, an efficient method for identifying spatial overlap among 2D masks is essential - yet existing methods rarely achieve this in real time, mainly limiting its use to offline approaches. To address this, we propose an efficient method that lifts 2D masks generated by VFMs into a unified 3D instance using a hashing technique. By employing voxel hashing for efficient 3D scene querying, our approach reduces the time complexity of costly spatial overlap queries from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. Accurate spatial associations further enable 3D merging of 2D masks through simple similarity-based filtering in a zero-shot manner, making our approach more robust to incomplete and noisy data. Evaluated on the ScanNet and SceneNN benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in online, zero-shot 3D instance segmentation with leading efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SmartEraser: Remove Anything from Images using Masked-Region Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08279v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object removal has so far been dominated by the mask-and-inpaint paradigm, where the masked region is excluded from the input, leaving models relying on unmasked areas to inpaint the missing region. However, this approach lacks contextual information for the masked area, often resulting in unstable performance. In this work, we introduce SmartEraser, built with a new removing paradigm called Masked-Region Guidance. This paradigm retains the masked region in the input, using it as guidance for the removal process. It offers several distinct advantages: (a) it guides the model to accurately identify the object to be removed, preventing its regeneration in the output; (b) since the user mask often extends beyond the object itself, it aids in preserving the surrounding context in the final result. Leveraging this new paradigm, we present Syn4Removal, a large-scale object removal dataset, where instance segmentation data is used to copy and paste objects onto images as removal targets, with the original images serving as ground truths. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartEraser significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in object removal, especially in complex scenes with intricate compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project at: https://longtaojiang.github.io/smarteraser.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://longtaojiang.github.io/smarteraser.github.io) |

However, purely SSM-based models face critical challenges related to stability and achieving state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks. Our paper addresses the challenges of scaling SSM-based models for computer vision, particularly the instability and inefficiency of large model sizes. We introduce a parameter-efficient modulated group mamba layer that divides the input channels into four groups and applies our proposed SSM-based efficient Visual Single Selective Scanning (VSSS) block independently to each group, with each VSSS block scanning in one of the four spatial directions. The Modulated Group Mamba layer also wraps the four VSSS blocks into a channel modulation operator to improve cross-channel communication. Furthermore, we introduce a distillation-based training objective to stabilize the training of large models, leading to consistent performance gains. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the merits of the proposed contributions, leading to superior performance over existing methods for image classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection, instance segmentation on MS-COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our tiny variant with 23M parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance with a classification top-1 accuracy of 83.3% on ImageNet-1K, while being 26% efficient in terms of parameters, compared to the best existing Mamba design of same model size.

| **[Benchmarking the Robustness of Instance Segmentation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01123v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of instance segmentation models with respect to real-world image corruptions as well as out-of-domain image collections, e.g. images captured by a different set-up than the training dataset. The out-of-domain image evaluation shows the generalization capability of models, an essential aspect of real-world applications and an extensively studied topic of domain adaptation. These presented robustness and generalization evaluations are important when designing instance segmentation models for real-world applications and picking an off-the-shelf pretrained model to directly use for the task at hand. Specifically, this benchmark study includes state-of-the-art network architectures, network backbones, normalization layers, models trained starting from scratch versus pretrained networks, and the effect of multi-task training on robustness and generalization. Through this study, we gain several insights. For example, we find that group normalization enhances the robustness of networks across corruptions where the image contents stay the same but corruptions are added on top. On the other hand, batch normalization improves the generalization of the models across different datasets where statistics of image features change. We also find that single-stage detectors do not generalize well to larger image resolutions than their training size. On the other hand, multi-stage detectors can easily be used on images of different sizes. We hope that our comprehensive study will motivate the development of more robust and reliable instance segmentation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, they are limited to reasoning within a specific set of concepts, \ie the vocabulary, prompted by the user at test time. In essence, these models cannot reason in an open-ended fashion, i.e., answering "List the objects in the scene.''. We introduce the first method to address 3D instance segmentation in a setting that is void of any vocabulary prior, namely a vocabulary-free setting. We leverage a large vision-language assistant and an open-vocabulary 2D instance segmenter to discover and ground semantic categories on the posed images. To form 3D instance mask, we first partition the input point cloud into dense superpoints, which are then merged into 3D instance masks. We propose a novel superpoint merging strategy via spectral clustering, accounting for both mask coherence and semantic coherence that are estimated from the 2D object instance masks. We evaluate our method using ScanNet200 and Replica, outperforming existing methods in both vocabulary-free and open-vocabulary settings. Code will be made available.

| **[Foveated Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21854v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation is essential for augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) as it enables precise object recognition and interaction, enhancing the integration of virtual and real-world elements for an immersive experience. However, the high computational overhead of segmentation limits its application on resource-constrained AR/VR devices, causing large processing latency and degrading user experience. In contrast to conventional scenarios, AR/VR users typically focus on only a few regions within their field of view before shifting perspective, allowing segmentation to be concentrated on gaze-specific areas. This insight drives the need for efficient segmentation methods that prioritize processing instance of interest, reducing computational load and enhancing real-time performance. In this paper, we present a foveated instance segmentation (FovealSeg) framework that leverages real-time user gaze data to perform instance segmentation exclusively on instance of interest, resulting in substantial computational savings. Evaluation results show that FSNet achieves an IoU of 0.56 on ADE20K and 0.54 on LVIS, notably outperforming the baseline. The code is available at https://github.com/SAI-</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Complementary Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Dense Image Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13174v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been revealed that small efficient dense image prediction (EDIP) models, trained using the knowledge distillation (KD) framework, encounter two key challenges, including maintaining boundary region completeness and preserving target region connectivity, despite their favorable capacity to recognize main object regions. In this work, we propose a complementary boundary and context distillation (BCD) method within the KD framework for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted knowledge transfer from large accurate teacher models to compact efficient student models. Specifically, the boundary distillation component focuses on extracting explicit object-level semantic boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps of the backbone network to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Concurrently, the context distillation component leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions. Our proposed BCD method is specifically designed for EDIP tasks and is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Extensive experimental results across semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on various representative datasets demonstrate that our method can outperform existing methods without requiring extra supervisions or incurring increased inference costs, resulting in well-defined object boundaries and smooth connecting regions.</p></details> | under submission | None |

However, due to the nature of the supervisory signal in these paradigms, they lack the ability to learn localized features, leading to degraded performance on dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods have shown the ability to learn granular representations, complementing the high-level features in vision-language training. In this work, we present Harmony, a framework that combines vision-language training with discriminative and generative self-supervision to learn visual features that can be generalized across different vision downstream tasks. Our framework is specifically designed to work on web-scraped data by not relying on negative examples and addressing the one-to-one correspondence issue using soft CLIP targets generated by an EMA model. We comprehensively evaluate Harmony across various vision downstream tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline CLIP and the previously leading joint self and weakly-supervised methods, MaskCLIP and SLIP. Specifically, when comparing against these methods, Harmony shows superior performance in fine-tuning and zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, and both object detection and instance segmentation on MS-COCO, when pre-training a ViT-B on CC3M.

Current monitoring methods involve measuring trees by hand for each species, requiring extensive cost, time, and labour. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping and characterizing trees from aerial imagery, and large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), may be a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare SAM methods for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery of young tree plantations. We explore the potential of SAM for this task, and find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts, but that there is potential for methods which tune SAM further.

However, current method primarily focus on object-centric representations, supporting object segmentation or detection, while understanding semantic relationships between objects remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose RelationField, the first method to extract inter-object relationships directly from neural radiance fields. RelationField represents relationships between objects as pairs of rays within a neural radiance field, effectively extending its formulation to include implicit relationship queries. To teach RelationField complex, open-vocabulary relationships, relationship knowledge is distilled from multi-modal LLMs. To evaluate RelationField, we solve open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation tasks and relationship-guided instance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks.

| **[CKD: Contrastive Knowledge Distillation from A Sample-wise Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14109v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective contrastive knowledge distillation framework that achieves sample-wise logit alignment while preserving semantic consistency. Conventional knowledge distillation approaches exhibit over-reliance on feature similarity per sample, which risks overfitting, and contrastive approaches focus on inter-class discrimination at the expense of intra-sample semantic relationships. Our approach transfers "dark knowledge" through teacher-student contrastive alignment at the sample level. Specifically, our method first enforces intra-sample alignment by directly minimizing teacher-student logit discrepancies within individual samples. Then, we utilize inter-sample contrasts to preserve semantic dissimilarities across samples. By redefining positive pairs as aligned teacher-student logits from identical samples and negative pairs as cross-sample logit combinations, we reformulate these dual constraints into an InfoNCE loss framework, reducing computational complexity lower than sample squares while eliminating dependencies on temperature parameters and large batch sizes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across three benchmark datasets, including the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and MS COCO datasets, and experimental results clearly confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiscale Feature Importance-based Bit Allocation for End-to-End Feature Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19278v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) aims to compress intermediate features effectively for remote intelligent analytics, which is crucial for future intelligent visual applications. In this paper, we propose a Multiscale Feature Importance-based Bit Allocation (MFIBA) for end-to-end FCM. First, we find that the importance of features for machine vision tasks varies with the scales, object size, and image instances. Based on this finding, we propose a Multiscale Feature Importance Prediction (MFIP) module to predict the importance weight for each scale of features. Secondly, we propose a task loss-rate model to establish the relationship between the task accuracy losses of using compressed features and the bitrate of encoding these features. Finally, we develop a MFIBA for end-to-end FCM, which is able to assign coding bits of multiscale features more reasonably based on their importance. Experimental results demonstrate that when combined with a retained Efficient Learned Image Compression (ELIC), the proposed MFIBA achieves an average of 38.202% bitrate savings in object detection compared to the anchor ELIC. Moreover, the proposed MFIBA achieves an average of 17.212% and 36.492% feature bitrate savings for instance segmentation and keypoint detection, respectively. When the proposed MFIBA is applied to the LIC-TCM, it achieves an average of 18.103%, 19.866% and 19.597% bit rate savings on three machine vision tasks, respectively, which validates the proposed MFIBA has good generalizability and adaptability to different machine vision tasks and FCM base codecs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NextStop: An Improved Tracker For Panoptic LIDAR Segmentation Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06235v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D panoptic LiDAR segmentation is essential for scene understanding in autonomous driving and robotics, combining semantic and instance segmentation with temporal consistency. Current methods, like 4D-PLS and 4D-STOP, use a tracking-by-detection methodology, employing deep learning networks to perform semantic and instance segmentation on each frame. To maintain temporal consistency, large-size instances detected in the current frame are compared and associated with instances within a temporal window that includes the current and preceding frames. However, their reliance on short-term instance detection, lack of motion estimation, and exclusion of small-sized instances lead to frequent identity switches and reduced tracking performance. We address these issues with the NextStop1 tracker, which integrates Kalman filter-based motion estimation, data association, and lifespan management, along with a tracklet state concept to improve prioritization. Evaluated using the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric on the SemanticKITTI validation set, NextStop demonstrated enhanced tracking performance, particularly for small-sized objects like people and bicyclists, with fewer ID switches, earlier tracking initiation, and improved reliability in complex environments.

A detailed, pixel-level understanding of hands and surgical tools is crucial for interpreting a surgeon's actions and intentions. We introduce EgoSurgery-HTS, a new dataset with pixel-wise annotations and a benchmark suite for segmenting surgical tools, hands, and interacting tools in egocentric open-surgery videos.

However, despite their potential, these models often overlook the crucial role of high-resolution digital surface models (DSMs) in understanding urban environments, particularly for building-level analysis, which is essential for applications like digital twins. To address this gap, we introduce HiRes-FusedMIM, a novel pre-trained model specifically designed to leverage the rich information contained within high-resolution RGB and DSM data. HiRes-FusedMIM utilizes a dual-encoder simple masked image modeling (SimMIM) architecture with a multi-objective loss function that combines reconstruction and contrastive objectives, enabling it to learn powerful, joint representations from both modalities. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of HiRes-FusedMIM on a diverse set of downstream tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Our results demonstrate that: 1) HiRes-FusedMIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art geospatial methods on several building-related datasets, including WHU Aerial and LoveDA, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing and leveraging fine-grained building information; 2) Incorporating DSMs during pre-training consistently improves performance compared to using RGB data alone, highlighting the value of elevation information for building-level analysis; 3) The dual-encoder architecture of HiRes-FusedMIM, with separate encoders for RGB and DSM data, significantly outperforms a single-encoder model on the Vaihingen segmentation task, indicating the benefits of learning specialized representations for each modality. To facilitate further research and applications in this direction, we will publicly release the trained model weights.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies tackle this problem by developing re-weighting and re-sampling methods, that utilise the class frequencies of the dataset. However, these techniques focus solely on the frequency statistics and ignore the distribution of the classes in image space, missing important information. In contrast to them, we propose FRActal CALibration (FRACAL): a novel post-calibration method for long-tailed object detection. FRACAL devises a logit adjustment method that utilises the fractal dimension to estimate how uniformly classes are distributed in image space. During inference, it uses the fractal dimension to inversely downweight the probabilities of uniformly spaced class predictions achieving balance in two axes: between frequent and rare categories, and between uniformly spaced and sparsely spaced classes. FRACAL is a post-processing method and it does not require any training, also it can be combined with many off-the-shelf models such as one-stage sigmoid detectors and two-stage instance segmentation models. FRACAL boosts the rare class performance by up to 8.6% and surpasses all previous methods on LVIS dataset, while showing good generalisation to other datasets such as COCO, V3Det and OpenImages.

Among these, generative self-supervised vision learning approaches such as MAE and BEiT show promising performance. However, their global masked reconstruction mechanism is computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose local masked reconstruction (LoMaR), a simple yet effective approach that performs masked reconstruction within a small window of 7$\times$7 patches on a simple Transformer encoder, improving the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy compared to global masked reconstruction over the entire image. Extensive experiments show that LoMaR reaches 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming MAE by 0.5%. After finetuning the pretrained LoMaR on 384$\times$384 images, it can reach 85.4% top-1 accuracy, surpassing MAE by 0.6%. On MS COCO, LoMaR outperforms MAE by 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{box}$ on object detection and 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{mask}$ on instance segmentation. LoMaR is especially more computation-efficient on pretraining high-resolution images, e.g., it is 3.1$\times$ faster than MAE with 0.2% higher classification accuracy on pretraining 448$\times$448 images. This local masked reconstruction learning mechanism can be easily integrated into any other generative self-supervised learning approach.

However, the lack of temporal knowledge in the pre-trained model introduces a domain gap which may adversely affect the VIS performance. To effectively bridge this gap, we present a novel video pre-training approach to enhance VIS models, especially for videos with intricate instance relationships. Our crucial innovation focuses on reducing disparities between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Specifically, we first introduce consistent pseudo-video augmentations to create diverse pseudo-video samples for pre-training while maintaining the instance consistency across frames. Then, we incorporate a multi-scale temporal module to enhance the model's ability to model temporal relations through self- and cross-attention at short- and long-term temporal spans. Our approach does not set constraints on model architecture and can integrate seamlessly with various VIS methods. Experiment results on commonly adopted VIS benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a notable 4.0% increase in average precision on the challenging OVIS dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5figures, 6 tables, Accepted to ICME 2025</p></details> | None |

This conventional approach, however, overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both the encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon: a framework-agnostic adaptation to convert an encoder-only self-supervised learning (SSL) contrastive approach to an efficient encoder-decoder framework that can be pre-trained in a contrastive manner. We first update the existing architecture to accommodate a decoder and its respective contrastive loss. We then introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives that facilitates the joint encoder-decoder architecture pre-training. We adapt two established contrastive SSL frameworks tailored for dense prediction tasks, achieve new state-of-the-art results in COCO object detection and instance segmentation, and match state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. We show that our approach allows for pre-training a decoder and enhances the representation power of the encoder and its performance in dense prediction tasks. This benefit holds across heterogeneous decoder architectures between pre-training and fine-tuning and persists in out-of-domain, limited-data scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

It is important for energy and cost-efficient operation of industrial crane manipulators, such as those used to collect tree logs from the forest floor and on forest machines. In this work, we used synthetic data from physics simulations to explore how data-driven modeling can be used to infer multi-object grasp poses from images. We showed that convolutional neural networks can be trained specifically for synthesizing multi-object grasps. Using RGB-Depth images and instance segmentation masks as input, a U-Net model outputs grasp maps with the corresponding grapple orientation and opening width. Given an observation of a pile of logs, the model can be used to synthesize and rate the possible grasp poses and select the most suitable one, with the possibility to respect changing operational constraints such as lift capacity and reach. When tested on previously unseen data, the proposed model found successful grasp poses with an accuracy up to 96%.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures | None |

However, the current implementation of UDC causes serious degradation. The incident light required for camera imaging undergoes attenuation and diffraction when passing through the display panel, leading to various artifacts in UDC imaging. Presently, the prevailing UDC image restoration methods predominantly utilize convolutional neural network architectures, whereas Transformer-based methods have exhibited superior performance in the majority of image restoration tasks. This is attributed to the Transformer's capability to sample global features for the local reconstruction of images, thereby achieving high-quality image restoration. In this paper, we observe that when using the Vision Transformer for UDC degraded image restoration, the global attention samples a large amount of redundant information and noise. Furthermore, compared to the ordinary Transformer employing dense attention, the Transformer utilizing sparse attention can alleviate the adverse impact of redundant information and noise. Building upon this discovery, we propose a Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer method (SGSFormer) for the task of restoring high-quality images from UDC degraded images. Specifically, we utilize sparse self-attention to filter out redundant information and noise, directing the model's attention to focus on the features more relevant to the degraded regions in need of reconstruction. Moreover, we integrate the instance segmentation map as prior information to guide the sparse self-attention in filtering and focusing on the correct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> | None |

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) show remarkable performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, very few have been proposed for instance segmentation in vision-based autonomous driving. Moreover, existing methods rely on suboptimal baselines, which severely limits performance. We introduce \textbf{UDA4Inst}, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through \textit{Semantic Category Training} and \textit{Bidirectional Mixing Training}. With the Semantic Category Training method, semantically related classes are grouped and trained separately, enabling the generation of higher-quality pseudo-labels and improved segmentation performance. We further propose a bidirectional cross-domain data mixing strategy that combines instance-wise and patch-wise mixing techniques to effectively utilize data from both source and target domains, producing realistic composite images that improve the model's generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes benchmark with mAP 31.3. Notably, we are the first to report results on multiple novel synth-to-real instance segmentation datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as source domains while Cityscapes and KITTI360 serve as target domains.

However, traditional methods often treat them as separate tasks, leading to suboptimal performance, spatio-temporal inconsistencies, and inefficiency in complex scenarios due to the absence of information sharing. This paper proposes a multi-task SemanticFlow framework to simultaneously predict scene flow and instance segmentation of full-resolution point clouds. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a coarse-to-fine prediction based multi-task scheme, where an initial coarse segmentation of static backgrounds and dynamic objects is used to provide contextual information for refining motion and semantic information through a shared feature processing module; 2) developing a set of loss functions to enhance the performance of scene flow estimation and instance segmentation, while can help ensure spatial and temporal consistency of both static and dynamic objects within traffic scenes; 3) developing a self-supervised learning scheme, which utilizes coarse segmentation to detect rigid objects and compute their transformation matrices between sequential frames, enabling the generation of self-supervised labels. The proposed framework is validated on the Argoverse and Waymo datasets, demonstrating superior performance in instance segmentation accuracy, scene flow estimation, and computational efficiency, establishing a new benchmark for self-supervised methods in dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

We utilize VLM-generated structured descriptions to identify visible object instances, collect application-relevant attributes, and inform an open-vocabulary detector to extract corresponding bounding boxes that are passed to a video segmentation model providing precise segmentation masks and tracking capabilities. Once initialized, this model can then directly extract segmentation masks, allowing processing of image streams in real time with minimal computational overhead. Tracks can be updated online as needed by generating new structured descriptions and corresponding open-vocabulary detections. This combines the descriptive power of VLMs with the grounding capability of OVD and the pixel-level understanding and speed of video segmentation.

Existing methods rely on direct matching for end-to-end lifting, yielding inferior results; or employ a two-stage solution constrained by complex pre- or post-processing. In this work, we design a new end-to-end object-aware lifting approach, named Unified-Lift that provides accurate 3D segmentation based on the 3D Gaussian representation. To start, we augment each Gaussian point with an additional Gaussian-level feature learned using a contrastive loss to encode instance information. Importantly, we introduce a learnable object-level codebook to account for individual objects in the scene for an explicit object-level understanding and associate the encoded object-level features with the Gaussian-level point features for segmentation predictions. While promising, achieving effective codebook learning is non-trivial and a naive solution leads to degraded performance. Therefore, we formulate the association learning module and the noisy label filtering module for effective and robust codebook learning. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks: LERF-Masked, Replica, and Messy Rooms datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative results manifest that our Unified-Lift clearly outperforms existing methods in terms of segmentation quality and time efficiency.

Robots can help to automate this process. To do so, they need to be able to perceive the surrounding environment to identify target objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address the problem of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of apple orchards on 3D data from different sensors. Our approach is able to simultaneously provide semantic segmentation, instance segmentation of trunks and fruits, and instance segmentation of plants (a single trunk with its fruits). This allows us to identify relevant information such as individual plants, fruits, and trunks, and capture the relationship among them, such as precisely estimate the number of fruits associated to each tree in an orchard. Additionally, to efficiently evaluate our approach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, we provide a dataset designed specifically for this task. Our dataset is recorded in Bonn in a real apple orchard with a variety of sensors, spanning from a terrestrial laser scanner to a RGB-D camera mounted on different robotic platforms. The experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in 3D panoptic segmentation in the agricultural domain, while also providing full hierarchical panoptic segmentation.

However, it requires laborious human efforts to annotate the point cloud for training a segmentation model. To address this challenge, we propose a YoCo framework, which generates 3D pseudo labels using minimal coarse click annotations in the bird's eye view plane. It is a significant challenge to produce high-quality pseudo labels from sparse annotations. Our YoCo framework first leverages vision foundation models combined with geometric constraints from point clouds to enhance pseudo label generation. Second, a temporal and spatial-based label updating module is designed to generate reliable updated labels. It leverages predictions from adjacent frames and utilizes the inherent density variation of point clouds (dense near, sparse far). Finally, to further improve label quality, an IoU-guided enhancement module is proposed, replacing pseudo labels with high-confidence and high-IoU predictions. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate YoCo's effectiveness and generality, achieving state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised methods and surpassing fully supervised Cylinder3D. Additionally, the YoCo is suitable for various networks, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised methods with minimal fine-tuning using only 0.8% of the fully labeled data, significantly reducing annotation costs.</p></details> |  | None |

Generative models (GANs, diffusion models) have been used to compensate for this by synthesizing training data. These two-stage approaches are computationally expensive, as first a generative model and then a segmentation model has to be trained. We propose CyclePose, a hybrid framework integrating synthetic data generation and segmentation training. CyclePose builds on a CycleGAN architecture, which allows unpaired translation between microscopy images and segmentation masks.

Despite considerable progress in removing hand-crafted components and simplifying the architecture with transformers, multi-scale feature maps and pyramid designs remain a key factor for their empirical success. In this paper, we show that shifting the multiscale inductive bias into the attention mechanism can work well, resulting in a plain detector `SimPLR' whose backbone and detection head are both non-hierarchical and operate on single-scale features. We find through our experiments that SimPLR with scale-aware attention is plain and simple architecture, yet competitive with multi-scale vision transformer alternatives. Compared to the multi-scale and single-scale state-of-the-art, our model scales better with bigger capacity (self-supervised) models and more pre-training data, allowing us to report a consistently better accuracy and faster runtime for object detection, instance segmentation, as well as panoptic segmentation.

Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach, SAS, to integrate the open vocabulary capability of multiple 2D models and migrate it to 3D domain. Specifically, we first propose Model Alignment via Text to map different 2D models into the same embedding space using text as a bridge. Then, we propose Annotation-Free Model Capability Construction to explicitly quantify the 2D model's capability of recognizing different categories using diffusion models. Following this, point cloud features from different 2D models are fused with the guide of constructed model capabilities. Finally, the integrated 2D open vocabulary capability is transferred to 3D domain through feature distillation. SAS outperforms previous methods by a large margin across multiple datasets, including ScanNet v2, Matterport3D, and nuScenes, while its generalizability is further validated on downstream tasks, e.g., gaussian segmentation and instance segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing models still face challenges in automatically segmenting personalized instances in dense scenarios, where severe occlusions, scale variations, and background clutter hinder precise instance delineation. To address this, we propose PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot framework for personalized instance segmentation in dense images. We start with developing a new baseline capable of automatically generating instance-level point prompts via proposing a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps, encapsulating spatial distribution of objects in an image. To reduce false positives, we design the Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM), which refines the output of IDM based on an adaptive threshold. Both IDM and PPSM seamlessly integrate into our model-agnostic framework. Furthermore, we introduce a feedback mechanism which enables PerSense to improve the accuracy of density maps by automating the exemplar selection process for density map generation. Finally, to promote algorithmic advances and effective tools for this relatively underexplored task, we introduce PerSense-D, an evaluation benchmark exclusive to personalized instance segmentation in dense images. Our extensive experiments establish PerSense superiority in dense scenarios compared to SOTA approaches. Additionally, our qualitative findings demonstrate the adaptability of our framework to images captured in-the-wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report of PerSense</p></details> | None |
| **[DiffEGG: Diffusion-Driven Edge Generation as a Pixel-Annotation-Free Alternative for Instance Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07982v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise panoptic segmentation relies on pixel-wise instance annotations, but obtaining such datasets is costly. Unsupervised instance segmentation (UIS) eliminates annotation requirements but struggles with adjacent instance merging and single-instance fragmentation, largely due to the limitations of DINO-based backbones which lack strong instance separation cues. Weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation (WPS) reduces annotation costs using sparse labels (e.g., points, boxes), yet these annotations remain expensive and introduce human bias and boundary errors. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEGG (Diffusion-Driven EdGe Generation), a fully annotation-free method that extracts instance-aware features from pretrained diffusion models to generate precise instance edge maps. Unlike DINO-based UIS methods, diffusion models inherently capture fine-grained, instance-aware features, enabling more precise boundary delineation. For WPS, DiffEGG eliminates annotation costs and human bias by operating without any form of manual supervision, addressing the key limitations of prior best methods. Additionally, we introduce RIP, a post-processing technique that fuses DiffEGG's edge maps with segmentation masks in a task-agnostic manner. RIP allows DiffEGG to be seamlessly integrated into various segmentation frameworks. When applied to UIS, DiffEGG and RIP achieve an average $+4.4\text{ AP}$ improvement over prior best UIS methods. When combined with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSS), DiffEGG enables WPS without instance annotations, outperforming prior best point-supervised WPS methods by $+1.7\text{ PQ}$. These results demonstrate that DiffEGG's edge maps serve as a cost-effective, annotation-free alternative to instance annotations, significantly improving segmentation without human intervention.

| **[Aligning Instance-Semantic Sparse Representation towards Unsupervised Object Segmentation and Shape Abstraction with Repeatable Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06947v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D object shapes necessitates shape representation by object parts abstracted from results of instance and semantic segmentation. Promising shape representations enable computers to interpret a shape with meaningful parts and identify their repeatability. However, supervised shape representations depend on costly annotation efforts, while current unsupervised methods work under strong semantic priors and involve multi-stage training, thereby limiting their generalization and deployment in shape reasoning and understanding. Driven by the tendency of high-dimensional semantically similar features to lie in or near low-dimensional subspaces, we introduce a one-stage, fully unsupervised framework towards semantic-aware shape representation. This framework produces joint instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and shape abstraction through sparse representation and feature alignment of object parts in a high-dimensional space. For sparse representation, we devise a sparse latent membership pursuit method that models each object part feature as a sparse convex combination of point features at either the semantic or instance level, promoting part features in the same subspace to exhibit similar semantics. For feature alignment, we customize an attention-based strategy in the feature space to align instance- and semantic-level object part features and reconstruct the input shape using both of them, ensuring geometric reusability and semantic consistency of object parts. To firm up semantic disambiguation, we construct cascade unfrozen learning on geometric parameters of object parts.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 15 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[SAQ-SAM: Semantically-Aligned Quantization for Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06515v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot segmentation capability; however, its prohibitive computational costs make edge deployment challenging. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) offers a promising compression solution, existing methods yield unsatisfactory results when applied to SAM, owing to its specialized model components and promptable workflow: (i) The mask decoder's attention exhibits extreme outliers, and we find that aggressive clipping (ranging down to even 100$\times$), instead of smoothing or isolation, is effective in suppressing outliers while maintaining semantic capabilities. Unfortunately, traditional metrics (e.g., MSE) fail to provide such large-scale clipping. (ii) Existing reconstruction methods potentially neglect prompts' intention, resulting in distorted visual encodings during prompt interactions. To address the above issues, we propose SAQ-SAM in this paper, which boosts PTQ of SAM with semantic alignment. Specifically, we propose Perceptual-Consistency Clipping, which exploits attention focus overlap as clipping metric, to significantly suppress outliers. Furthermore, we propose Prompt-Aware Reconstruction, which incorporates visual-prompt interactions by leveraging cross-attention responses in mask decoder, thus facilitating alignment in both distribution and semantics. To ensure the interaction efficiency, we also introduce a layer-skipping strategy for visual tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted on different segmentation tasks and SAMs of various sizes, and the results show that the proposed SAQ-SAM consistently outperforms baselines. For example, when quantizing SAM-B to 4-bit, our method achieves 11.7% higher mAP than the baseline in instance segmentation task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Segment Anything, Even Occluded](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06261v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amodal instance segmentation, which aims to detect and segment both visible and invisible parts of objects in images, plays a crucial role in various applications including autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene understanding. While existing methods require training both front-end detectors and mask decoders jointly, this approach lacks flexibility and fails to leverage the strengths of pre-existing modal detectors. To address this limitation, we propose SAMEO, a novel framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a versatile mask decoder capable of interfacing with various front-end detectors to enable mask prediction even for partially occluded objects. Acknowledging the constraints of limited amodal segmentation datasets, we introduce Amodal-LVIS, a large-scale synthetic dataset comprising 300K images derived from the modal LVIS and LVVIS datasets. This dataset significantly expands the training data available for amodal segmentation research. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach, when trained on the newly extended dataset, including Amodal-LVIS, achieves remarkable zero-shot performance on both COCOA-cls and D2SA benchmarks, highlighting its potential for generalization to unseen scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurate and efficient joint segmentation of point cloud from Panel to Tree and Branch (P2TB) is essential for robotic operations. However, most current segmentation methods focus on single instance segmentation and depend on a sequence of deep networks to perform joint tasks. This strategy hinders the use of hierarchical information embedded in the data, leading to both error accumulation and increased costs for annotation and computation, which limits its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we proposed a novel approach that incorporated a Real2Sim L-TreeGen for training data generation and a joint model (J-P2TB) designed for the P2TB task. The J-P2TB model, trained on the generated simulation dataset, was used for joint segmentation of real-world panel point clouds via zero-shot learning. Compared to representative methods, our model outperformed them in most segmentation metrics while using 40% fewer learnable parameters. This Sim2Real result highlighted the efficacy of L-TreeGen in model training and the performance of J-P2TB for joint segmentation, demonstrating its strong accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability for real-world applications. These improvements would not only greatly benefit the development of robots for automated orchard operations but also advance digital twin technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional phenotyping mainly relies on manual measurement, which is accurate but inefficient, more importantly, endangering the health and safety of people. Several studies have explored computer vision-based methods to replace manual phenotyping. However, the 2D-based need extra calibration, or cause destruction to fruit, or can only measure limited and meaningless traits. The 3D-based need extra depth camera, which is expensive and unacceptable for most farmers. In this paper, we propose a non-contact tomato fruit phenotyping method, titled TomatoScanner, where RGB image is all you need for input. First, pixel feature is extracted by instance segmentation of our proposed EdgeYOLO with preprocessing of individual separation and pose correction. Second, depth feature is extracted by depth estimation of Depth Pro. Third, pixel and depth feature are fused to output phenotype results in reality. We establish self-built Tomato Phenotype Dataset to test TomatoScanner, which achieves excellent phenotyping on width, height, vertical area and volume, with median relative error of 5.63%, 7.03%, -0.64% and 37.06%, respectively. We propose and add three innovative modules - EdgeAttention, EdgeLoss and EdgeBoost - into EdgeYOLO, to enhance the segmentation accuracy on edge portion. Precision and mean Edge Error greatly improve from 0.943 and 5.641% to 0.986 and 2.963%, respectively. Meanwhile, EdgeYOLO keeps lightweight and efficient, with 48.7 M weights size and 76.34 FPS.

However, SAM primarily relies on sparse prompts such as point or bounding box, which may be suboptimal for fine-grained instance segmentation, particularly in endoscopic imagery, where precise localization is critical and existing prompts struggle to capture object boundaries effectively. To address this, we introduce S4M (Segment Anything with 4 Extreme Points), which augments SAM by leveraging extreme points -- the top-, bottom-, left-, and right-most points of an instance -- prompts. These points are intuitive to identify and provide a faster, structured alternative to box prompts. However, a na\"ive use of extreme points degrades performance, due to SAM's inability to interpret their semantic roles. To resolve this, we introduce dedicated learnable embeddings, enabling the model to distinguish extreme points from generic free-form points and better reason about their spatial relationships. We further propose an auxiliary training task through the Canvas module, which operates solely on prompts -- without vision input -- to predict a coarse instance mask. This encourages the model to internalize the relationship between extreme points and mask distributions, leading to more robust segmentation. S4M outperforms other SAM-based approaches on three endoscopic surgical datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex scenarios. Finally, we validate our approach through a human annotation study on surgical endoscopic videos, confirming that extreme points are faster to acquire than bounding boxes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[QueryCAD: Grounded Question Answering for CAD Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08704v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CAD models are widely used in industry and are essential for robotic automation processes. However, these models are rarely considered in novel AI-based approaches, such as the automatic synthesis of robot programs, as there are no readily available methods that would allow CAD models to be incorporated for the analysis, interpretation, or extraction of information. To address these limitations, we propose QueryCAD, the first system designed for CAD question answering, enabling the extraction of precise information from CAD models using natural language queries. QueryCAD incorporates SegCAD, an open-vocabulary instance segmentation model we developed to identify and select specific parts of the CAD model based on part descriptions. We further propose a CAD question answering benchmark to evaluate QueryCAD and establish a foundation for future research. Lastly, we integrate QueryCAD within an automatic robot program synthesis framework, validating its ability to enhance deep-learning solutions for robotics by enabling them to process CAD models (https://claudius-kienle.github.com/querycad).</p></details> |  | None |

Automated systems can facilitate the timely and resource-efficient documentation of changes, which is crucial for key processes such as progress tracking and quality control. This paper presents a method for image-based automated drywall analysis enabling construction progress and quality assessment through on-site camera systems. Our proposed solution integrates a deep learning-based instance segmentation model to detect and classify various drywall elements with an analysis module to cluster individual wall segments, estimate camera perspective distortions, and apply the corresponding corrections. This system extracts valuable information from images, enabling more accurate progress tracking and quality assessment on construction sites. Our main contributions include a fully automated pipeline for drywall analysis, improving instance segmentation accuracy through architecture modifications and targeted data augmentation, and a novel algorithm to extract important information from the segmentation results. Our modified model, enhanced with data augmentation, achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to other architectures, offering more detailed and precise information than existing approaches. Combined with the proposed drywall analysis steps, it enables the reliable automation of construction progress and quality assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we consider the problem of synchronous data collection from the open-source CARLA simulator using multiple sensors attached to vehicle based on user-defined criteria. We propose a novel, one-step framework that we refer to as Car-STAGE, based on CARLA simulator, to generate data using a graphical user interface (GUI) defining configuration parameters to data collection without any user intervention. This framework can utilize the user-defined configuration parameters such as choice of maps, number and configurations of sensors, environmental and lighting conditions etc. to run the simulation in the background, collecting high-dimensional sensor data from diverse sensors such as RGB Camera, LiDAR, Radar, Depth Camera, IMU Sensor, GNSS Sensor, Semantic Segmentation Camera, Instance Segmentation Camera, and Optical Flow Camera along with the ground-truths of the individual actors and storing the sensor data as well as ground-truth labels in a local or cloud-based database. The framework uses multiple threads where a main thread runs the server, a worker thread deals with queue and frame number and the rest of the threads processes the sensor data. The other way we derive speed up over the native implementation is by memory mapping the raw binary data into the disk and then converting the data into known formats at the end of data collection. We show that using these techniques, we gain a significant speed up over frames, under an increasing set of sensors and over the number of spawned objects.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its large storage requirements and high computational cost pose challenges for practical deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective strategy for efficient deployment, but we identify two key challenges in SAM that hinder the effectiveness of existing PTQ methods: the heavy-tailed and skewed distribution of post-GELU activations, and significant inter-channel variation in linear projection activations. To address these challenges, we propose AHCPTQ, an accurate and hardware-efficient PTQ method for SAM. AHCPTQ introduces hardware-compatible Hybrid Log-Uniform Quantization (HLUQ) to manage post-GELU activations, employing log2 quantization for dense small values and uniform quantization for sparse large values to enhance quantization resolution. Additionally, AHCPTQ incorporates Channel-Aware Grouping (CAG) to mitigate inter-channel variation by progressively clustering activation channels with similar distributions, enabling them to share quantization parameters and improving hardware efficiency. The combination of HLUQ and CAG not only enhances quantization effectiveness but also ensures compatibility with efficient hardware execution. For instance, under the W4A4 configuration on the SAM-L model, AHCPTQ achieves 36.6% mAP on instance segmentation with the DINO detector, while achieving a 7.89x speedup and 8.64x energy efficiency over its floating-point counterpart in FPGA implementation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Periodontal Bone Loss Analysis via Keypoint Detection With Heuristic Post-Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13477v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calculating percentage bone loss is a critical test for periodontal disease staging but is sometimes imprecise and time consuming when manually calculated. This study evaluates the application of a deep learning keypoint and object detection model, YOLOv8-pose, for the automatic identification of localised periodontal bone loss landmarks, conditions and staging. YOLOv8-pose was fine-tuned on 193 annotated periapical radiographs. We propose a keypoint detection metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), which normalises the metric to the average tooth size of teeth in the image. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that adjusts certain keypoint predictions to align with the edge of the related tooth, using a supporting instance segmentation model trained on an open source auxiliary dataset. The model can sufficiently detect bone loss keypoints, tooth boxes, and alveolar ridge resorption, but has insufficient performance at detecting detached periodontal ligament and furcation involvement. The model with post-processing demonstrated a PRCK 0.25 of 0.726 and PRCK 0.05 of 0.401 for keypoint detection, mAP 0.5 of 0.715 for tooth object detection, mesial dice score of 0.593 for periodontal staging, and dice score of 0.280 for furcation involvement. Our annotation methodology provides a stage agnostic approach to periodontal disease detection, by ensuring most keypoints are present for each tooth in the image, allowing small imbalanced datasets. Our PRCK metric allows accurate evaluation of keypoints in dental domains. Our post-processing module adjusts predicted keypoints correctly but is dependent on a minimum quality of prediction by the pose detection and segmentation models.

However, effectively integrating fine-grained perception tasks like detection and segmentation into these models remains a significant challenge. This is primarily because these tasks often rely heavily on task-specific designs and architectures that can complicate the modeling process. To address this challenge, we present \ours, a framework that \textbf{U}nifies \textbf{F}ine-grained visual perception tasks through an \textbf{O}pen-ended language interface. By transforming all perception targets into the language space, \ours unifies object-level detection, pixel-level segmentation, and image-level vision-language tasks into a single model. Additionally, we introduce a novel embedding retrieval approach that relies solely on the language interface to support segmentation tasks. Our framework bridges the gap between fine-grained perception and vision-language tasks, significantly simplifying architectural design and training strategies while achieving comparable or superior performance to methods with intricate task-specific designs. After multi-task training on five standard visual perception datasets, \ours outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generalist models by 12.3 mAP on COCO instance segmentation and 3.3 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation. Furthermore, our method seamlessly integrates with existing MLLMs, effectively combining fine-grained perception capabilities with their advanced language abilities, thereby enabling more challenging tasks such as reasoning segmentation.

In LiDAR panoptic segmentation, this challenge becomes even more pronounced due to the need to simultaneously address both semantic and instance segmentation from complex, high-dimensional point cloud data. In this work, we address the challenge of LiDAR panoptic segmentation with very few labeled samples by leveraging recent advances in label-efficient vision panoptic segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel method, Limited-Label LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation (L3PS), which requires only a minimal amount of labeled data. Our approach first utilizes a label-efficient 2D network to generate panoptic pseudo-labels from a small set of annotated images, which are subsequently projected onto point clouds. We then introduce a novel 3D refinement module that capitalizes on the geometric properties of point clouds. By incorporating clustering techniques, sequential scan accumulation, and ground point separation, this module significantly enhances the accuracy of the pseudo-labels, improving segmentation quality by up to +10.6 PQ and +7.9 mIoU. We demonstrate that these refined pseudo-labels can be used to effectively train off-the-shelf LiDAR segmentation networks. Through extensive experiments, we show that L3PS not only outperforms existing methods but also substantially reduces the annotation burden. We release the code of our work at https://l3ps.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches for nucleus detection in gigapixel WSIs utilize a sliding window methodology, which overlooks boarder contextual information (eg, tissue structure) and easily leads to inaccurate predictions. To address this problem, recent studies additionally crops a large Filed-of-View (FoV) region around each sliding window to extract contextual features. However, such methods substantially increases the inference latency. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient context-aware nucleus detection algorithm. Specifically, instead of leveraging large FoV regions, we aggregate contextual clues from off-the-shelf features of historically visited sliding windows. This design greatly reduces computational overhead. Moreover, compared to large FoV regions at a low magnification, the sliding window patches have higher magnification and provide finer-grained tissue details, thereby enhancing the detection accuracy. To further improve the efficiency, we propose a grid pooling technique to compress dense feature maps of each patch into a few contextual tokens. Finally, we craft OCELOT-seg, the first benchmark dedicated to context-aware nucleus instance segmentation.

As a result, a growing need for efficient compression methods optimized for machine vision, rather than human vision, has emerged. To meet this growing demand, several methods have been developed for image and video coding for machines. Unfortunately, while there is a substantial body of knowledge regarding rate-distortion theory for human vision, the same cannot be said of machine analysis. In this paper, we extend the current rate-distortion theory for machines, providing insight into important design considerations of machine-vision codecs. We then utilize this newfound understanding to improve several methods for learnable image coding for machines.

Directly adapting existing classification-based pruning methods proves ineffective due to their reliance on time-consuming model training process. To address this, we propose a novel Training-Free Dataset Pruning (TFDP) method for instance segmentation. Specifically, we leverage shape and class information from image annotations to design a Shape Complexity Score (SCS), refining it into a Scale-Invariant (SI-SCS) and Class-Balanced (CB-SCS) versions to address instance area variations and class imbalances, all without requiring model training. We achieve state-of-the-art results on VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO datasets, generalizing well across CNN and Transformer architectures. Remarkably, our approach accelerates the pruning process by an average of 1349$\times$ on COCO compared to the adapted baselines.

With large quantities of imaging data produced across a wide range of imaging conditions, institutes also produce many bespoke models trained on specific source data which then get collected in model banks or zoos. As the number of available models grows, so does the need for an efficient and reliable model selection method for a specific target dataset of interest. We focus on the unsupervised regime where no labels are available for the target dataset. Building on previous work linking model generalisation and consistency under perturbation, we propose the first unsupervised transferability estimator for semantic and instance segmentation tasks which doesn't require access to source training data or target domain labels. We evaluate the method on multiple segmentation problems across microscopy modalities, finding a strong correlation between the rankings based on our estimator and rankings based on target dataset performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures | None |

COU contains approximately 10K segmented images, annotated from images collected during a number of underwater robot field trials in diverse locations. COU has been created to address the lack of datasets with robust class coverage curated for underwater instance segmentation, which is particularly useful for training light-weight, real-time capable detectors for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). In addition, COU addresses the lack of diversity in object classes since the commonly available underwater image datasets focus only on marine life. Currently, COU contains images from both closed-water (pool) and open-water (lakes and oceans) environments, of 24 different classes of objects including marine debris, dive tools, and AUVs. To assess the efficacy of COU in training underwater object detectors, we use three state-of-the-art models to evaluate its performance and accuracy, using a combination of standard accuracy and efficiency metrics. The improved performance of COU-trained detectors over those solely trained on terrestrial data demonstrates the clear advantage of training with annotated underwater images. We make COU available for broad use under open-source licenses.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RMP-SAM: Towards Real-Time Multi-Purpose Segment Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10228v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent segmentation methods, which adopt large-scale data training and transformer architecture, aim to create one foundation model that can perform multiple tasks. However, most of these methods rely on heavy encoder and decoder frameworks, hindering their performance in real-time scenarios. To explore real-time segmentation, recent advancements primarily focus on semantic segmentation within specific environments, such as autonomous driving. However, they often overlook the generalization ability of these models across diverse scenarios. Therefore, to fill this gap, this work explores a novel real-time segmentation setting called real-time multi-purpose segmentation. It contains three fundamental sub-tasks: interactive segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and video instance segmentation. Unlike previous methods, which use a specific design for each task, we aim to use only a single end-to-end model to accomplish all these tasks in real-time. To meet real-time requirements and balance multi-task learning, we present a novel dynamic convolution-based method, Real-Time Multi-Purpose SAM (RMP-SAM). It contains an efficient encoder and an efficient decoupled adapter to perform prompt-driven decoding. Moreover, we further explore different training strategies and one new adapter design to boost co-training performance further. We benchmark several strong baselines by extending existing works to support our multi-purpose segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMP-SAM is effective and generalizes well on proposed benchmarks and other specific semantic tasks. Our implementation of RMP-SAM achieves the optimal balance between accuracy and speed for these tasks.Our code and model are available at https://github.com/xushilin1/RAP-SAM/.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR-...</summary><p>ICLR-2025 (oral).

The process also slows down the model development and training process. In this study, we presented a novel method for deep learning-based instance segmentation of apples in commercial orchards that eliminates the need for labor-intensive field data collection and manual annotation. Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM), we synthetically generated orchard images and automatically annotated them using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) integrated with a YOLO11 base model. This method significantly reduces reliance on physical sensors and manual data processing, presenting a major advancement in "Agricultural AI". The synthetic, auto-annotated dataset was used to train the YOLO11 model for Apple instance segmentation, which was then validated on real orchard images. The results showed that the automatically generated annotations achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.9513 and an IoU of 0.9303, validating the accuracy and overlap of the mask annotations. All YOLO11 configurations, trained solely on these synthetic datasets with automated annotations, accurately recognized and delineated apples, highlighting the method's efficacy. Specifically, the YOLO11m-seg configuration achieved a mask precision of 0.902 and a mask mAP@50 of 0.833 on test images collected from a commercial orchard. Additionally, the YOLO11l-seg configuration outperformed other models in validation on 40 LLM-generated images, achieving the highest mask precision and mAP@50 metrics.

Unknown Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS), which aims to identify all objects in unknown categories and backgrounds, has become a key capability for various robotic tasks. However, existing methods struggle with over-segmentation and under-segmentation, leading to failures in manipulation tasks such as grasping. To address these challenges, we propose QuBER (Quadruple Boundary Error Refinement), a novel error-informed refinement approach for high-quality UOIS. QuBER first estimates quadruple boundary errors-true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative pixels-at the instance boundaries of the initial segmentation. It then refines the segmentation using an error-guided fusion mechanism, effectively correcting both fine-grained and instance-level segmentation errors. Extensive evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that QuBER outperforms state-of-the-art methods and consistently improves various UOIS methods while maintaining a fast inference time of less than 0.1 seconds. Furthermore, we show that QuBER improves the success rate of grasping target objects in cluttered environments.

This limitation stems from existing datasets, which typically feature few well-balanced classes. Although few datasets include unbalanced class annotations, they lack the diverse incremental scenarios necessary for evaluating methods under incremental settings. Addressing these challenges requires frameworks that handle both incremental learning and class imbalance. However, existing methods for 3D incremental segmentation rely heavily on large exemplar replay, focusing only on incremental learning while neglecting class imbalance. Moreover, frequency-based tuning for balanced learning is impractical in these setups due to the lack of prior class statistics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework to tackle both \textbf{C}ontinual \textbf{L}earning and class \textbf{Imb}alance for \textbf{3D} instance segmentation (\textbf{CLIMB-3D}). Our proposed approach combines Exemplar Replay (ER), Knowledge Distillation (KD), and a novel Imbalance Correction (IC) module. Unlike prior methods, our framework minimizes ER usage, with KD preventing forgetting and supporting the IC module in compiling past class statistics to balance learning of rare classes during incremental updates. To evaluate our framework, we design three incremental scenarios based on class frequency, semantic similarity, and random grouping that aim to mirror real-world dynamics in 3D environments. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an increase of up to 16.76\% in mAP compared to the baseline.

While integrated object cognition helps mitigate semantic ambiguity in point-wise feature maps, efficiently obtaining rich semantic understanding and robust incremental reconstruction at the instance-level remains challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce OpenVox, a real-time incremental open-vocabulary probabilistic instance voxel representation. In the front-end, we design an efficient instance segmentation and comprehension pipeline that enhances language reasoning through encoding captions. In the back-end, we implement probabilistic instance voxels and formulate the cross-frame incremental fusion process into two subtasks: instance association and live map evolution, ensuring robustness to sensor and segmentation noise. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that OpenVox achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and open-vocabulary retrieval. Furthermore, real-world robotics experiments validate OpenVox's capability for stable, real-time operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://open-vox.github.io</p></details> | None |

Existing methods based on instance segmentation suffer from poor generalization when extended to large-scale data production and fail to achieve low-cost human interaction. This prompt paradigm inspires us to design a promptable framework for roof and offset extraction, and transforms end-to-end algorithms into promptable methods. Within this framework, we propose a novel Offset-Building Model (OBM). Based on prompt prediction, we first discover a common pattern of predicting offsets and tailored Distance-NMS (DNMS) algorithms for offset optimization. To rigorously evaluate the algorithm's capabilities, we introduce a prompt-based evaluation method, where our model reduces offset errors by 16.6\% and improves roof Intersection over Union (IoU) by 10.8\% compared to other models. Leveraging the common patterns in predicting offsets, DNMS algorithms enable models to further reduce offset vector loss by 6.5\%. To further validate the generalization of models, we tested them using a newly proposed test set, Huizhou test set, with over 7,000 manually annotated instance samples.

In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, ZeroPS, which achieves high-quality knowledge transfer from 2D pretrained foundation models (FMs), SAM and GLIP, to 3D object point clouds. We aim to explore the natural relationship between multi-view correspondence and the FMs' prompt mechanism and build bridges on it. In ZeroPS, the relationship manifests as follows: 1) lifting 2D to 3D by leveraging co-viewed regions and SAM's prompt mechanism, 2) relating 1D classes to 3D parts by leveraging 2D-3D view projection and GLIP's prompt mechanism, and 3) enhancing prediction performance by leveraging multi-view observations. Extensive evaluations on the PartNetE and AKBSeg benchmarks demonstrate that ZeroPS significantly outperforms the SOTA method across zero-shot unlabeled and instance segmentation tasks. ZeroPS does not require additional training or fine-tuning for the FMs. ZeroPS applies to both simulated and real-world data. It is hardly affected by domain shift.

However, the major bottleneck is that these models do not have the capacity to recognize any unseen novel classes beyond the training categories in diverse real-world applications. Therefore, we are in urgent need of a framework that can simultaneously be applicable to both 3D point cloud segmentation and detection, particularly in the circumstances where the labels are rather scarce. This work presents a generalized and straightforward framework for dealing with 3D scene understanding when the labeled scenes are quite limited. To extract knowledge for novel categories from the pre-trained vision-language models, we propose a hierarchical feature-aligned pre-training and knowledge distillation strategy to extract and distill meaningful information from large-scale vision-language models, which helps benefit the open-vocabulary scene understanding tasks. To encourage latent instance discrimination and to guarantee efficiency, we propose the unsupervised region-level semantic contrastive learning scheme for point clouds, using confident predictions of the neural network to discriminate the intermediate feature embeddings at multiple stages. In the limited reconstruction case, our proposed approach, termed WS3D++, ranks 1st on the large-scale ScanNet benchmark on both the task of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. Extensive experiments with both indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in both data-efficient learning and open-world few-shot learning.

Effective weed management is especially important for crops with high worldwide production such as maize, to maximize crop yield for meeting increasing global demands. Advances in near-sensing and computer vision enable the development of new tools for weed management. Specifically, state-of-the-art segmentation models, coupled with novel sensing technologies, can facilitate timely and accurate weeding and monitoring systems. However, learning-based approaches require annotated data and show a lack of generalization to aerial imaging for different crops. We present a novel dataset for semantic and instance segmentation of crops and weeds in agricultural maize fields. The multispectral UAV-based dataset contains images with RGB, red-edge, and near-infrared bands, a large number of plant instances, dense annotations for maize and four weed classes, and is multitemporal. We provide extensive baseline results for both tasks, including probabilistic methods to quantify prediction uncertainty, improve model calibration, and demonstrate the approach's applicability to out-of-distribution data. The results show the effectiveness of the two additional bands compared to RGB only, and better performance in our target domain than models trained on existing datasets. We hope our dataset advances research on methods and operational systems for fine-grained weed identification, enhancing the robustness and applicability of UAV-based weed management.

However, due to the unique characteristics of image data, adapting SSMs from natural language processing to computer vision has not outperformed the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing vision SSMs primarily leverage manually designed scans to flatten image patches into sequences locally or globally. This approach disrupts the original semantic spatial adjacency of the image and lacks flexibility, making it difficult to capture complex image structures. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Scan (DAS), a data-driven method that adaptively allocates scanning orders and regions. This enables more flexible modeling capabilities while maintaining linear computational complexity and global modeling capacity. Based on DAS, we further propose the vision backbone DAMamba, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art vision Mamba models in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, it surpasses some of the latest state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs.

The main challenges arise from the difficulty in accurately segmenting instances and the high cost of precise mask-level annotations for fully-supervised training.In this work, we propose a fourier guidance framework for solving the weakly-supervised nuclear instance segmentation problem. In this framework, we construct a fourier guidance module to fuse the priori information into the training process of the model, which facilitates the model to capture the relevant features of the nuclear. Meanwhile, in order to further improve the model's ability to represent the features of nuclear, we propose the guide-based instance level contrastive module. This module makes full use of the framework's own properties and guide information to effectively enhance the representation features of nuclear. We show on two public datasets that our model can outperform current SOTA methods under fully-supervised design, and in weakly-supervised experiments, with only a small amount of labeling our model still maintains close to the performance under full supervision.In addition, we also perform generalization experiments on a private dataset, and without any labeling, our model is able to segment nuclear images that have not been seen during training quite effectively.

It serves as a valuable tool for sketch editing tasks, such as moving, scaling, or removing specific components. While image segmentation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recent years, sketches present unique challenges for these models due to their sparse nature and wide variation in styles. We introduce SketchSeg, a method for instance segmentation of raster scene sketches. Our approach adapts state-of-the-art image segmentation and object detection models to the sketch domain by employing class-agnostic fine-tuning and refining segmentation masks using depth cues. Furthermore, our method organizes sketches into sorted layers, where occluded instances are inpainted, enabling advanced sketch editing applications. As existing datasets in this domain lack variation in sketch styles, we construct a synthetic scene sketch segmentation dataset featuring sketches with diverse brush strokes and varying levels of detail. We use this dataset to demonstrate the robustness of our approach and will release it to promote further research in the field.

These models have performed particularly well in image classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance segmentation has accelerated with the introduction of the new architecture, with over 80% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset based on either the ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper focuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not using) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the iSAID dataset. The experimental results observed during this research were analyzed based on three objectives. First, we studied the use of a weighted fused loss function to maximize the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score and Dice score while minimizing entropy or class representation loss. Second, we compared transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic segmentation model, against a generic UNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time. Third, we examined the trade-offs between the two models in comparison to current state-of-the-art segmentation models. We show that the novel combined weighted loss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance compared to transfer learning with ViT.

| **[Open-YOLO 3D: Towards Fast and Accurate Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02548v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation show strong promise, but at the cost of slow inference speed and high computation requirements. This high computation cost is typically due to their heavy reliance on 3D clip features, which require computationally expensive 2D foundation models like Segment Anything (SAM) and CLIP for multi-view aggregation into 3D. As a consequence, this hampers their applicability in many real-world applications that require both fast and accurate predictions. To this end, we propose a fast yet accurate open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation approach, named Open-YOLO 3D, that effectively leverages only 2D object detection from multi-view RGB images for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. We address this task by generating class-agnostic 3D masks for objects in the scene and associating them with text prompts. We observe that the projection of class-agnostic 3D point cloud instances already holds instance information; thus, using SAM might only result in redundancy that unnecessarily increases the inference time. We empirically find that a better performance of matching text prompts to 3D masks can be achieved in a faster fashion with a 2D object detector. We validate our Open-YOLO 3D on two benchmarks, ScanNet200 and Replica, under two scenarios: (i) with ground truth masks, where labels are required for given object proposals, and (ii) with class-agnostic 3D proposals generated from a 3D proposal network. Our Open-YOLO 3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while obtaining up to $\sim$16$\times$ speedup compared to the best existing method in literature. On ScanNet200 val. set, our Open-YOLO 3D achieves mean average precision (mAP) of 24.7\% while operating at 22 seconds per scene.

This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

However, the creation of high-quality annotated datasets for training remains a major challenge. This study introduces a novel single-stage approach (HistoSmith) for generating image-label pairs to augment histology datasets. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that utilize diffusion models with separate components for label and image generation, our approach employs a latent diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of cellular layouts, classification masks, and histology images. This model enables tailored data generation by conditioning on user-defined parameters such as cell types, quantities, and tissue types. Trained on the Conic H&E histopathology dataset and the Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset, the model generates realistic and diverse labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in cell instance segmentation and classification, particularly for underrepresented cell types like neutrophils in the Conic dataset. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to address data scarcity challenges.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generalized Class Discovery in Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08149v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the task of generalized class discovery (GCD) in instance segmentation. The goal is to discover novel classes and obtain a model capable of segmenting instances of both known and novel categories, given labeled and unlabeled data. Since the real world contains numerous objects with long-tailed distributions, the instance distribution for each class is inherently imbalanced. To address the imbalanced distributions, we propose an instance-wise temperature assignment (ITA) method for contrastive learning and class-wise reliability criteria for pseudo-labels. The ITA method relaxes instance discrimination for samples belonging to head classes to enhance GCD. The reliability criteria are to avoid excluding most pseudo-labels for tail classes when training an instance segmentation network using pseudo-labels from GCD. Additionally, we propose dynamically adjusting the criteria to leverage diverse samples in the early stages while relying only on reliable pseudo-labels in the later stages. We also introduce an efficient soft attention module to encode object-specific representations for GCD. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method by conducting experiments on two settings: COCO$_{half}$ + LVIS and LVIS + Visual Genome. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |
| **[EmbodiedSAM: Online Segment Any 3D Thing in Real Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11811v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves leading performance even compared with offline methods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in open-vocabulary and data-efficient setting.

In domains characterized by cluttered scenes and high object variability, most methods call for vast labeled datasets, laboriously hand-annotated, with the aim of training capable models. Once deployed, the challenge of generalizing to unfamiliar objects implies that the model must evolve alongside its domain. To address this, we propose a novel framework that combines Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Learning Through Interaction (LTI), allowing a model to learn by observing scene alterations and leverage visual consistency despite temporal gaps without requiring curated data of interaction sequences. As a result, our approach exploits partially annotated data through self-supervision and incorporates temporal context using pseudo-sequences generated from unlabeled still images. We validate our method on two common benchmarks, ARMBench mix-object-tote and OCID, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on ARMBench, we attain an $\text{AP}_{50}$ of $86.37$, almost a $20\%$ improvement over existing work, and obtain remarkable results in scenarios with extremely low annotation, achieving an $\text{AP}_{50}$ score of $84.89$ with just $1 \%$ of annotated data compared to $72$ presented in ARMBench on the fully annotated counterpart.</p></details> |  | None |

Current datasets for training and evaluating these methods are limited in scale and diversity. To address this, we propose a methodology for creating high-quality inpainting datasets and apply it to create DiQuID, comprising over 95,000 inpainted images generated from 78,000 original images sourced from MS-COCO, RAISE, and OpenImages. Our methodology consists of three components: (1) Semantically Aligned Object Replacement (SAOR) that identifies suitable objects through instance segmentation and generates contextually appropriate prompts, (2) Multiple Model Image Inpainting (MMII) that employs various state-of-the-art inpainting pipelines primarily based on diffusion models to create diverse manipulations, and (3) Uncertainty-Guided Deceptiveness Assessment (UGDA) that evaluates image realism through comparative analysis with originals. The resulting dataset surpasses existing ones in diversity, aesthetic quality, and technical quality. We provide comprehensive benchmarking results using state-of-the-art forgery detection methods, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in evaluating and improving detection algorithms. Through a human study with 42 participants on 1,000 images, we show that while humans struggle with images classified as deceiving by our methodology, models trained on our dataset maintain high performance on these challenging cases.

In this work, we propose a new deep learning framework, CISCA, for automatic cell instance segmentation and classification in histological slices. At the core of CISCA is a network architecture featuring a lightweight U-Net with three heads in the decoder. The first head classifies pixels into boundaries between neighboring cells, cell bodies, and background, while the second head regresses four distance maps along four directions. The outputs from the first and second heads are integrated through a tailored post-processing step, which ultimately produces the segmentation of individual cells. The third head enables the simultaneous classification of cells into relevant classes, if required. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using four datasets, including CoNIC, PanNuke, and MoNuSeg, which are publicly available H&Estained datasets that cover diverse tissue types and magnifications. In addition, we introduce CytoDArk0, the first annotated dataset of Nissl-stained histological images of the mammalian brain, containing nearly 40k annotated neurons and glia cells, aimed at facilitating advancements in digital neuropathology and brain cytoarchitecture studies. We evaluate CISCA against other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its versatility, robustness, and accuracy in segmenting and classifying cells across diverse tissue types, magnifications, and staining techniques. This makes CISCA well-suited for detailed analyses of cell morphology and efficient cell counting in both digital pathology workflows and brain cytoarchitecture research.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances primarily target at crafting quantizers to deal with peculiar activations characterized by ViTs. However, most existing methods underestimate the information loss incurred by weight quantization, resulting in significant performance deterioration, particularly in low-bit cases. Furthermore, a common practice in quantizing post-Softmax activations of ViTs is to employ logarithmic transformations, which unfortunately prioritize less informative values around zero. This approach introduces additional redundancies, ultimately leading to suboptimal quantization efficacy. To handle these, this paper proposes an innovative PTQ method tailored for ViTs, termed AIQViT (Architecture-Informed Post-training Quantization for ViTs). First, we design an architecture-informed low rank compensation mechanism, wherein learnable low-rank weights are introduced to compensate for the degradation caused by weight quantization. Second, we design a dynamic focusing quantizer to accommodate the unbalanced distribution of post-Softmax activations, which dynamically selects the most valuable interval for higher quantization resolution. Extensive experiments on five vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, point cloud classification, and point cloud part segmentation, demonstrate the superiority of AIQViT over state-of-the-art PTQ methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p></details> |  | None |

Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention due to their elegant pipelines, reduced manual selection of geometric properties, and superior performance. However, transformer-based methods fail to simultaneously maintain strong position and content information during query initialization. Additionally, due to supervision at each decoder layer, there exists a phenomenon of object disappearance with the deepening of layers. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Beyond the Final Layer: Hierarchical Query Fusion Transformer with Agent-Interpolation Initialization for 3D Instance Segmentation (BFL). Specifically, an Agent-Interpolation Initialization Module is designed to generate resilient queries capable of achieving a balance between foreground coverage and content learning. Additionally, a Hierarchical Query Fusion Decoder is designed to retain low overlap queries, mitigating the decrease in recall with the deepening of layers. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++ and S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BFL.</p></details> | Under review | None |

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix</p></details> | None |

Traditional supervised learningbased segmentation techniques require extensive annotated datasets, which are impractical for the diversity of objects encountered in real-world scenarios. Unseen Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS) methods aim to address this by training models on synthetic data to generalize to novel objects, but they often suffer from the simulation-to-reality gap. This paper proposes a novel approach (ZISVFM) for solving UOIS by leveraging the powerful zero-shot capability of the segment anything model (SAM) and explicit visual representations from a selfsupervised vision transformer (ViT). The proposed framework operates in three stages: (1) generating object-agnostic mask proposals from colorized depth images using SAM, (2) refining these proposals using attention-based features from the selfsupervised ViT to filter non-object masks, and (3) applying K-Medoids clustering to generate point prompts that guide SAM towards precise object segmentation. Experimental validation on two benchmark datasets and a self-collected dataset demonstrates the superior performance of ZISVFM in complex environments, including hierarchical settings such as cabinets, drawers, and handheld objects.

However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</p></details> |  | None |

Given the 3D point cloud and multiple posed RGB-D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments 3D instances by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames. Our key idea involves locating SAM prompts in 3D to align their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring the view consistency of SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest selecting prompts from the initial set guided by the information of SAM-predicted masks across all views, which enhances the overall performance. We further propose to consolidate different prompts if they are segmenting different surface parts of the same 3D instance, bringing a more comprehensive segmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that our method achieves comparable or better performance compared to previous zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases surpasses human annotations.

In this work, we propose META, a simple and fast ViT adapter that can improve the model's memory efficiency and decrease memory time consumption by reducing the inefficient memory access operations. Our method features a memory-efficient adapter block that enables the common sharing of layer normalization between the self-attention and feed-forward network layers, thereby reducing the model's reliance on normalization operations. Within the proposed block, the cross-shaped self-attention is employed to reduce the model's frequent reshaping operations. Moreover, we augment the adapter block with a lightweight convolutional branch that can enhance local inductive biases, particularly beneficial for the dense prediction tasks, e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The adapter block is finally formulated in a cascaded manner to compute diverse head features, thereby enriching the variety of feature representations. Empirically, extensive evaluations on multiple representative datasets validate that META substantially enhances the predicted quality, while achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT.

Recently, 3DGS Fields have emerged as a highly efficient and explicit alternative to Neural Field-based methods for high-quality Novel View Synthesis. Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

Current methods leverage the generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer instance-specific prompts from these task-generic prompts in order to guide the segmentation process. However, when VLMs struggle to generalise to some image instances, predicting instance-specific prompts becomes poor. To solve this problem, we introduce \textbf{I}nstance-specific \textbf{N}egative Mining for \textbf{T}ask-Generic Promptable Segmentation (\textbf{INT}). The key idea of INT is to adaptively reduce the influence of irrelevant (negative) prior knowledge whilst to increase the use the most plausible prior knowledge, selected by negative mining with higher contrast, in order to optimise instance-specific prompts generation. Specifically, INT consists of two components: (1) instance-specific prompt generation, which progressively fliters out incorrect information in prompt generation; (2) semantic mask generation, which ensures each image instance segmentation matches correctly the semantics of the instance-specific prompts. INT is validated on six datasets, including camouflaged objects and medical images, demonstrating its effectiveness, robustness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>A new...</summary><p>A new task-generic promptable segmentation approach</p></details> | None |

However, a performance gap persists between foundation models and task-specific, specialized models. Fine-tuning foundation models on downstream datasets is often necessary to bridge this gap. Unfortunately, obtaining fully annotated ground truth for downstream datasets is both challenging and costly. To address this limitation, we propose a novel test-time training paradigm that enhances the performance of foundation models on downstream datasets without requiring full annotations. Specifically, our method employs simple point prompts to guide a test-time semi-self-supervised training task. The model learns by resolving the ambiguity of the point prompt through various augmentations. This approach directly tackles challenges in the medical imaging field, where acquiring annotations is both time-intensive and expensive.

The method is fully based on the DETR paradigm and achieves end-to-end inference through iterative and progressive mechanisms to optimize contours. To improve efficiency and accuracy, we develop two novel techniques: sub-contour decoupling mechanisms and contour fine-grained distribution refinement. In the sub-contour decoupling mechanism, we propose a deformable attention-based module that adaptively selects sampling regions based on the current predicted contour, enabling more effective capturing of object boundary information. Additionally, we design a multi-stage optimization process to enhance segmentation precision by progressively refining sub-contours. The contour fine-grained distribution refinement technique aims to further improve the ability to express fine details of contours. These innovations enable Contourformer to achieve stable and precise segmentation for each instance while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Contourformer on multiple benchmark datasets, including SBD, COCO, and KINS. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and inference speed.

Accurate segmentation of each leaf is crucial for plant-related applications such as the fine-grained monitoring of plant growth and crop yield estimation. This task is challenging because of the high similarity (in shape and colour), great size variation, and heavy occlusions among leaf instances. Furthermore, the typically small size of annotated leaf datasets makes it more difficult to learn the distinctive features needed for precise segmentation. We hypothesise that the key to overcoming the these challenges lies in the specific spatial patterns of leaf distribution. In this paper, we propose the Guided Mask Transformer (GMT), which leverages and integrates leaf spatial distribution priors into a Transformer-based segmentor. These spatial priors are embedded in a set of guide functions that map leaves at different positions into a more separable embedding space.

The modular design of D-PLS allows for seamless integration on top of any semantic segmentation architecture, without requiring architectural changes or retraining. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI dataset, where it demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline in both classification and association tasks, as measured by the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric. Furthermore, we show that our decoupled architecture not only enhances instance prediction but also surpasses the baseline due to advancements in single-scan semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional methods for channel prediction face challenges in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, practicality, and generalizability. Additionally, they often fail to effectively leverage environmental features. Within the framework of integration communication and artificial intelligence as a pivotal development vision for 6G, it is imperative to achieve intelligent prediction of channel characteristics. Vision-aided methods have been employed in various wireless communication tasks, excluding channel prediction, and have demonstrated enhanced efficiency and performance. In this paper, we propose a vision-aided two-stage model for channel prediction in millimeter wave vehicular communication scenarios, realizing accurate received power prediction utilizing solely RGB images. Firstly, we obtain original images of propagation environment through an RGB camera. Secondly, three typical computer vision methods including object detection, instance segmentation and binary mask are employed for environmental information extraction from original images in stage 1, and prediction of received power based on processed images is implemented in stage 2. Pre-trained YOLOv8 and ResNets are used in stages 1 and 2, respectively, and fine-tuned on datasets. Finally, we conduct five experiments to evaluate the performance of proposed model, demonstrating its feasibility, accuracy and generalization capabilities. The model proposed in this paper offers novel solutions for achieving intelligent channel prediction in vehicular communications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</p></details> | None |

However, the complexity and size of the ultrasonic scans make it challenging to identify defects through visual inspection or machine learning models. Using computer vision techniques to identify defects from ultrasonic scans is an evolving research area. In this study, we used instance segmentation to identify the presence of defects in the ultrasonic scan images of composite panels that are representative of real components manufactured in aerospace. We used two models based on Mask-RCNN (Detectron 2) and YOLO 11 respectively. Additionally, we implemented a simple statistical pre-processing technique that reduces the burden of requiring custom-tailored pre-processing techniques.

Existing methods for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation primarily focus on identifying object-level instances but struggle with finer-grained scene entities such as object parts, or regions described by generic attributes. In this work, we introduce Search3D, an approach to construct hierarchical open-vocabulary 3D scene representations, enabling 3D search at multiple levels of granularity: fine-grained object parts, entire objects, or regions described by attributes like materials. Unlike prior methods, Search3D shifts towards a more flexible open-vocabulary 3D search paradigm, moving beyond explicit object-centric queries. For systematic evaluation, we further contribute a scene-scale open-vocabulary 3D part segmentation benchmark based on MultiScan, along with a set of open-vocabulary fine-grained part annotations on ScanNet++. Search3D outperforms baselines in scene-scale open-vocabulary 3D part segmentation, while maintaining strong performance in segmenting 3D objects and materials.

The diversity of foreign objects complicates dense annotation, as shown in insufficient existing datasets. To address this, we propose the simple generation of synthetic data through (1) insertion of arbitrary shapes (lines, polygons, ellipses) with varying contrasts and opacities, and (2) cut-paste augmentations from a small set of semi-automatically extracted labels. These insertions are guided by anatomy labels to ensure realistic placements, such as stents appearing only in relevant vessels. Our approach enables networks to segment complex structures with minimal manually labeled data. Notably, it achieves performance comparable to fully supervised models while using 93\% fewer manual annotations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods usually accept as input a RGB 2D image. On the other side, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors with many layers provide images that are similar to those obtained from a traditional low resolution RGB camera. Following this principle, a new dataset for segmenting cars in pseudo-RGB images has been generated. This dataset combines the information given by the LiDAR sensor into a Spherical Range Image (SRI), concretely the reflectivity, near infrared and signal intensity 2D images. These images are then fed into instance segmentation NNs. These NNs segment the cars that appear in these images, having as result a Bounding Box (BB) and mask precision of 88% and 81.5% respectively with You Only Look Once (YOLO)-v8 large. By using this segmentation NN, some trackers have been applied so as to follow each car segmented instance along a video feed, having great performance in real world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version of the work accepted at 5th International Conference on Robotics, Computer Vision and Intelligent Systems (ROBOVIS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods for detecting damages like cracks and spalls are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. To address these challenges, this study explores advanced data-driven techniques using deep learning for automated damage detection and analysis. Two state-of-the-art instance segmentation models, YOLO-v7 instance segmentation and Mask R-CNN, were evaluated using a dataset comprising 400 images, augmented to 10,995 images through geometric and color-based transformations to enhance robustness. The models were trained and validated using a dataset split into 90% training set, validation and test set 10%. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, mean average precision (mAP@0.5), and frames per second (FPS) were used for evaluation. YOLO-v7 achieved a superior mAP@0.5 of 96.1% and processed 40 FPS, outperforming Mask R-CNN, which achieved a mAP@0.5 of 92.1% with a slower processing speed of 18 FPS. The findings recommend YOLO-v7 instance segmentation model for real-time, high-speed structural health monitoring, while Mask R-CNN is better suited for detailed offline assessments.

| **[ClusterViG: Efficient Globally Aware Vision GNNs via Image Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10640v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have dominated the field of Computer Vision (CV). Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.38+ AP for object detection and 11.91+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively.

However, forestry operations such as harvesting, handling and measuring logs still require substantial human labor in remote environments posing significant safety risks. Progressively automating these tasks has the potential of increasing their efficiency as well as safety, but requires an accurate detection of individual logs as well as live trees and their context. Although initial approaches have been proposed for this challenging application domain, specialized data and algorithms are still too scarce to develop robust solutions. To mitigate this gap, we introduce the TimberVision dataset, consisting of more than 2k annotated RGB images containing a total of 51k trunk components including cut and lateral surfaces, thereby surpassing any existing dataset in this domain in terms of both quantity and detail by a large margin. Based on this data, we conduct a series of ablation experiments for oriented object detection and instance segmentation and evaluate the influence of multiple scene parameters on model performance. We introduce a generic framework to fuse the components detected by our models for both tasks into unified trunk representations. Furthermore, we automatically derive geometric properties and apply multi-object tracking to further enhance robustness. Our detection and tracking approach provides highly descriptive and accurate trunk representations solely from RGB image data, even under challenging environmental conditions. Our solution is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios and can be readily combined with other sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025.

| **[Toward Realistic Camouflaged Object Detection: Benchmarks and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07297v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily relies on semantic or instance segmentation methods. While these methods have made significant advancements in identifying the contours of camouflaged objects, they may be inefficient or cost-effective for tasks that only require the specific location of the object. Object detection algorithms offer an optimized solution for Realistic Camouflaged Object Detection (RCOD) in such cases. However, detecting camouflaged objects remains a formidable challenge due to the high degree of similarity between the features of the objects and their backgrounds. Unlike segmentation methods that perform pixel-wise comparisons to differentiate between foreground and background, object detectors omit this analysis, further aggravating the challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a camouflage-aware feature refinement (CAFR) strategy. Since camouflaged objects are not rare categories, CAFR fully utilizes a clear perception of the current object within the prior knowledge of large models to assist detectors in deeply understanding the distinctions between background and foreground. Specifically, in CAFR, we introduce the Adaptive Gradient Propagation (AGP) module that fine-tunes all feature extractor layers in large detection models to fully refine class-specific features from camouflaged contexts. We then design the Sparse Feature Refinement (SFR) module that optimizes the transformer-based feature extractor to focus primarily on capturing class-specific features in camouflaged scenarios. To facilitate the assessment of RCOD tasks, we manually annotate the labels required for detection on three existing segmentation COD datasets, creating a new benchmark for RCOD tasks.

| **[Static Segmentation by Tracking: A Frustratingly Label-Efficient Approach to Fine-Grained Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06749v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study image segmentation in the biological domain, particularly trait and part segmentation from specimen images (e.g., butterfly wing stripes or beetle body parts). This is a crucial, fine-grained task that aids in understanding the biology of organisms. The conventional approach involves hand-labeling masks, often for hundreds of images per species, and training a segmentation model to generalize these labels to other images, which can be exceedingly laborious. We present a label-efficient method named Static Segmentation by Tracking (SST). SST is built upon the insight: while specimens of the same species have inherent variations, the traits and parts we aim to segment show up consistently. This motivates us to concatenate specimen images into a ``pseudo-video'' and reframe trait and part segmentation as a tracking problem. Concretely, SST generates masks for unlabeled images by propagating annotated or predicted masks from the ``pseudo-preceding'' images. Powered by Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM~2) initially developed for video segmentation, we show that SST can achieve high-quality trait and part segmentation with merely one labeled image per species -- a breakthrough for analyzing specimen images. We further develop a cycle-consistent loss to fine-tune the model, again using one labeled image. Additionally, we highlight the broader potential of SST, including one-shot instance segmentation on images taken in the wild and trait-based image retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

On Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, tracking seasonal trends and weather patterns of clouds provides crucial insights into one of the most complex climates in the Solar System, yet much of the available image data are still analyzed in a conventional way. In this work, we apply a Mask R-CNN trained via transfer learning to perform instance segmentation of clouds in Titan images acquired by the Cassini spacecraft - a previously unexplored approach to a big data problem in planetary science. We demonstrate that an automated technique can provide quantitative measures for clouds, such as areas and centroids, that may otherwise be prohibitively time-intensive to produce by human mapping. Furthermore, despite Titan specific challenges, our approach yields accuracy comparable to contemporary cloud identification studies on Earth and other worlds. We compare the efficiencies of human-driven versus algorithmic approaches, showing that transfer learning provides speed-ups that may open new horizons for data investigation for Titan. Moreover, we suggest that such approaches have broad potential for application to similar problems in planetary science where they are currently under-utilized. Future planned missions to the planets and remote sensing initiatives for the Earth promise to provide a deluge of image data in the coming years that will benefit strongly from leveraging machine learning approaches to perform the analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Comics Understanding, a complex and multifaceted field, stands to greatly benefit from these advances. Comics, as a medium, combine rich visual and textual narratives, challenging AI models with tasks that span image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and deeper narrative comprehension through sequential panels. However, the unique structure of comics -- characterized by creative variations in style, reading order, and non-linear storytelling -- presents a set of challenges distinct from those in other visual-language domains. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of Comics Understanding from both dataset and task perspectives.

To consider single trees, a forest point cloud needs to be segmented into individual tree point clouds. Existing segmentation methods are usually based on hand-crafted algorithms, such as identifying trunks and growing trees from them, and face difficulties in dense forests with overlapping tree crowns. In this study, we propose TreeLearn, a deep learning-based approach for tree instance segmentation of forest point clouds. TreeLearn is trained on already segmented point clouds in a data-driven manner, making it less reliant on predefined features and algorithms. Furthermore, TreeLearn is implemented as a fully automatic pipeline and does not rely on extensive hyperparameter tuning, which makes it easy to use. Additionally, we introduce a new manually segmented benchmark forest dataset containing 156 full trees. The data is generated by mobile laser scanning and contributes to create a larger and more diverse data basis for model development and fine-grained instance segmentation evaluation. We trained TreeLearn on forest point clouds of 6665 trees, labeled using the Lidar360 software. An evaluation on the benchmark dataset shows that TreeLearn performs as well as the algorithm used to generate its training data. Furthermore, the performance can be vastly improved by fine-tuning the model using manually annotated datasets. We evaluate TreeLearn on our benchmark dataset and the Wytham Woods dataset, outperforming the recent SegmentAnyTree, ForAINet and TLS2Trees methods. The TreeLearn code and all datasets that were created in the course of this work are made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Binary-weight Neural Networks (BNNs), in which weights are binarized and activations are quantized, are employed to reduce computational costs of various kinds of applications. In this paper, a design methodology of hardware architecture for inference engines is proposed to handle modern BNNs with two operation modes. Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations can be simplified by replacing multiply operations with bitwise operations. The proposed method can effectively reduce the gate count of inference engines by removing a part of computational costs from the hardware system. The architecture of MAC operations can calculate the inference results of BNNs efficiently with only 52% of hardware costs compared with the related works. To show that the inference engine can handle practical applications, two lightweight networks which combine the backbones of SegNeXt and the decoder of SparseInst for instance segmentation are also proposed. The output results of the lightweight networks are computed using only bitwise operations and add operations. The proposed inference engine has lower hardware costs than related works. The experimental results show that the proposed inference engine can handle the proposed instance-segmentation networks and achieves higher accuracy than YOLACT on the "Person" category although the model size is 77.7$\times$ smaller compared with YOLACT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for CVPR 2024 workshop (Embedded Vision Workshop)</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, creating such a representation poses challenges due to sensor noise, instance segmentation and tracking errors, and the objects' dynamic motion. This paper introduces a novel particle-based instance-aware semantic occupancy map to tackle these challenges. Particles with an augmented instance state are used to estimate the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) of the objects and implicitly model the environment. Utilizing a State-augmented Sequential Monte Carlo PHD (S$^2$MC-PHD) filter, these particles are updated to jointly estimate occupancy status, semantic, and instance IDs, mitigating noise. Additionally, a memory module is adopted to enhance the map's responsiveness to previously observed objects. Experimental results on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics under different noise conditions. Subsequent tests using real-world data further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, RGB-D segmentation-leveraging both visual and depth cues-has attracted increasing attention as it promises richer scene understanding than RGB-only methods. However, most existing efforts have primarily focused on semantic segmentation and thus leave a critical gap. There is a relative scarcity of instance-level RGB-D segmentation datasets, which restricts current methods to broad category distinctions rather than fully capturing the fine-grained details required for recognizing individual objects. To bridge this gap, we introduce three RGB-D instance segmentation benchmarks, distinguished at the instance level. These datasets are versatile, supporting a wide range of applications from indoor navigation to robotic manipulation. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of various baseline models on these benchmarks. This comprehensive analysis identifies both their strengths and shortcomings, guiding future work toward more robust, generalizable solutions. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective method for RGB-D data integration. Extensive evaluations affirm the effectiveness of our approach, offering a robust framework for advancing toward more nuanced scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CompetitorFormer: Competitor Transformer for 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14179v3)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have become the dominant approach for 3D instance segmentation. These methods predict instance masks via instance queries, ranking them by classification confidence and IoU scores to select the top prediction as the final outcome. However, it has been observed that the current models employ a fixed and higher number of queries than the instances present within a scene. In such instances, multiple queries predict the same instance, yet only a single query is ultimately optimized. The close scores of queries in the lower-level decoders make it challenging for the dominant query to distinguish itself rapidly, which ultimately impairs the model's accuracy and convergence efficiency. This phenomenon is referred to as inter-query competition. To address this challenge, we put forth a series of plug-and-play competition-oriented designs, collectively designated as the CompetitorFormer, with the aim of reducing competition and facilitating a dominant query. Experiments showed that integrating our designs with state-of-the-art frameworks consistently resulted in significant performance improvements in 3D instance segmentation across a range of datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution to address this challenging task. Our proposed method implements weighted non-local blocks (wNLB) in the feature extractor. This integration enables an inherent denoising process at the feature level. As a result, our method eliminates the need for aligned ground truth images during training, thus supporting training on real-world low-light datasets. We introduce additional learnable weights at each layer in order to enhance the network's adaptability to real-world noise characteristics, which affect different feature scales in different ways. Experimental results on several object detectors show that the proposed method outperforms the pretrained networks with an Average Precision (AP) improvement of at least +7.6, with the introduction of wNLB further enhancing AP by upto +1.3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Leverage Cross-Attention for End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01119v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction offers comprehensive scene understanding, enabling advances in embodied robotics and photorealistic simulation. In this paper, we propose PanopticRecon++, an end-to-end method that formulates panoptic reconstruction through a novel cross-attention perspective. This perspective models the relationship between 3D instances (as queries) and the scene's 3D embedding field (as keys) through their attention map. Unlike existing methods that separate the optimization of queries and keys or overlook spatial proximity, PanopticRecon++ introduces learnable 3D Gaussians as instance queries. This formulation injects 3D spatial priors to preserve proximity while maintaining end-to-end optimizability. Moreover, this query formulation facilitates the alignment of 2D open-vocabulary instance IDs across frames by leveraging optimal linear assignment with instance masks rendered from the queries. Additionally, we ensure semantic-instance segmentation consistency by fusing query-based instance segmentation probabilities with semantic probabilities in a novel panoptic head supervised by a panoptic loss. During training, the number of instance query tokens dynamically adapts to match the number of objects. PanopticRecon++ shows competitive performance in terms of 3D and 2D segmentation and reconstruction performance on both simulation and real-world datasets, and demonstrates a user case as a robot simulator.

In this study, we propose a novel Shape Guided Transformer Network (SGTN) to accurately extract objects at the instance level. Inspired by the global contextual modeling capacity of the self-attention mechanism, we propose an effective transformer encoder termed LSwin, which incorporates vertical and horizontal 1D global self-attention mechanisms to obtain better global-perception capacity for RSIs than the popular local-shifted-window based Swin Transformer. To achieve accurate instance mask segmentation, we introduce a shape guidance module (SGM) to emphasize the object boundary and shape information. The combination of SGM, which emphasizes the local detail information, and LSwin, which focuses on the global context relationships, achieve excellent RSI instance segmentation. Their effectiveness was validated through comprehensive ablation experiments. Especially, LSwin is proved better than the popular ResNet and Swin transformer encoder at the same level of efficiency. Compared to other instance segmentation methods, our SGTN achieves the highest average precision (AP) scores on two single-class public datasets (WHU dataset and BITCC dataset) and a multi-class public dataset (NWPU VHR-10 dataset).

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video.

However, the deployment of such models has been limited due to the expensive nature of dense data annotation, giving rise to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). A key challenge in panoptic UDA is reducing the domain gap between a labeled source and an unlabeled target domain while harmonizing the subtasks of semantic and instance segmentation to limit catastrophic interference. While considerable progress has been achieved, existing approaches mainly focus on the adaptation of semantic segmentation. In this work, we focus on incorporating instance-level adaptation via a novel instance-aware cross-domain mixing strategy IMix. IMix significantly enhances the panoptic quality by improving instance segmentation performance. Specifically, we propose inserting high-confidence predicted instances from the target domain onto source images, retaining the exhaustiveness of the resulting pseudo-labels while reducing the injected confirmation bias. Nevertheless, such an enhancement comes at the cost of degraded semantic performance, attributed to catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we regularize our semantic branch by employing CLIP-based domain alignment (CDA), exploiting the domain-robustness of natural language prompts. Finally, we present an end-to-end model incorporating these two mechanisms called LIDAPS, achieving state-of-the-art results on all popular panoptic UDA benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> | None |

The framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. Our framework enables real-time decentralized operations onboard robots, allowing them to leverage communication opportunistically. We integrate the proposed framework with the autonomous navigation and exploration systems of three types of aerial and ground robots, conducting extensive experiments in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. These experiments demonstrate its accuracy in inter-robot localization and object mapping, along with its moderate demands on computation, storage, and communication resources. The framework is open-sourced and is suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot metric-semantic SLAM applications.

The presence of pathologies, broken structures or limited field-of-view (FOV) can all make anatomy parsing algorithms vulnerable. In this work, we explore how to leverage and implement the successful detection-then-segmentation paradigm for 3D medical data, and propose a steerable, robust, and efficient computing framework for detection, identification, and segmentation of anatomies in CT scans. Considering the complicated shapes, sizes, and orientations of anatomies, without loss of generality, we present a nine degrees of freedom (9-DoF) pose estimation solution in full 3D space using a novel single-stage, non-hierarchical representation. Our whole framework is executed in a steerable manner where any anatomy of interest can be directly retrieved to further boost inference efficiency. We have validated our method on three medical imaging parsing tasks: ribs, spine, and abdominal organs. For rib parsing, CT scans have been annotated at the rib instance-level for quantitative evaluation, similarly for spine vertebrae and abdominal organs. Extensive experiments on 9-DoF box detection and rib instance segmentation demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness of our framework (with the identification rate of 97.0% and the segmentation Dice score of 90.9%), compared favorably against several strong baselines (e.g., CenterNet, FCOS, and nnU-Net). For spine parsing and abdominal multi-organ segmentation, our method achieves competitive results on par with state-of-the-art methods on the public CTSpine1K dataset and FLARE22 competition, respectively.

Machine learning (ML) methods for automatically extracting field boundaries from remotely sensed images could help realize the demand for these datasets at a global scale. However, current ML methods for field instance segmentation lack sufficient geographic coverage, accuracy, and generalization capabilities. Further, research on improving ML methods is restricted by the lack of labeled datasets representing the diversity of global agricultural fields. We present Fields of The World (FTW) -- a novel ML benchmark dataset for agricultural field instance segmentation spanning 24 countries on four continents (Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America). FTW is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets with 70,462 samples, each containing instance and semantic segmentation masks paired with multi-date, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. We provide results from baseline models for the new FTW benchmark, show that models trained on FTW have better zero-shot and fine-tuning performance in held-out countries than models that aren't pre-trained with diverse datasets, and show positive qualitative zero-shot results of FTW models in a real-world scenario -- running on Sentinel-2 scenes over Ethiopia.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI-2025 Artificial Intelligence for Social Impact (AISI) track</p></details> | None |

Typically, each box proposal or box query aims to directly maximize the intersection-over-union score with the ground truth, followed by a winner-takes-all non-maximum suppression where only the highest scoring box in each region is retained. We observe that both steps are sub-optimal: the first involves regressing proposals to the entire ground truth, which is a difficult task even with large receptive fields, and the second neglects valuable information from boxes other than the top candidate. Instead of regressing proposals to the whole ground truth, we propose a simpler approach: regress only to the area of intersection between the proposal and the ground truth. This avoids the need for proposals to extrapolate beyond their visual scope, improving localization accuracy. Rather than adopting a winner-takes-all strategy, we take the union over the regressed intersections of all boxes in a region to generate the final box outputs. Our plug-and-play method integrates seamlessly into proposal-based, grid-based, and query-based detection architectures with minimal modifications, consistently improving object localization and instance segmentation. We demonstrate its broad applicability and versatility across various detection and segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Progressive Fine-to-Coarse Reconstruction for Accurate Low-Bit Post-Training Quantization in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14633v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to its efficiency, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has been widely adopted for compressing Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, when quantized into low-bit representations, there is often a significant performance drop compared to their full-precision counterparts. To address this issue, reconstruction methods have been incorporated into the PTQ framework to improve performance in low-bit quantization settings. Nevertheless, existing related methods predefine the reconstruction granularity and seldom explore the progressive relationships between different reconstruction granularities, which leads to sub-optimal quantization results in ViTs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Progressive Fine-to-Coarse Reconstruction (PFCR) method for accurate PTQ, which significantly improves the performance of low-bit quantized vision transformers. Specifically, we define multi-head self-attention and multi-layer perceptron modules along with their shortcuts as the finest reconstruction units. After reconstructing these two fine-grained units, we combine them to form coarser blocks and reconstruct them at a coarser granularity level. We iteratively perform this combination and reconstruction process, achieving progressive fine-to-coarse reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a Progressive Optimization Strategy (POS) for PFCR to alleviate the difficulty of training, thereby further enhancing model performance. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the best Top-1 accuracy among state-of-the-art methods, particularly attaining 75.61% for 3-bit quantized ViT-B in PTQ. Besides, quantization results on the COCO dataset reveal the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed method on other computer vision tasks like object detection and instance segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methodologies for 3D semantic and instance segmentation, such as KpConv, RandLA, Mask3D, etc., are designed to train on extensive labeled datasets to obtain satisfactory performance in practical tasks. This requirement presents a significant challenge, given the inherent scarcity of manually annotated 3D datasets, particularly for the military use cases. Recognizing this gap, our previous research leverages the One World Terrain data repository manually annotated databases, as showcased at IITSEC 2019 and 2021, to enrich the training dataset for deep learning models. However, collecting and annotating large scale 3D data for specific tasks remains costly and inefficient. To this end, the objective of this research is to design and develop a comprehensive and efficient framework for 3D segmentation tasks to assist in 3D data annotation. This framework integrates Grounding DINO and Segment anything Model, augmented by an enhancement in 2D image rendering via 3D mesh. Furthermore, the authors have also developed a user friendly interface that facilitates the 3D annotation process, offering intuitive visualization of rendered images and the 3D point cloud.</p></details> |  | None |

Lesion scores made by renal pathologists are semi-quantitative and exhibit high inter-observer variability. Automating lesion classification within segmented anatomical structures can provide decision support in quantification analysis, thereby reducing inter-observer variability. Nevertheless, classifying lesions in regions-of-interest (ROIs) is clinically challenging due to (a) a large amount of densely packed anatomical objects, (b) class imbalance across different compartments (at least 3), (c) significant variation in size and shape of anatomical objects and (d) the presence of multi-label lesions per anatomical structure. Existing models cannot address these complexities in an efficient and generic manner. This paper presents an analysis for a \textbf{generalized solution} to datasets from various sources (pathology departments) with different types of lesions. Our approach utilizes two sub-networks: dense instance segmentation and lesion classification. We introduce \textbf{DiffRegFormer}, an end-to-end dense instance segmentation sub-network designed for multi-class, multi-scale objects within ROIs. Combining diffusion models, transformers, and RCNNs, DiffRegFormer {is a computational-friendly framework that can efficiently recognize over 500 objects across three anatomical classes, i.e., glomeruli, tubuli, and arteries, within ROIs.} In a dataset of 303 ROIs from 148 Jones' silver-stained renal Whole Slide Images (WSIs), our approach outperforms previous methods, achieving an Average Precision of 52.1\% (detection) and 46.8\% (segmentation). Moreover, our lesion classification sub-network achieves 89.2\% precision and 64.6\% recall on 21889 object patches out of the 303 ROIs. Lastly, our model demonstrates direct domain transfer to PAS-stained renal WSIs without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a novel task called zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation, aimed at identifying aerial objects that are absent from training data. Challenges arise when classifying aerial categories with high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Besides, the domain gap between vision-language models' pretraining datasets and remote sensing datasets hinders the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained model when it is directly applied to remote sensing images. To address these challenges, we propose a $\textbf{Z}$ero-Sh$\textbf{o}$t $\textbf{R}$emote Sensing $\textbf{I}$nstance Segmentation framework, dubbed $\textbf{ZoRI}$. Our approach features a discrimination-enhanced classifier that uses refined textual embeddings to increase the awareness of class disparities. Instead of direct fine-tuning, we propose a knowledge-maintained adaptation strategy that decouples semantic-related information to preserve the pretrained vision-language alignment while adjusting features to capture remote sensing domain-specific visual cues. Additionally, we introduce a prior-injected prediction with cache bank of aerial visual prototypes to supplement the semantic richness of text embeddings and seamlessly integrate aerial representations, adapting to the remote sensing domain. We establish new experimental protocols and benchmarks, and extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate that ZoRI achieves the state-of-art performance on the zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation task.

While recent years have seen advances in digital documentation methods, vast amounts of legacy data remain locked in traditional publications. This paper introduces PyPotteryLens, an open-source framework that leverages deep learning to automate the digitisation and processing of archaeological pottery drawings from published sources. The system combines state-of-the-art computer vision models (YOLO for instance segmentation and EfficientNetV2 for classification) with an intuitive user interface, making advanced digital methods accessible to archaeologists regardless of technical expertise. The framework achieves over 97\% precision and recall in pottery detection and classification tasks, while reducing processing time by up to 5x to 20x compared to manual methods. Testing across diverse archaeological contexts demonstrates robust generalisation capabilities. Also, the system's modular architecture facilitates extension to other archaeological materials, while its standardised output format ensures long-term preservation and reusability of digitised data as well as solid basis for training machine learning algorithms.

While earlier work studied general-purpose image datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and simple tasks like image recognition, we investigated geo-biases in real-world driving datasets on a more complex task: instance segmentation. We examined if instance segmentation models trained on European driving scenes (Eurocentric models) are geo-biased. Consistent with previous work, we found that Eurocentric models were geo-biased. Interestingly, we found that geo-biases came from classification errors rather than localization errors, with classification errors alone contributing 10-90% of the geo-biases in segmentation and 19-88% of the geo-biases in detection. This showed that while classification is geo-biased, localization (including detection and segmentation) is geographically robust. Our findings show that in region-specific models (e.g., Eurocentric models), geo-biases from classification errors can be significantly mitigated by using coarser classes (e.g., grouping car, bus, and truck as 4-wheeler).</p></details> |  | None |

However, ViTs are computationally expensive and not well suited for mobile devices; this led to the prevalence of convolutional neural network (CNN) and ViT-based hybrid models for mobile vision applications. Recently, Vision GNN (ViG) and CNN hybrid models have also been proposed for mobile vision tasks. However, all of these methods remain slower compared to pure CNN-based models. In this work, we propose Multi-Level Dilated Convolutions to devise a purely CNN-based mobile backbone. Using Multi-Level Dilated Convolutions allows for a larger theoretical receptive field than standard convolutions. Different levels of dilation also allow for interactions between the short-range and long-range features in an image. Experiments show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mobile CNN, ViT, ViG, and hybrid architectures in terms of accuracy and/or speed on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Our fastest model, RapidNet-Ti, achieves 76.3\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 0.9 ms inference latency on an iPhone 13 mini NPU, which is faster and more accurate than MobileNetV2x1.4 (74.7\% top-1 with 1.0 ms latency).

It has proven to be a powerful tool for the preliminary training of Vision Transformers (ViTs), yielding impressive results across various tasks. Nevertheless, most MIM methods heavily depend on the random masking strategy to formulate the pretext task. This strategy necessitates numerous trials to ascertain the optimal dropping ratio, which can be resource-intensive, requiring the model to be pre-trained for anywhere between 800 to 1600 epochs. Furthermore, this approach may not be suitable for all datasets. In this work, we propose a new masking strategy that effectively helps the model capture global and local features. Based on this masking strategy, SymMIM, our proposed training pipeline for MIM is introduced. SymMIM achieves a new SOTA accuracy of 85.9\% on ImageNet using ViT-Large and surpasses previous SOTA across downstream tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation tasks, and so on.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the pairwise token affinity and complex matrix operations limit its deployment on resource-constrained scenarios and real-time applications, such as mobile devices, although considerable efforts have been made in previous works. In this paper, we introduce CAS-ViT: Convolutional Additive Self-attention Vision Transformers, to achieve a balance between efficiency and performance in mobile applications. Firstly, we argue that the capability of token mixers to obtain global contextual information hinges on multiple information interactions, such as spatial and channel domains. Subsequently, we propose Convolutional Additive Token Mixer (CATM) employing underlying spatial and channel attention as novel interaction forms. This module eliminates troublesome complex operations such as matrix multiplication and Softmax. We introduce Convolutional Additive Self-attention(CAS) block hybrid architecture and utilize CATM for each block. And further, we build a family of lightweight networks, which can be easily extended to various downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate CAS-ViT across a variety of vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Our M and T model achieves 83.0\%/84.1\% top-1 with only 12M/21M parameters on ImageNet-1K. Meanwhile, throughput evaluations on GPUs, ONNX, and iPhones also demonstrate superior results compared to other state-of-the-art backbones.

While recent approaches focus solely on efficient feature context modeling for channel attention, we aim to model both channel and spatial attention comprehensively with minimal parameters and reduced computation. Leveraging the principles of relational modeling in graphs, we introduce a constant-parameter module, STEAM: Squeeze and Transform Enhanced Attention Module, which integrates channel and spatial attention to enhance the representation power of CNNs. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a graph-based approach for modeling both channel and spatial attention, utilizing concepts from multi-head graph transformers. Additionally, we introduce Output Guided Pooling (OGP), which efficiently captures spatial context to further enhance spatial attention. We extensively evaluate STEAM for large-scale image classification, object detection and instance segmentation on standard benchmark datasets.

Hence, automated detection of these artefacts is highly beneficial, especially with the increasing amounts of data gathered. Machine learning methods are well-suited to this problem, but currently there is a lack of annotated data to train such approaches to detect artefacts in astronomical observations. In this work, we present a dataset of images from the XMM-Newton space telescope Optical Monitoring camera showing different types of artefacts. We hand-annotated a sample of 1000 images with artefacts which we use to train automated ML methods. We further demonstrate techniques tailored for accurate detection and masking of artefacts using instance segmentation. We adopt a hybrid approach, combining knowledge from both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models and use their advantages in segmentation. The presented method and dataset will advance artefact detection in astronomical observations by providing a reproducible baseline.

It requires to detect, segment, track and describe with rich captions never before seen objects. This challenging task can be addressed by developing "abstractors" which connect a vision model and a language foundation model. Concretely, we connect a multi-scale visual feature extractor and a large language model (LLM) by developing an object abstractor and an object-to-text abstractor. The object abstractor, consisting of a prompt encoder and transformer blocks, introduces spatially-diverse open-world object queries to discover never before seen objects in videos. An inter-query contrastive loss further encourages the diversity of object queries. The object-to-text abstractor is augmented with masked cross-attention and acts as a bridge between the object queries and a frozen LLM to generate rich and descriptive object-centric captions for each detected object. Our generalized approach surpasses the baseline that jointly addresses the tasks of open-world video instance segmentation and dense video object captioning by 13% on never before seen objects, and by 10% on object-centric captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://anwesachoudhuri.github.io/OpenWorldVISCap/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://anwesachoudhuri.github.io/OpenWorldVISCap) |

Recent advancements in generative AI, including text-to-3D and image-to-3D methods, have dramatically reduced the complexity and cost of this process. However, current techniques for editing complex 3D scenes continue to rely on generally interactive multi-step, 2D-to-3D projection methods and diffusion-based techniques, which often lack precision in control and hamper real-time performance. In this work, we propose 3DSceneEditor, a fully 3D-based paradigm for real-time, precise editing of intricate 3D scenes using Gaussian Splatting. Unlike conventional methods, 3DSceneEditor operates through a streamlined 3D pipeline, enabling direct manipulation of Gaussians for efficient, high-quality edits based on input prompts.The proposed framework (i) integrates a pre-trained instance segmentation model for semantic labeling; (ii) employs a zero-shot grounding approach with CLIP to align target objects with user prompts; and (iii) applies scene modifications, such as object addition, repositioning, recoloring, replacing, and deletion directly on Gaussians. Extensive experimental results show that 3DSceneEditor achieves superior editing precision and speed with respect to current SOTA 3D scene editing approaches, establishing a new benchmark for efficient and interactive 3D scene customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ziyangyan.github.io/3DSceneEditor</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ziyangyan.github.io/3DSceneEditor) |

It significantly contributes to the development of CV algorithms due to its frequent presence in datasets across various applications, ranging from classification and instance segmentation to 3D reconstruction. The polymorphic shapes and textures of food, coupled with high variation in forms and vast multimodal information, including language descriptions and nutritional data, make food computing a complex and demanding task for modern CV algorithms. 3D food modeling is a new frontier for addressing food related problems, due to its inherent capability to deal with random camera views and its straightforward representation for calculating food portion size. However, the primary hurdle in the development of algorithms for food object analysis is the lack of nutrition values in existing 3D datasets. Moreover, in the broader field of 3D research, there is a critical need for domain-specific test datasets. To bridge the gap between general 3D vision and food computing research, we introduce MetaFood3D. This dataset consists of 743 meticulously scanned and labeled 3D food objects across 131 categories, featuring detailed nutrition information, weight, and food codes linked to a comprehensive nutrition database. Our MetaFood3D dataset emphasizes intra-class diversity and includes rich modalities such as textured mesh files, RGB-D videos, and segmentation masks. Experimental results demonstrate our dataset's strong capabilities in enhancing food portion estimation algorithms, highlight the gap between video captures and 3D scanned data, and showcase the strengths of MetaFood3D in generating synthetic eating occasion data and 3D food objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The dataset is available at https://lorenz.ecn.purdue.edu/~food3d/</p></details> | None |

This model, trained on a mixed dataset of dormant and canopy season apple orchard images, aimed to enhance the segmentation of tree trunks and branches under varying seasonal conditions throughout the year. The model was individually validated across dormant and canopy season images after training the YOLO11-CBAM on the mixed dataset collected over the two seasons. Additional testing of the model during pre-bloom, flower bloom, fruit thinning, and harvest season was performed. The highest recall and precision metrics were observed in the YOLO11x-seg-CBAM and YOLO11m-seg-CBAM respectively. Particularly, YOLO11m-seg with CBAM showed the highest precision of 0.83 as performed for the Trunk class in training, while without the CBAM, YOLO11m-seg achieved 0.80 precision score for the Trunk class. Likewise, for branch class, YOLO11m-seg with CBAM achieved the highest precision score value of 0.75 while without the CBAM, the YOLO11m-seg achieved a precision of 0.73. For dormant season validation, YOLO11x-seg exhibited the highest precision at 0.91. Canopy season validation highlighted YOLO11s-seg with superior precision across all classes, achieving 0.516 for Branch, and 0.64 for Trunk. The modeling approach, trained on two season datasets as dormant and canopy season images, demonstrated the potential of the YOLO11-CBAM integration to effectively detect and segment tree trunks and branches year-round across all seasonal variations.

We present a practical, training-free framework that makes precise video colour editing accessible through an intuitive interface while maintaining professional-quality output. Our key insight is that by decoupling spatial and temporal aspects of colour editing, we can better align with users' natural workflow -- allowing them to focus on precise colour selection in key frames before automatically propagating changes across time. We achieve this through a novel technical framework that combines: (i) a simple point-and-click interface merging grid-based colour selection with automatic instance segmentation for precise spatial control, (ii) bidirectional colour propagation that leverages inherent video motion patterns, and (iii) motion-aware blending that ensures smooth transitions even with complex object movements. Through extensive evaluation on diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods while eliminating the need for training or specialized hardware, making professional-quality video colour editing accessible to everyone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at https://chaitron.github.io/DreamColour-demo</p></details> | [Code Link](https://chaitron.github.io/DreamColour-demo) |

We analyze the computational bottlenecks of state-of-the-art foundation models that performs OV-VIS, and propose a new method, TROY-VIS, that significantly improves processing speed while maintaining high accuracy. We introduce three key techniques: (1) Decoupled Attention Feature Enhancer to speed up information interaction between different modalities and scales; (2) Flash Embedding Memory for obtaining fast text embeddings of object categories; and, (3) Kernel Interpolation for exploiting the temporal continuity in videos. Our experiments demonstrate that TROY-VIS achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and speed on two large-scale OV-VIS benchmarks, BURST and LV-VIS, running 20x faster than GLEE-Lite (25 FPS v.s. 1.25 FPS) with comparable or even better accuracy.

The current prevailing method, full fine-tuning, suffers from the issue of knowledge forgetting as it focuses solely on fitting the downstream training set. In this paper, we propose a novel weight rollback-based fine-tuning method called OLOR (One step Learning, One step Review). OLOR combines fine-tuning with optimizers, incorporating a weight rollback term into the weight update term at each step. This ensures consistency in the weight range of upstream and downstream models, effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance. In addition, a layer-wise penalty is presented to employ penalty decay and the diversified decay rate to adjust the weight rollback levels of layers for adapting varying downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation, we demonstrate the general applicability and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed OLOR.

However, it's traditionally performed by human-supervised methods that often require manual counting, making it tedious and time-consuming. Previous research suggests automating this task using computer vision and machine learning methods, primarily through instance segmentation or density estimation techniques. This study conducts a comparative analysis of vision transformers (ViTs) for weakly-supervised counting in microorganism enumeration, contrasting them with traditional architectures such as ResNet and investigating ViT-based models such as TransCrowd. We trained different versions of ViTs as the architectural backbone for feature extraction using four microbiology datasets to determine potential new approaches for total microorganism enumeration in images. Results indicate that while ResNets perform better overall, ViTs performance demonstrates competent results across all datasets, opening up promising lines of research in microorganism enumeration. This comparative study contributes to the field of microbial image analysis by presenting innovative approaches to the recurring challenge of microorganism enumeration and by highlighting the capabilities of ViTs in the task of regression counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> | None |

While several deep neural network models have been proposed to tackle those tasks, augmentation methods for COD and CIS have not been thoroughly explored. Augmentation strategies can help improve models' performance by increasing the size and diversity of the training data and exposing the model to a wider range of variations in the data. Besides, we aim to automatically learn transformations that help to reveal the underlying structure of camouflaged objects and allow the model to learn to better identify and segment camouflaged objects. To achieve this, we propose a learnable augmentation method in the frequency domain for COD and CIS via the Fourier transform approach, dubbed CamoFA. Our method leverages a conditional generative adversarial network and cross-attention mechanism to generate a reference image and an adaptive hybrid swapping with parameters to mix the low-frequency component of the reference image and the high-frequency component of the input image. This approach aims to make camouflaged objects more visible for detection and segmentation models. Without bells and whistles, our proposed augmentation method boosts the performance of camouflaged object detectors and instance segmenters by large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> | None |

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks.

However, the synthetic framework is usually designed with meticulous human effort for each task due to various requirements on image layout, content, and annotation formats, restricting the application of synthetic data on more general scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnySynth, a unified framework integrating adaptable, comprehensive, and highly controllable components capable of generating an arbitrary type of synthetic data given diverse requirements. Specifically, the Task-Specific Layout Generation Module is first introduced to produce reasonable layouts for different tasks by leveraging the generation ability of large language models and layout priors of real-world images. A Uni-Controlled Image Generation Module is then developed to create high-quality synthetic images that are controllable and based on the generated layouts. In addition, user specific reference images, and style images can be incorporated into the generation to task requirements. Finally, the Task-Oriented Annotation Module offers precise and detailed annotations for the generated images across different tasks. We have validated our framework's performance across various tasks, including Few-shot Object Detection, Cross-domain Object Detection, Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval, and Multi-modal Image Perception and Grounding. The specific data synthesized by our framework significantly improves model performance in these tasks, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end several token pruning and merging approaches have been proposed that improve efficiency by successively reducing the number of tokens. However, it remains an open problem to design a token reduction method that is fast, maintains high performance, and is applicable to various vision tasks. In this work, we present a token pruner that uses auxiliary prediction heads that learn to select tokens end-to-end based on task relevance. These auxiliary heads can be removed after training, leading to throughput close to that of a random pruner. We evaluate our method on image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation, and show speedups of 1.5 to 4x with small drops in performance. As a best case, on the ADE20k semantic segmentation benchmark, we observe a 2x speedup relative to the no-pruning baseline, with a negligible performance penalty of 0.1 median mIoU across 5 seeds.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures | None |

Despite harvesting remarkable progress, existing works follow asynchronous designs, which model video sequences via either video-level queries only or adopting query-sensitive cascade structures, resulting in difficulties when handling complex and challenging video scenarios. In this work, we analyze the cause of this phenomenon and the limitations of the current solutions, and propose to conduct synchronized modeling via a new framework named SyncVIS. Specifically, SyncVIS explicitly introduces video-level query embeddings and designs two key modules to synchronize video-level query with frame-level query embeddings: a synchronized video-frame modeling paradigm and a synchronized embedding optimization strategy. The former attempts to promote the mutual learning of frame- and video-level embeddings with each other and the latter divides large video sequences into small clips for easier optimization. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the challenging YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021 & 2022, and OVIS benchmarks and SyncVIS achieves state-of-the-art results, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

However, existing upsamplers either lack specific feature guidance or necessitate the utilization of high-resolution feature maps, resulting in a loss of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we find that the local self-attention naturally has the feature guidance capability, and its computational paradigm aligns closely with the essence of feature upsampling (\ie feature reassembly of neighboring points). Therefore, we introduce local self-attention into the upsampling task and demonstrate that the majority of existing upsamplers can be regarded as special cases of upsamplers based on local self-attention. Considering the potential semantic gap between upsampled points and their neighboring points, we further introduce the deformation mechanism into the upsampler based on local self-attention, thereby proposing LDA-AQU. As a novel dynamic kernel-based upsampler, LDA-AQU utilizes the feature of queries to guide the model in adaptively adjusting the position and aggregation weight of neighboring points, thereby meeting the upsampling requirements across various complex scenarios. In addition, LDA-AQU is lightweight and can be easily integrated into various model architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of LDA-AQU across four dense prediction tasks: object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and semantic segmentation. LDA-AQU consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art upsamplers, achieving performance enhancements of 1.7 AP, 1.5 AP, 2.0 PQ, and 2.5 mIoU compared to the baseline models in the aforementioned four tasks, respectively.

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach, combining explicit modeling with neural adaptability to provide efficient and detailed scene representations. However, three major challenges remain in leveraging 3DGS for scene understanding: 1) an imbalance between appearance and semantics, where dense Gaussian usage for fine-grained texture modeling does not align with the minimal requirements for semantic attributes; 2) inconsistencies between appearance and semantics, as purely appearance-based Gaussians often misrepresent object boundaries; and 3) reliance on top-down instance segmentation methods, which struggle with uneven category distributions, leading to over- or under-segmentation. In this work, we propose InstanceGaussian, a method that jointly learns appearance and semantic features while adaptively aggregating instances. Our contributions include: i) a novel Semantic-Scaffold-GS representation balancing appearance and semantics to improve feature representations and boundary delineation; ii) a progressive appearance-semantic joint training strategy to enhance stability and segmentation accuracy; and iii) a bottom-up, category-agnostic instance aggregation approach that addresses segmentation challenges through farthest point sampling and connected component analysis.

With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems.

However, the segmentation of C. elegans remains challenging due to the following reasons: 1) the activity trajectory of C. elegans is uncontrollable, and multiple nematodes often overlap, resulting in blurred boundaries of C. elegans. This makes it impossible to clearly study the life trajectory of a certain nematode; and 2) in the microscope images of overlapping C. elegans, the translucent tissues at the edges obscure each other, leading to inaccurate boundary segmentation. To solve these problems, a Bilayer Segmentation-Recombination Network (BR-Net) for the segmentation of C. elegans instances is proposed. The network consists of three parts: A Coarse Mask Segmentation Module (CMSM), a Bilayer Segmentation Module (BSM), and a Semantic Consistency Recombination Module (SCRM). The CMSM is used to extract the coarse mask, and we introduce a Unified Attention Module (UAM) in CMSM to make CMSM better aware of nematode instances. The Bilayer Segmentation Module (BSM) segments the aggregated C. elegans into overlapping and non-overlapping regions. This is followed by integration by the SCRM, where semantic consistency regularization is introduced to segment nematode instances more accurately. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified on the C. elegans dataset. The experimental results show that BR-Net exhibits good competitiveness and outperforms other recently proposed instance segmentation methods in processing C. elegans occlusion images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing lightweight Mamba-based backbones cannot demonstrate performance that matches Convolution or Transformer-based methods. We observe that simply modifying the scanning path in the image domain is not conducive to fully exploiting the potential of vision Mamba. In this paper, we first perform comprehensive spectral and quantitative analyses, and verify that the Mamba block mainly models low-frequency information under Convolution-Mamba hybrid architecture. Based on the analyses, we introduce a novel Laplace mixer to decouple the features in terms of frequency and input only the low-frequency components into the Mamba block. In addition, considering the redundancy of the features and the different requirements for high-frequency details and low-frequency global information at different stages, we introduce a frequency ramp inception, i.e., gradually reduce the input dimensions of the high-frequency branches, so as to efficiently trade-off the high-frequency and low-frequency components at different layers. By integrating mobile-friendly convolution and efficient Laplace mixer, we build a series of tiny hybrid vision Mamba called TinyViM. The proposed TinyViM achieves impressive performance on several downstream tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation. In particular, TinyViM outperforms Convolution, Transformer and Mamba-based models with similar scales, and the throughput is about 2-3 times higher than that of other Mamba-based models.

However, linking these entities across diverse maps remains a persistent challenge for researchers. Traditionally, this has been addressed through a two-step process: detecting entities within individual maps and then associating them via a heuristic-based post-processing step. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines segmentation and association of geographic entities in historical maps using video instance segmentation (VIS). This method significantly streamlines geographic entity alignment and enhances automation. However, acquiring high-quality, video-format training data for VIS models is prohibitively expensive, especially for historical maps that often contain hundreds or thousands of geographic entities. To mitigate this challenge, we explore self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to enhance VIS performance on historical maps. We evaluate the performance of VIS models under different pretraining configurations and introduce a novel method for generating synthetic videos from unlabeled historical map images for pretraining. Our proposed self-supervised VIS method substantially reduces the need for manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed self-supervised VIS approach, achieving a 24.9\% improvement in AP and a 0.23 increase in F1 score compared to the model trained from scratch.</p></details> |  | None |

Only recently, novel approaches have emerged tackling this problem in an unsupervised fashion. Generally, these approaches first generate pseudo-masks and then train a class-agnostic detector. While such methods deliver the current state of the art, they often fail to correctly separate instances overlapping in 2D image space since only semantics are considered. To tackle this issue, we instead propose to cut the semantic masks in 3D to obtain the final 2D instances by utilizing a point cloud representation of the scene. Furthermore, we derive a Spatial Importance function, which we use to resharpen the semantics along the 3D borders of instances. Nevertheless, these pseudo-masks are still subject to mask ambiguity. To address this issue, we further propose to augment the training of a class-agnostic detector with three Spatial Confidence components aiming to isolate a clean learning signal. With these contributions, our approach outperforms competing methods across multiple standard benchmarks for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learn from Foundation Model: Fruit Detection Model without Manual Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16196v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large foundation models have enabled the possibility of transferring knowledge pre-trained on vast datasets to domains with limited data availability. Agriculture is one of the domains that lacks sufficient data. This study proposes a framework to train effective, domain-specific, small models from foundation models without manual annotation. Our approach begins with SDM (Segmentation-Description-Matching), a stage that leverages two foundation models: SAM2 (Segment Anything in Images and Videos) for segmentation and OpenCLIP (Open Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) for zero-shot open-vocabulary classification. In the second stage, a novel knowledge distillation mechanism is utilized to distill compact, edge-deployable models from SDM, enhancing both inference speed and perception accuracy. The complete method, termed SDM-D (Segmentation-Description-Matching-Distilling), demonstrates strong performance across various fruit detection tasks object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation) without manual annotation. It nearly matches the performance of models trained with abundant labels. Notably, SDM-D outperforms open-set detection methods such as Grounding SAM and YOLO-World on all tested fruit detection datasets. Additionally, we introduce MegaFruits, a comprehensive fruit segmentation dataset encompassing over 25,000 images, and all code and datasets are made publicly available at https://github.com/AgRoboticsResearch/SDM-D.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/AgRoboticsResearch/SDM-D.git) |
| **[Any3DIS: Class-Agnostic 3D Instance Segmentation by 2D Mask Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16183v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 3D instance segmentation methods frequently encounter issues with over-segmentation, leading to redundant and inaccurate 3D proposals that complicate downstream tasks. This challenge arises from their unsupervised merging approach, where dense 2D instance masks are lifted across frames into point clouds to form 3D candidate proposals without direct supervision. These candidates are then hierarchically merged based on heuristic criteria, often resulting in numerous redundant segments that fail to combine into precise 3D proposals. To overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D-Aware 2D Mask Tracking module that uses robust 3D priors from a 2D mask segmentation and tracking foundation model (SAM-2) to ensure consistent object masks across video frames. Rather than merging all visible superpoints across views to create a 3D mask, our 3D Mask Optimization module leverages a dynamic programming algorithm to select an optimal set of views, refining the superpoints to produce a final 3D proposal for each object. Our approach achieves comprehensive object coverage within the scene while reducing unnecessary proposals, which could otherwise impair downstream applications. Evaluations on ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ confirm the effectiveness of our method, with improvements across Class-Agnostic, Open-Vocabulary, and Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://any3dis.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient 3D Instance Mapping and Localization with Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19797v5)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the problem of learning an implicit scene representation for 3D instance segmentation from a sequence of posed RGB images. Towards this, we introduce 3DIML, a novel framework that efficiently learns a neural label field which can render 3D instance segmentation masks from novel viewpoints. Opposed to prior art that optimizes a neural field in a self-supervised manner, requiring complicated training procedures and loss function design, 3DIML leverages a two-phase process. The first phase, InstanceMap, takes as input 2D segmentation masks of the image sequence generated by a frontend instance segmentation model, and associates corresponding masks across images to 3D labels. These almost 3D-consistent pseudolabel masks are then used in the second phase, InstanceLift, to supervise the training of a neural label field, which interpolates regions missed by InstanceMap and resolves ambiguities. Additionally, we introduce InstanceLoc, which enables near realtime localization of instance masks given a trained neural label field. We evaluate 3DIML on sequences from the Replica and ScanNet datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness under mild assumptions for the image sequences. We achieve a large practical speedup over existing implicit scene representation methods with comparable quality, showcasing its potential to facilitate faster and more effective 3D scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving Weakly-supervised Video Instance Segmentation by Leveraging Spatio-temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16661v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods has improved significantly with the advent of transformer networks. However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-Cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-Video Instance Segmentation (YouTube-VIS) 2019/2021 and Occluded Video Instance Segmentation (OVIS) datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

| **[Depth-Wise Convolutions in Vision Transformers for Efficient Training on Small Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19394v4)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) leverages the Transformer's encoder to capture global information by dividing images into patches and achieves superior performance across various computer vision tasks. However, the self-attention mechanism of ViT captures the global context from the outset, overlooking the inherent relationships between neighboring pixels in images or videos. Transformers mainly focus on global information while ignoring the fine-grained local details. Consequently, ViT lacks inductive bias during image or video dataset training. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with their reliance on local filters, possess an inherent inductive bias, making them more efficient and quicker to converge than ViT with less data. In this paper, we present a lightweight Depth-Wise Convolution module as a shortcut in ViT models, bypassing entire Transformer blocks to ensure the models capture both local and global information with minimal overhead. Additionally, we introduce two architecture variants, allowing the Depth-Wise Convolution modules to be applied to multiple Transformer blocks for parameter savings, and incorporating independent parallel Depth-Wise Convolution modules with different kernels to enhance the acquisition of local information. The proposed approach significantly boosts the performance of ViT models on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation by a large margin, especially on small datasets, as evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet for image classification, and COCO for object detection and instance segmentation.

| **[Con4m: Context-aware Consistency Learning Framework for Segmented Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00041v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Classification (TSC) encompasses two settings: classifying entire sequences or classifying segmented subsequences. The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of Con4m in handling segmented TSC tasks on MVD.</p></details> |  | None |
