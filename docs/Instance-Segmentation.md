| **[Synthetic Data Augmentation for Enhanced Chicken Carcass Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18558v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic, automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts, and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for journal reviewing</p></details> | None |
| **[GVCCS: A Dataset for Contrail Identification and Tracking on Visible Whole Sky Camera Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18330v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CutS3D: Cutting Semantics in 3D for 2D Unsupervised Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16319v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, algorithms that learn to segment object instances in 2D images have heavily relied on large amounts of human-annotated data. Only recently, novel approaches have emerged tackling this problem in an unsupervised fashion. Generally, these approaches first generate pseudo-masks and then train a class-agnostic detector. While such methods deliver the current state of the art, they often fail to correctly separate instances overlapping in 2D image space since only semantics are considered. To tackle this issue, we instead propose to cut the semantic masks in 3D to obtain the final 2D instances by utilizing a point cloud representation of the scene. Furthermore, we derive a Spatial Importance function, which we use to resharpen the semantics along the 3D borders of instances. Nevertheless, these pseudo-masks are still subject to mask ambiguity. To address this issue, we further propose to augment the training of a class-agnostic detector with three Spatial Confidence components aiming to isolate a clean learning signal. With these contributions, our approach outperforms competing methods across multiple standard benchmarks for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

| **[ROADWork Dataset: Learning to Recognize, Observe, Analyze and Drive Through Work Zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07661v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving and autonomously navigating through work zones is a challenging and underexplored problem. Open datasets for this long-tailed scenario are scarce. We propose the ROADWork dataset to learn to recognize, observe, analyze, and drive through work zones. State-of-the-art foundation models fail when applied to work zones. Fine-tuning models on our dataset significantly improves perception and navigation in work zones. With ROADWork dataset, we discover new work zone images with higher precision (+32.5%) at a much higher rate (12.8$\times$) around the world. Open-vocabulary methods fail too, whereas fine-tuned detectors improve performance (+32.2 AP). Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to describe work zones, but fine-tuning substantially improves performance (+36.7 SPICE). Beyond fine-tuning, we show the value of simple techniques. Video label propagation provides additional gains (+2.6 AP) for instance segmentation. While reading work zone signs, composing a detector and text spotter via crop-scaling improves performance +14.2% 1-NED). Composing work zone detections to provide context further reduces hallucinations (+3.9 SPICE) in VLMs. We predict navigational goals and compute drivable paths from work zone videos. Incorporating road work semantics ensures 53.6% goals have angular error (AE) < 0.5 (+9.9 %) and 75.3% pathways have AE < 0.5 (+8.1 %).</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> | None |
| **[A2Mamba: Attention-augmented State Space Models for Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16624v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing, have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while having 40% less parameters.

However, robust performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge. Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel, multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of temporal information across entire procedures. We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware, context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support future research in surgical scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cha...</summary><p>A challenge report pre-print containing 36 pages, 15 figures, and 13 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Geometric and Textural Consistency 3D Scene Generation via Single Image-guided Model Generation and Layout Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14841v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, 3D generation has made great strides in both academia and industry. However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets. Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input. Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages in scene layout synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, Project page: https://xdlbw.github.io/sing3d/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://xdlbw.github.io/sing3d) |
| **[SlideSLAM: Sparse, Lightweight, Decentralized Metric-Semantic SLAM for Multi-Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17249v6)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a real-time decentralized metric-semantic SLAM algorithm that enables a heterogeneous robot team to collaboratively construct object-based metric-semantic maps. The proposed framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. The framework supports real-time, decentralized operation onboard the robots and has been integrated with three types of aerial and ground platforms. We validate its effectiveness through experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as benchmarks on public datasets and comparisons with existing methods. The framework is open-sourced and suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot real-time metric-semantic SLAM applications.

| **[Horticultural Temporal Fruit Monitoring via 3D Instance Segmentation and Re-Identification using Colored Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07799v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and consistent fruit monitoring over time is a key step toward automated agricultural production systems. However, this task is inherently difficult due to variations in fruit size, shape, occlusion, orientation, and the dynamic nature of orchards where fruits may appear or disappear between observations. In this article, we propose a novel method for fruit instance segmentation and re-identification on 3D terrestrial point clouds collected over time. Our approach directly operates on dense colored point clouds, capturing fine-grained 3D spatial detail. We segment individual fruits using a learning-based instance segmentation method applied directly to the point cloud. For each segmented fruit, we extract a compact and discriminative descriptor using a 3D sparse convolutional neural network. To track fruits across different times, we introduce an attention-based matching network that associates fruits with their counterparts from previous sessions. Matching is performed using a probabilistic assignment scheme, selecting the most likely associations across time. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets of strawberries and apples, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods in both instance segmentation and temporal re-identification, enabling robust and precise fruit monitoring across complex and dynamic orchard environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> | None |
| **[SCORE: Scene Context Matters in Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12857v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$ ($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary $\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that, our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis.

| **[Tree-SLAM: semantic object SLAM for efficient mapping of individual trees in orchards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12093v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate mapping of individual trees is an important component for precision agriculture in orchards, as it allows autonomous robots to perform tasks like targeted operations or individual tree monitoring. However, creating these maps is challenging because GPS signals are often unreliable under dense tree canopies. Furthermore, standard Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches struggle in orchards because the repetitive appearance of trees can confuse the system, leading to mapping errors. To address this, we introduce Tree-SLAM, a semantic SLAM approach tailored for creating maps of individual trees in orchards. Utilizing RGB-D images, our method detects tree trunks with an instance segmentation model, estimates their location and re-identifies them using a cascade-graph-based data association algorithm. These re-identified trunks serve as landmarks in a factor graph framework that integrates noisy GPS signals, odometry, and trunk observations. The system produces maps of individual trees with a geo-localization error as low as 18 cm, which is less than 20\% of the planting distance. The proposed method was validated on diverse datasets from apple and pear orchards across different seasons, demonstrating high mapping accuracy and robustness in scenarios with unreliable GPS signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted to Smart Agricultural Technology</p></details> | None |
| **[Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

| **[UAVDB: Point-Guided Masks for UAV Detection and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06490v6)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in surveillance, security, and airspace monitoring demands accurate and scalable detection solutions. However, progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-resolution datasets with precise and cost-effective annotations. We present UAVDB, a new benchmark dataset for UAV detection and segmentation, built upon a point-guided weak supervision pipeline. As its foundation, UAVDB leverages trajectory point annotations and RGB video frames from the multi-view drone tracking dataset, captured by fixed-camera setups. We introduce an efficient annotation method, Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC), which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes directly from these trajectory points, eliminating manual labeling while maintaining accurate spatial localization. We further derive instance segmentation masks from these bounding boxes using the second version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM2), enabling rich multi-task annotations with minimal supervision. UAVDB captures UAVs at diverse scales, from visible objects to near-single-pixel instances, under challenging environmental conditions. Particularly, PIC is lightweight and readily pluggable into other point-guided scenarios, making it easy to scale up dataset generation across domains. We quantitatively compare PIC against existing annotation techniques, demonstrating superior Intersection over Union (IoU) accuracy and annotation efficiency. Finally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO-series detectors on UAVDB, establishing strong baselines for future research.

| **[Spatial Frequency Modulation for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11893v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

To overcome these challenges, we developed TomatoMAP, a comprehensive dataset for Solanum lycopersicum using an Internet of Things (IoT) based imaging system with standardized data acquisition protocols. Our dataset contains 64,464 RGB images that capture 12 different plant poses from four camera elevation angles. Each image includes manually annotated bounding boxes for seven regions of interest (ROIs), including leaves, panicle, batch of flowers, batch of fruits, axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616 high-resolution image subset with pixel-wise semantic and instance segmentation annotations for fine-grained phenotyping. We validated our dataset using a cascading model deep learning framework combining MobileNetv3 for classification, YOLOv11 for object detection, and MaskRCNN for segmentation. Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to the experts. Cohen's Kappa and inter-rater agreement heatmap confirm the reliability of automated fine-grained phenotyping using our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[rt-RISeg: Real-Time Model-Free Robot Interactive Segmentation for Active Instance-Level Object Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10776v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, IROS 2025, Interactive Perception, Segmentation, Robotics, Computer Vision</p></details> | None |

This challenge is often addressed through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization (MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

SurfDist enables prediction of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts. For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging, SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D. These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be learned effectively alongside instance membership.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

High-throughput approaches are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine learning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> | None |

To efficiently extract and leverage this information, we propose the Context-Aware Instance Tracker (CAIT), which merges contextual data surrounding the instances with the core instance features to improve tracking accuracy. Additionally, we design the Prototypical Cross-frame Contrastive (PCC) loss, which ensures consistency in object-level features across frames, thereby significantly enhancing matching accuracy. CAVIS demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on all benchmark datasets in video instance segmentation (VIS) and video panoptic segmentation (VPS).

| **[Beyond Appearance: Geometric Cues for Robust Video Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05948v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets 56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios. In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction, instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval with high success rates.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RAM-W600: A Multi-Task Wrist Dataset and Benchmark for Rheumatoid Arthritis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05193v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis, which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii) Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional radiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level instance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548 images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within the RA-related domain.</p></details> |  | None |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains a challenge. Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for fundamental physics, but analysis of their sparse, complex point cloud data often relies on supervised methods trained on large simulations, introducing potential biases. We introduce the Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE), applying masked point modeling to unlabeled LArTPC images using domain-specific volumetric tokenization and energy prediction. We show this SSL approach learns physically meaningful trajectory representations directly from data. This yields remarkable data efficiency: fine-tuning on just 100 labeled events achieves track/shower semantic segmentation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised baseline trained on $>$100,000 events. Furthermore, internal attention maps exhibit emergent instance segmentation of particle trajectories. While challenges remain, particularly for fine-grained features, we make concrete SSL's potential for building a foundation model for LArTPC image analysis capable of serving as a common base for all data reconstruction tasks. To facilitate further progress, we release PILArNet-M, a large dataset of 1M LArTPC events.

| **[Static Segmentation by Tracking: A Label-Efficient Approach for Fine-Grained Specimen Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06749v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study image segmentation in the biological domain, particularly trait segmentation from specimen images (e.g., butterfly wing stripes, beetle elytra). This fine-grained task is crucial for understanding the biology of organisms, but it traditionally requires manually annotating segmentation masks for hundreds of images per species, making it highly labor-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a label-efficient approach, Static Segmentation by Tracking (SST), based on a key insight: while specimens of the same species exhibit natural variation, the traits of interest show up consistently. This motivates us to concatenate specimen images into a ``pseudo-video'' and reframe trait segmentation as a tracking problem. Specifically, SST generates masks for unlabeled images by propagating annotated or predicted masks from the ``pseudo-preceding'' images. Built upon recent video segmentation models, such as Segment Anything Model 2, SST achieves high-quality trait segmentation with only one labeled image per species, marking a breakthrough in specimen image analysis. To further enhance segmentation quality, we introduce a cycle-consistent loss for fine-tuning, again requiring only one labeled image. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader potential of SST, including one-shot instance segmentation in natural images and trait-based image retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[No time to train! Training-Free Reference-Based Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02798v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of image segmentation models has historically been constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors, as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1) memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).</p></details> | Preprint | None |
| **[Lightweight Structure-Aware Attention for Visual Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16289v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention operator has been widely used as a basic brick in visual understanding since it provides some flexibility through its adjustable kernels. However, this operator suffers from inherent limitations: (1) the attention kernel is not discriminative enough, resulting in high redundancy, and (2) the complexity in computation and memory is quadratic in the sequence length. In this paper, we propose a novel attention operator, called Lightweight Structure-aware Attention (LiSA), which has a better representation power with log-linear complexity. Our operator transforms the attention kernels to be more discriminative by learning structural patterns. These structural patterns are encoded by exploiting a set of relative position embeddings (RPEs) as multiplicative weights, thereby improving the representation power of the attention kernels. Additionally, the RPEs are approximated to obtain log-linear complexity. Our experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed operator outperforms self-attention and other existing operators, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K and other downstream tasks such as video action recognition on Kinetics-400, object detection \& instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE-20K.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Perception Activator: An intuitive and portable framework for brain cognitive exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02311v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress, reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation, confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully exploit or integrate.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D Reconstruction and Information Fusion between Dormant and Canopy Seasons in Commercial Orchards Using Deep Learning and Fast GICP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01912v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system. However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and 13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated, comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 tables, 11 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[NuSegDG: Integration of Heterogeneous Space and Gaussian Kernel for Domain-Generalized Nuclei Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11787v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-generalized nuclei segmentation refers to the generalizability of models to unseen domains based on knowledge learned from source domains and is challenged by various image conditions, cell types, and stain strategies. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great success in universal image segmentation by interactive prompt modes (e.g., point and box). Despite its strengths, the original SAM presents limited adaptation to medical images. Moreover, SAM requires providing manual bounding box prompts for each object to produce satisfactory segmentation masks, so it is laborious in nuclei segmentation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-generalizable framework for nuclei image segmentation, abbreviated to NuSegDG. Specifically, we first devise a Heterogeneous Space Adapter (HS-Adapter) to learn multi-dimensional feature representations of different nuclei domains by injecting a small number of trainable parameters into the image encoder of SAM. To alleviate the labor-intensive requirement of manual prompts, we introduce a Gaussian-Kernel Prompt Encoder (GKP-Encoder) to generate density maps driven by a single point, which guides segmentation predictions by mixing position prompts and semantic prompts. Furthermore, we present a Two-Stage Mask Decoder (TSM-Decoder) to effectively convert semantic masks to instance maps without the manual demand for morphological shape refinement. Based on our experimental evaluations, the proposed NuSegDG demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in nuclei instance segmentation, exhibiting superior domain generalization capabilities.

| **[NOCTIS: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01463v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision. Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D, calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, NeurIPS 2025 preprint</p></details> | None |
| **[Semantic Equitable Clustering: A Simple and Effective Strategy for Clustering Vision Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13337v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained prominence for its superior relational modeling prowess. However, its global attention mechanism's quadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy spatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in tokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups, thus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling inter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and balanced clustering method, named Semantic Equitable Clustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic relevance in an efficient, straightforward manner. In contrast to traditional clustering methods requiring multiple iterations, our method achieves token clustering in a single pass. Additionally, SEC regulates the number of tokens per cluster, ensuring a balanced distribution for effective parallel processing on current computational platforms without necessitating further optimization. Capitalizing on SEC, we propose a versatile vision backbone, SECViT. Comprehensive experiments in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of SECViT. Moreover, SEC can be conveniently and swiftly applied to multimodal large language models (MLLM), such as LLaVA, to serve as a vision language connector, effectively accelerating the model's efficiency while maintaining unchanged or better performance.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | None |
| **[Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/qhfan/MALA) |

Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF), aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%, 17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the second-best results on structurally complex datasets. More importantly, PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance segmentation tasks. Across all plant datasets, it achieved average improvements of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively. This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of large-scale models in plant science.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies.

In this work, we treat the model as a multi-task framework, simultaneously performing one-to-one and one-to-many predictions. We investigate the roles of each component in the transformer decoder across these two training targets, including self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward network. Our empirical results demonstrate that any independent component in the decoder can effectively learn both targets simultaneously, even when other components are shared. This finding leads us to propose a multi-route training mechanism, featuring a primary route for one-to-one prediction and two auxiliary training routes for one-to-many prediction. We propose a novel instructive self-attention mechanism, integrated into the first auxiliary route, which dynamically and flexibly guides object queries for one-to-many prediction. For the second auxiliary route, we introduce a route-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to facilitate knowledge sharing while mitigating potential conflicts between routes. Additionally, we apply an MoE to low-scale features in the encoder, optimizing the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The auxiliary routes are discarded during inference. We conduct extensive experiments across various object detection baselines, achieving consistent improvements as demonstrated in Fig. 1. Our method is highly flexible and can be readily adapted to other tasks.

However, when applied to new conditions, these applications frequently face the difficulty of overfitting, resulting in lower segmentation performance. In the context of potato farming, where diseases have a large influence on yields, it is critical for the agricultural economy to quickly and properly identify these diseases. Traditional data augmentation approaches, such as rotation, flip, and translation, have limitations and frequently fail to provide strong generalization results. To address these issues, our research employs a novel approach termed as PotatoGANs. In this novel data augmentation approach, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to generate synthetic potato disease images from healthy potato images. This approach not only expands the dataset but also adds variety, which helps to enhance model generalization. Using the Inception score as a measure, our experiments show the better quality and realisticness of the images created by PotatoGANs, emphasizing their capacity to resemble real disease images closely. The CycleGAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in terms of image quality, as evidenced by its higher IS scores CycleGAN achieves higher Inception scores (IS) of 1.2001 and 1.0900 for black scurf and common scab, respectively. This synthetic data can significantly improve the training of large neural networks. It also reduces data collection costs while enhancing data diversity and generalization capabilities. Our work improves interpretability by combining three gradient-based Explainable AI algorithms (GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM) with three distinct CNN architectures (DenseNet169, Resnet152 V2, InceptionResNet V2) for potato disease classification.</p></details> |  | None |

Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features. In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention mechanism.

| **[Co-Seg++: Mutual Prompt-Guided Collaborative Learning for Versatile Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17159v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances.

| **[LunarLoc: Segment-Based Global Localization on the Moon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16940v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS, is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain, which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings. LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data) |
| **[From Semantic To Instance: A Semi-Self-Supervised Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16563v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation. The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.</p></details> |  | None |

This makes 360 scene understanding tasks, eg, segmentation and tracking, crucial for appications, such as autonomous driving, robotics. With the recent emergence of foundation models, the community is, however, impeded by the lack of large-scale, labelled real-world datasets. This is caused by the inherent spherical properties, eg, severe distortion in polar regions, and content discontinuities, rendering the annotation costly yet complex. This paper introduces Leader360V, the first large-scale, labeled real-world 360 video datasets for instance segmentation and tracking. Our datasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to natural and dynamic outdoor scenes. To automate annotation, we design an automatic labeling pipeline, which subtly coordinates pre-trained 2D segmentors and large language models to facilitate the labeling. The pipeline operates in three novel stages. Specifically, in the Initial Annotation Phase, we introduce a Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement module, which combines object mask proposals from multiple 2D segmentors with LLM-verified semantic labels. These are then converted into mask prompts to guide SAM2 in generating distortion-aware masks for subsequent frames. In the Auto-Refine Annotation Phase, missing or incomplete regions are corrected either by applying the SDR again or resolving the discontinuities near the horizontal borders. The Manual Revision Phase finally incorporates LLMs and human annotators to further refine and validate the annotations. Extensive user studies and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our labeling pipeline. Meanwhile, experiments confirm that Leader360V significantly enhances model performance for 360 video segmentation and tracking, paving the way for more scalable 360 scene understanding.</p></details> | 23 pages, 16 figures | None |

In this survey, we present a holistic review of recent advances in VSP, covering a wide array of vision tasks, including Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS), Video Instance Segmentation (VIS), Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), as well as Video Tracking and Segmentation (VTS), and Open-Vocabulary Video Segmentation (OVVS). We systematically analyze the evolution from traditional hand-crafted features to modern deep learning paradigms -- spanning from fully convolutional networks to the latest transformer-based architectures -- and assess their effectiveness in capturing both local and global temporal contexts. Furthermore, our review critically discusses the technical challenges, ranging from maintaining temporal consistency to handling complex scene dynamics, and offers a comprehensive comparative study of datasets and evaluation metrics that have shaped current benchmarking standards. By distilling the key contributions and shortcomings of state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey highlights emerging trends and prospective research directions that promise to further elevate the robustness and adaptability of VSP in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

SAR ship images present challenges including scale variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness and generalization on SAR ship datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures | None |

This is mainly caused by the significant appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when applied to diverse real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2024</p></details> | None |

| **[Accurate and efficient zero-shot 6D pose estimation with frozen foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09784v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable 8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.</p></details> | Technical report | None |
| **[The Four Color Theorem for Cell Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09724v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell instance segmentation is critical to analyzing biomedical images, yet accurately distinguishing tightly touching cells remains a persistent challenge. Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method. Extensive experiments on various modes demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice (quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context. Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification and measurement.</p></details> | 15 pages, 41 figures | None |

To address this bottleneck, we introduce SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives, our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments, making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce $\textbf{LIFT-GS}$, a practical distillation technique that overcomes this limitation by using differentiable rendering to bridge 3D and 2D supervision. LIFT-GS predicts 3D Gaussian representations from point clouds and uses them to render predicted language-conditioned 3D masks into 2D views, enabling supervision from 2D foundation models (SAM, CLIP, LLaMA) without requiring any 3D annotations. This render-supervised formulation enables end-to-end training of complete encoder-decoder architectures and is inherently model-agnostic. LIFT-GS achieves state-of-the-art results with $25.7\%$ mAP on open-vocabulary instance segmentation (vs. $20.2\%$ prior SOTA) and consistent $10-30\%$ improvements on referential grounding tasks. Remarkably, pretraining effectively multiplies fine-tuning datasets by 2X, demonstrating strong scaling properties that suggest 3D VLG currently operates in a severely data-scarce regime.

In this paper, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling, termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.

Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

Current monitoring methods involve ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2) temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM) information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations. We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree crown instance segmentation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Such systems have matured significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks.

A common solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However, current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT.

To address this challenge, we establish two criteria that high-quality superpoints for Transformers should satisfy and introduce a corresponding two-stage superpoint generation process. The superpoints generated by our method not only have accurate boundaries, but also exhibit consistent geometric sizes and shapes, both of which greatly benefit the feature learning of superpoint Transformers. To compensate for the limitations of deep learning features when the training set size is limited, we incorporate multidimensional handcrafted features into the model. Additionally, we design a decoder that combines a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with a Transformer module to improve instance prediction and mask extraction. Finally, our network's predictions are refined using traditional algorithm-based postprocessing. For evaluation, we annotated a real-world dataset and corrected annotation errors in the existing RoofN3D dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on our dataset, as well as both the original and reannotated RoofN3D datasets. Moreover, our model is not sensitive to plane boundary annotations during training, significantly reducing the annotation burden. Through comprehensive experiments, we also identified key factors influencing roof plane segmentation performance: in addition to roof types, variations in point cloud density, density uniformity, and 3D point precision have a considerable impact. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating data augmentation strategies that account for point cloud quality to enhance model robustness under diverse and challenging conditions.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures | None |

Our dataset generation tool can render complex 3D scenes containing object meshes, materials, textures, lighting, and backgrounds.

Our tool eliminates the need for manual labeling in the dataset generation process while ensuring the quality and accuracy of the dataset. In this work, we discuss our design goals, framework architecture, and the performance of our tool. We demonstrate the use of a sample dataset generated using SynTable for training a state-of-the-art model, UOAIS-Net.

However, the quadratic growth in computational demands as the number of tokens increases limits its practical efficiency. Although recent methods have combined the strengths of convolutions and self-attention to achieve better trade-offs, the expensive pairwise token affinity and complex matrix operations inherent in self-attention remain a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose S2AFormer, an efficient Vision Transformer architecture featuring novel Strip Self-Attention (SSA). We design simple yet effective Hybrid Perception Blocks (HPBs) to effectively integrate the local perception capabilities of CNNs with the global context modeling of Transformer's attention mechanisms. A key innovation of SSA lies in its reducing the spatial dimensions of $K$ and $V$ while compressing the channel dimensions of $Q$ and $K$. This design significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving accuracy, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness. We evaluate the robustness and efficiency of S2AFormer through extensive experiments on multiple vision benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for image classification, ADE20k for semantic segmentation, and COCO for object detection and instance segmentation. Results demonstrate that S2AFormer achieves significant accuracy gains with superior efficiency in both GPU and non-GPU environments, making it a strong candidate for efficient vision Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework that compresses pretrained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM teacher(s) via self-training with contrastive pixel calibration, (2) distillation into a compact student via a unified multi-objective loss that couples standard supervision and pseudo-labels with our instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive term, and (3) fine-tuning on labeled data to remove residual pseudo-label bias. Central to CAST is an \emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask and class scores to mine informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11X smaller student surpasses its adapted VFM teacher(s) by +3.4 AP (33.9 vs. 30.5) and +1.5 AP (16.7 vs. 15.2) and outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing works probe into the problem by finetuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for segmentation-based output, while still falling short in difficult cases on videos given temporally-sensitive queries, primarily due to the failure to integrate temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we propose ThinkVideo, a novel framework which leverages the zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these challenges. Specifically, ThinkVideo utilizes the CoT prompts to extract object selectivities associated with particular keyframes, then bridging the reasoning image segmentation model and SAM2 video processor to output mask sequences. The ThinkVideo framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs, which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. We further extend the framework for online video streams, where the CoT is used to update the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with explicit and implicit queries. The results show that ThinkVideo significantly outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~skao/thinkvideo.html</p></details> | None |

Plastics fare worse, with a recycling rate of only 8%; an additional 16% is incinerated, while the remaining 76% ends up in landfills. The low plastic recycling rate stems from contamination, poor economic incentives, and technical difficulties, making efficient recycling a challenge. To improve recovery, automated sorting plays a critical role. Companies like AMP Robotics and Greyparrot utilize optical systems for sorting, while Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) employ Near-Infrared (NIR) sensors to detect plastic types. Modern optical sorting uses advances in computer vision such as object recognition and instance segmentation, powered by machine learning. Two-stage detectors like Mask R-CNN use region proposals and classification with deep backbones like ResNet. Single-stage detectors like YOLO handle detection in one pass, trading some accuracy for speed. While such methods excel under ideal conditions with a large volume of labeled training data, challenges arise in realistic scenarios, emphasizing the need to further examine the efficacy of optic detection for automated sorting. In this study, we compiled novel datasets totaling 20,000+ images from varied sources. Using both public and custom machine learning pipelines, we assessed the capabilities and limitations of optical recognition for sorting. Grad-CAM, saliency maps, and confusion matrices were employed to interpret model behavior. We perform this analysis on our custom trained models from the compiled datasets. To conclude, our findings are that optic recognition methods have limited success in accurate sorting of real-world plastics at MRFs, primarily because they rely on physical properties such as color and shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2024 REMADE Circular Economy Tech Summit and Conference, https://remadeinstitute.org/2024-conference/</p></details> | None |
| **[Sketchy Bounding-box Supervision for 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16399v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bounding box supervision has gained considerable attention in weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation. While this approach alleviates the need for extensive point-level annotations, obtaining accurate bounding boxes in practical applications remains challenging. To this end, we explore the inaccurate bounding box, named sketchy bounding box, which is imitated through perturbing ground truth bounding box by adding scaling, translation, and rotation. In this paper, we propose Sketchy-3DIS, a novel weakly 3D instance segmentation framework, which jointly learns pseudo labeler and segmentator to improve the performance under the sketchy bounding-box supervisions. Specifically, we first propose an adaptive box-to-point pseudo labeler that adaptively learns to assign points located in the overlapped parts between two sketchy bounding boxes to the correct instance, resulting in compact and pure pseudo instance labels. Then, we present a coarse-to-fine instance segmentator that first predicts coarse instances from the entire point cloud and then learns fine instances based on the region of coarse instances. Finally, by using the pseudo instance labels to supervise the instance segmentator, we can gradually generate high-quality instances through joint training. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ScanNetV2 and S3DIS benchmarks, and even outperforms several fully supervised methods using sketchy bounding boxes.

Unfortunately, when LiDAR is applied to Place Recognition (PR) in mobile robotics, most previous works on LiDAR-based PR rely only on geometric measurements, neglecting the additional reflectivity information that LiDAR provides. In this paper, we propose a novel descriptor for 3D PR, named RE-TRIP (REflectivity-instance augmented TRIangle descriPtor). This new descriptor leverages both geometric measurements and reflectivity to enhance robustness in challenging scenarios such as geometric degeneracy, high geometric similarity, and the presence of dynamic objects. To implement RE-TRIP in real-world applications, we further propose (1) a keypoint extraction method, (2) a key instance segmentation method, (3) a RE-TRIP matching method, and (4) a reflectivity-combined loop verification method. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of RE-TRIP. Applied to public datasets (i.e., HELIPR, FusionPortable) containing diverse scenarios such as long corridors, bridges, large-scale urban areas, and highly dynamic environments -- our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Scan Context, Intensity Scan Context, and STD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLIMB-3D: Continual Learning for Imbalanced 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17429v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, existing methods typically assume that all object classes are known in advance and are uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches have addressed class emergence, they often overlook class imbalance, resulting in suboptimal performance -- particularly on rare categories. To tackle this challenge, we propose CLIMB-3D, a unified framework for \textbf{CL}ass-incremental \textbf{Imb}alance-aware \textbf{3D}IS. Building upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust performance under constrained memory conditions. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen prior model. Despite its promise, PLG tends to bias towards frequent classes. Therefore, we propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme, that estimates object frequencies from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias -- without requiring access to past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, and additionally on semantic segmentation on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by up to 16.76\% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30\% mIoU for semantic segmentation, demonstrating strong generalization across both frequent and rare classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D) |

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the right-skewed asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix; v2: slight improvement in presentation.

However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets.

How can we repurpose these generative representations for general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE (encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without internet-scale pretraining.

The feature representations of shapes learned by these two networks enabled training classifiers for Semantic Segmentation, and more recently for Instance Segmentation via the Similarity Group Proposal Network (SGPN) [WYHN17]. One area of improvement which has been highlighted by SGPN's authors, pertains to use of memory intensive similarity matrices which occupy memory quadratic in the number of points. In this report, we attempt to tackle this issue through use of two sampling based methods, which compute Instance Segmentation on a sub-sampled Point Set, and then extrapolate labels to the complete set using the nearest neigbhour approach. While both approaches perform equally well on large sub-samples, the random-based strategy gives the most improvements in terms of speed and memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 11 figures, paper dated 2019</p></details> | None |

The existing methods severely suffer from bias classification because of the missing label issue which naturally exists in an instance-level few-shot scenario and is first formally proposed by us. Our analysis suggests that the standard classification head of most FSOD or FSIS models needs to be decoupled to mitigate the bias classification. Therefore, we propose an embarrassingly simple but effective method that decouples the standard classifier into two heads. Then, these two individual heads are capable of independently addressing clear positive samples and noisy negative samples which are caused by the missing label. In this way, the model can effectively learn novel classes while mitigating the effects of noisy negative samples. Without bells and whistles, our model without any additional computation cost and parameters consistently outperforms its baseline and state-of-the-art by a large margin on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO benchmarks for FSOD and FSIS tasks.

However, industrial applications face two key challenges: (1) legal and ethical restrictions, such as ImageNet's prohibition of commercial use, and (2) limited transferability due to the domain gap between web images and industrial imagery. Even recent vision foundation models, including the segment anything model (SAM), show notable performance degradation in industrial settings. These challenges raise critical questions: Can we build a vision foundation model for industrial applications without relying on real images or manual annotations? And can such models outperform even fine-tuned SAM on industrial datasets? To address these questions, we propose the Instance Core Segmentation Dataset (InsCore), a synthetic pre-training dataset based on formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL). InsCore generates fully annotated instance segmentation images that reflect key characteristics of industrial data, including complex occlusions, dense hierarchical masks, and diverse non-rigid shapes, distinct from typical web imagery. Unlike previous methods, InsCore requires neither real images nor human annotations. Experiments on five industrial datasets show that models pre-trained with InsCore outperform those trained on COCO and ImageNet-21k, as well as fine-tuned SAM, achieving an average improvement of 6.2 points in instance segmentation performance. This result is achieved using only 100k synthetic images, more than 100 times fewer than the 11 million images in SAM's SA-1B dataset, demonstrating the data efficiency of our approach.

We hypothesize that this design choice may limit models in learning comprehensive and compositional representations from visual data. This paper explores the notion of providing semantically-meaningful visual tokens to transformer encoders within a vision-language pre-training framework. Leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and scene-graph models, we extract representations of instance segmentation masks (referred to as tangible tokens) and relationships and actions (referred to as intangible tokens). Subsequently, we pre-train a vision-side transformer by incorporating these newly extracted tokens and aligning the resultant embeddings with caption embeddings from a text-side encoder. To capture the structural and semantic relationships among visual tokens, we introduce additive attention weights, which are used to compute self-attention scores. Our experiments on COCO demonstrate notable improvements over ViTs in learned representation quality across text-to-image (+47%) and image-to-text retrieval (+44%) tasks. Furthermore, we showcase the advantages on compositionality benchmarks such as ARO (+18%) and Winoground (+10%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR Workshops 2025</p></details> | None |

At the core of their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of global dependencies among input tokens. However, we reveal that the attention block in transformers suffers from inherent ill-conditioning, which hampers gradient-based optimization and leads to inefficient training. To address this, we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing, highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

Detection--based metrics such as F1 and mAP determine correctness at the object level using fixed overlap cutoffs, while overlap--based metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice operate at the pixel level, often overlooking instance--level structure. Panoptic Quality (PQ) attempts to unify detection and segmentation assessment, but it remains dependent on hard-threshold matching--treating predictions below the threshold as entirely incorrect. This binary framing obscures important distinctions between qualitatively different errors and fails to reward gradual model improvements. We propose SoftPQ, a flexible and interpretable instance segmentation metric that redefines evaluation as a graded continuum rather than a binary classification. SoftPQ introduces tunable upper and lower IoU thresholds to define a partial matching region and applies a sublinear penalty function to ambiguous or fragmented predictions. These extensions allow SoftPQ to exhibit smoother score behavior, greater robustness to structural segmentation errors, and more informative feedback for model development and evaluation. Through controlled perturbation experiments, we show that SoftPQ captures meaningful differences in segmentation quality that existing metrics overlook, making it a practical and principled alternative for both benchmarking and iterative model refinement.</p></details> |  | None |

While traditional marker-based methods offer accuracy, they face challenges with occlusions, reflections, and tool-specific designs. Similarly, supervised learning methods require extensive training on annotated datasets, limiting their adaptability to new tools. Despite their success in other domains, zero-shot pose estimation models remain unexplored in RMIS for pose estimation of surgical instruments, creating a gap in generalising to unseen surgical tools. This paper presents a novel 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose estimation pipeline for surgical instruments, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-shot RGB-D models like the FoundationPose and SAM-6D. We advanced these models by incorporating vision-based depth estimation using the RAFT-Stereo method, for robust depth estimation in reflective and textureless environments. Additionally, we enhanced SAM-6D by replacing its instance segmentation module, Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN, significantly boosting segmentation accuracy in occluded and complex conditions. Extensive validation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in zero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS.

| **[Pseudo-Label Quality Decoupling and Correction for Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11075v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation (SSIS) involves classifying and grouping image pixels into distinct object instances using limited labeled data. This learning paradigm usually faces a significant challenge of unstable performance caused by noisy pseudo-labels of instance categories and pixel masks. We find that the prevalent practice of filtering instance pseudo-labels assessing both class and mask quality with a single score threshold, frequently leads to compromises in the trade-off between the qualities of class and mask labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel Pseudo-Label Quality Decoupling and Correction (PL-DC) framework for SSIS to tackle the above challenges. Firstly, at the instance level, a decoupled dual-threshold filtering mechanism is designed to decouple class and mask quality estimations for instance-level pseudo-labels, thereby independently controlling pixel classifying and grouping qualities. Secondly, at the category level, we introduce a dynamic instance category correction module to dynamically correct the pseudo-labels of instance categories, effectively alleviating category confusion. Lastly, we introduce a pixel-level mask uncertainty-aware mechanism at the pixel level to re-weight the mask loss for different pixels, thereby reducing the impact of noise introduced by pixel-level mask pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the COCO and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that the proposed PL-DC achieves significant performance improvements, setting new state-of-the-art results for SSIS.

This work explores semantic anomaly detection by leveraging the semantic priors of state-of-the-art vision foundation models, operating directly on the image. We propose a framework that compares local vision embeddings from runtime images to a database of nominal scenarios in which the autonomous system is deemed safe and performant. In this work, we consider two variants of the proposed framework: one using raw grid-based embeddings, and another leveraging instance segmentation for object-centric representations. To further improve robustness, we introduce a simple filtering mechanism to suppress false positives. Our evaluations on CARLA-simulated anomalies show that the instance-based method with filtering achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, while providing precise anomaly localization. These results highlight the potential utility of vision embeddings from foundation models for real-time anomaly detection in autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the Workshop "Safely Leveraging Vision-Language Foundation Models in Robotics: Challenges and Opportunities" at ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

Our system enables users to visualize robot perception outputs such as object detection and segmentation results using a MR device. Therefore, users can inspect failures of perception models using the system on real robots. Moreover, iTeach facilitates real-time, informed data collection and annotation, where users can use hand gesture, eye gaze and voice commands to annotate images collected from robots. The annotated images can be used to fine-tune perception models to improve their accuracy and adaptability. The system continually improves perception models by collecting annotations of failed examples from users. When applied to object detection and unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) tasks, iTeach demonstrates encouraging results in improving pre-trained vision models for these two tasks.

| **[Generalized Class Discovery in Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08149v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the task of generalized class discovery (GCD) in instance segmentation. The goal is to discover novel classes and obtain a model capable of segmenting instances of both known and novel categories, given labeled and unlabeled data. Since the real world contains numerous objects with long-tailed distributions, the instance distribution for each class is inherently imbalanced. To address the imbalanced distributions, we propose an instance-wise temperature assignment (ITA) method for contrastive learning and class-wise reliability criteria for pseudo-labels. The ITA method relaxes instance discrimination for samples belonging to head classes to enhance GCD. The reliability criteria are to avoid excluding most pseudo-labels for tail classes when training an instance segmentation network using pseudo-labels from GCD. Additionally, we propose dynamically adjusting the criteria to leverage diverse samples in the early stages while relying only on reliable pseudo-labels in the later stages. We also introduce an efficient soft attention module to encode object-specific representations for GCD. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method by conducting experiments on two settings: COCO$_{half}$ + LVIS and LVIS + Visual Genome. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |

Furthermore, a virtual cotton farm was designed and developed as a Robot Operating System (ROS 1) package to deploy the robotic cotton picker in the Gazebo environment for simulating autonomous field navigation. The navigation was assisted by the map coordinates and an RGB-depth camera, while the ROS navigation algorithm utilized a trained YOLOv8n-seg model for instance segmentation. The model achieved a desired mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.2%, a recall of 88.9%, and a precision of 93.0% for scene segmentation. The developed ROS navigation packages enabled our robotic cotton-picking system to autonomously navigate through the cotton field using map-based and GPS-based approaches, visually aided by a deep learning-based perception system. The GPS-based navigation approach achieved a 100% completion rate (CR) with a threshold of 5 x 10^-6 degrees, while the map-based navigation approach attained a 96.7% CR with a threshold of 0.25 m.

However, the computational efficiency of the model and the treatment of overlapping targets are the major challenges in the studies of this problem. To this end, a neural network model RepSNet was designed based on a nucleus boundary regression and a structural re-parameterization scheme for segmenting and classifying the nuclei in H\&E-stained histopathological images. First, RepSNet estimates the boundary position information (BPI) of the parent nucleus for each pixel. The BPI estimation incorporates the local information of the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the nucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels using a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation results are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected component analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of synergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore, different from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus boundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its boundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using an integration mechanism. In addition, RepSNet employs a re-parametrizable encoder-decoder structure. This model can not only aggregate features from some receptive fields with various scales which helps segmentation accuracy improvement, but also reduce the parameter amount and computational burdens in the model inference phase through the structural re-parameterization technique. Extensive experiments demonstrated the superiorities of RepSNet compared to several typical benchmark models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a practical approach for reducing computational overhead, existing PTQ methods rely on fixed bit-width quantization, leading to suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose Mix-QSAM, a mixed-precision PTQ framework for SAM. First, we introduce a layer-wise importance score, derived using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, to quantify each layer's contribution to the model's output. Second, we introduce cross-layer synergy, a novel metric based on causal mutual information, to capture dependencies between adjacent layers. This ensures that highly interdependent layers maintain similar bit-widths, preventing abrupt precision mismatches that degrade feature propagation and numerical stability. Using these metrics, we formulate an Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) problem to determine optimal bit-width allocation under model size and bit-operation constraints, assigning higher precision to critical layers while minimizing bit-width in less influential layers. Experimental results demonstrate that Mix-QSAM consistently outperforms existing PTQ methods on instance segmentation and object detection tasks, achieving up to 20% higher average precision under 6-bit and 4-bit mixed-precision settings, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 Figures | None |

We propose two key modules: Efficient-KAN (Eff-KAN), which replaces MLP layers with spline functions and Wavelet-KAN (Wav-KAN), leveraging orthogonal wavelet transforms for multi-resolution feature extraction. These modules are systematically integrated in ViT encoder layers and classification heads to enhance spatial-frequency modeling while mitigating computational bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K (Image Recognition), COCO (Object Detection and Instance Segmentation), and ADE20K (Semantic Segmentation) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with Hyb-KAN ViT.

| **[Instance Segmentation of Scene Sketches Using Natural Image Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09608v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketch segmentation involves grouping pixels within a sketch that belong to the same object or instance. It serves as a valuable tool for sketch editing tasks, such as moving, scaling, or removing specific components. While image segmentation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recent years, sketches present unique challenges for these models due to their sparse nature and wide variation in styles. We introduce InkLayer, a method for instance segmentation of raster scene sketches. Our approach adapts state-of-the-art image segmentation and object detection models to the sketch domain by employing class-agnostic fine-tuning and refining segmentation masks using depth cues. Furthermore, our method organizes sketches into sorted layers, where occluded instances are inpainted, enabling advanced sketch editing applications. As existing datasets in this domain lack variation in sketch styles, we construct a synthetic scene sketch segmentation dataset, InkScenes, featuring sketches with diverse brush strokes and varying levels of detail.

We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf grasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through self-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance segmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf representations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and a neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution of each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework uses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate training data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0% success rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse conditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and neural (60.2%) methods.

However, SAM is trained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for scene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low light and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes the powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash the potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T data pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original SAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong generalization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we introduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address cross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while maintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the minimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating the combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we enhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM and incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates multi-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted across three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900, and FMB. Both quantitative and qualitative results consistently demonstrate that the proposed SARTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a variety of conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.04220 by other authors</p></details> | None |
| **[A Novel WaveInst-based Network for Tree Trunk Structure Extraction and Pattern Analysis in Forest Inventory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01656v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pattern analysis of tree structure holds significant scientific value for genetic breeding and forestry management. The current trunk and branch extraction technologies are mainly LiDAR-based or UAV-based. The former approaches obtain high-precision 3D data, but its equipment cost is high and the three-dimensional (3D) data processing is complex. The latter approaches efficiently capture canopy information, but they miss the 3-D structure of trees. In order to deal with the branch information extraction from the complex background interference and occlusion, this work proposes a novel WaveInst instance segmentation framework, involving a discrete wavelet transform, to enhance multi-scale edge information for accurately improving tree structure extraction. Experimental results of the proposed model show superior performance on SynthTree43k, CaneTree100, Urban Street and our PoplarDataset. Moreover, we present a new Phenotypic dataset PoplarDataset, which is dedicated to extract tree structure and pattern analysis from artificial forest. The proposed method achieves a mean average precision of 49.6 and 24.3 for the structure extraction of mature and juvenile trees, respectively, surpassing the existing state-of-the-art method by 9.9. Furthermore, by in tegrating the segmentation model within the regression model, we accurately achieve significant tree grown parameters, such as the location of trees, the diameter-at-breast-height of individual trees, and the plant height, from 2D images directly. This study provides a scientific and plenty of data for tree structure analysis in related to the phenotype research, offering a platform for the significant applications in precision forestry, ecological monitoring, and intelligent breeding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Global Collinearity-aware Polygonizer for Polygonal Building Mapping in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01385v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of mapping polygonal buildings from remote sensing images and introduces a novel algorithm, the Global Collinearity-aware Polygonizer (GCP). GCP, built upon an instance segmentation framework, processes binary masks produced by any instance segmentation model. The algorithm begins by collecting polylines sampled along the contours of the binary masks. These polylines undergo a refinement process using a transformer-based regression module to ensure they accurately fit the contours of the targeted building instances. Subsequently, a collinearity-aware polygon simplification module simplifies these refined polylines and generate the final polygon representation. This module employs dynamic programming technique to optimize an objective function that balances the simplicity and fidelity of the polygons, achieving globally optimal solutions. Furthermore, the optimized collinearity-aware objective is seamlessly integrated into network training, enhancing the cohesiveness of the entire pipeline. The effectiveness of GCP has been validated on two public benchmarks for polygonal building mapping. Further experiments reveal that applying the collinearity-aware polygon simplification module to arbitrary polylines, without prior knowledge, enhances accuracy over traditional methods such as the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. This finding underscores the broad applicability of GCP. The code for the proposed method will be made available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MoSAM: Motion-Guided Segment Anything Model with Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00739v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in interactive object segmentation for both images and videos. However, as a foundational model on interactive segmentation, SAM2 performs segmentation directly based on mask memory from the past six frames, leading to two significant challenges. Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may disappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object motion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities. Secondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it susceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion, due to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these problems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate object motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory. Firstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object motion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a set of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards the direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we devise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically identifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and frame-level. By eliminating potentially inaccurate mask predictions from memory, we can leverage more reliable memory features to exploit similar regions for improving segmentation results. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks of video object segmentation and video instance segmentation demonstrate that our MoSAM achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other competitors.</p></details> |  | None |

Given a single test image, 3DMMs can be used to solve various tasks, such as predicting the 3D shape, pose, semantic correspondence, and instance segmentation of an object. Unfortunately, 3DMMs are only available for very few object categories that are of particular interest, like faces or human bodies, as they require a demanding 3D data acquisition and category-specific training process. In contrast, we introduce a new method, Common3D, that learns 3DMMs of common objects in a fully self-supervised manner from a collection of object-centric videos. For this purpose, our model represents objects as a learned 3D template mesh and a deformation field that is parameterized as an image-conditioned neural network. Different from prior works, Common3D represents the object appearance with neural features instead of RGB colors, which enables the learning of more generalizable representations through an abstraction from pixel intensities. Importantly, we train the appearance features using a contrastive objective by exploiting the correspondences defined through the deformable template mesh. This leads to higher quality correspondence features compared to related works and a significantly improved model performance at estimating 3D object pose and semantic correspondence. Common3D is the first completely self-supervised method that can solve various vision tasks in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> |  | None |

Furthermore, we also propose a data generator, filling the gap in the dataset for fine-grained deformation table cell spatial coordinate localization, and derive a large-scale dataset named Deformation Wired Table (DWTAL).

Although deep learning models such as Mask R-CNN and BlendMask have achieved remarkable progress, their application in high-risk medical scenarios remains constrained by confidence calibration issues, which may lead to misdiagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose a robust quality control framework based on conformal prediction theory. This framework innovatively constructs a risk-aware dynamic threshold mechanism that adaptively adjusts segmentation decision boundaries according to clinical requirements.Specifically, we design a \textbf{calibration-aware loss function} that dynamically tunes the segmentation threshold based on a user-defined risk level $\alpha$. Utilizing exchangeable calibration data, this method ensures that the expected FNR or FDR on test data remains below $\alpha$ with high probability. The framework maintains compatibility with mainstream segmentation models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, BlendMask+ResNet-50-FPN) and datasets (PASCAL VOC format) without requiring architectural modifications. Empirical results demonstrate that we rigorously bound the FDR metric marginally over the test set via our developed calibration framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Image Processing and Computer Applications (ICIPCA 2025)</p></details> | None |

The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training.

| **[Scene-Aware Location Modeling for Data Augmentation in Automotive Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17076v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative image models are increasingly being used for training data augmentation in vision tasks. In the context of automotive object detection, methods usually focus on producing augmented frames that look as realistic as possible, for example by replacing real objects with generated ones. Others try to maximize the diversity of augmented frames, for example by pasting lots of generated objects onto existing backgrounds. Both perspectives pay little attention to the locations of objects in the scene. Frame layouts are either reused with little or no modification, or they are random and disregard realism entirely. In this work, we argue that optimal data augmentation should also include realistic augmentation of layouts. We introduce a scene-aware probabilistic location model that predicts where new objects can realistically be placed in an existing scene. By then inpainting objects in these locations with a generative model, we obtain much stronger augmentation performance than existing approaches. We set a new state of the art for generative data augmentation on two automotive object detection tasks, achieving up to $2.8\times$ higher gains than the best competing approach ($+1.4$ vs. $+0.5$ mAP boost). We also demonstrate significant improvements for instance segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method integrates instance segmentation with generative inpainting to remove identifiable entities while preserving scene integrity. Extensive evaluations on 2D COCO-based object detection show that ROAR achieves 87.5% of the baseline detection average precision (AP), whereas image dropping achieves only 74.2% of the baseline AP, highlighting the advantage of scrubbing in preserving dataset utility. The degradation is even more severe for small objects due to occlusion and loss of fine-grained details. Furthermore, in NeRF-based 3D reconstruction, our method incurs a PSNR loss of at most 1.66 dB while maintaining SSIM and improving LPIPS, demonstrating superior perceptual quality. Our findings establish object removal as an effective privacy framework, achieving strong privacy guarantees with minimal performance trade-offs. The results highlight key challenges in generative inpainting, occlusion-robust segmentation, and task-specific scrubbing, setting the foundation for future advancements in privacy-preserving vision systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[ClusterViG: Efficient Globally Aware Vision GNNs via Image Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10640v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have dominated the field of Computer Vision (CV). Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | IEEE MCNA 2025 | None |

Our method simulates realistic 3D perspectives, effectively augmenting existing hard visual prompts by enforcing geometric consistency across viewpoints. This training-free strategy seamlessly integrates with prior hard visual prompts, enriching object-descriptive features and enabling VLMs to achieve more robust and accurate 3D instance segmentation in diverse 3D scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Occlusion-Ordered Semantic Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14054v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard semantic instance segmentation provides useful, but inherently 2D information from a single image. To enable 3D analysis, one usually integrates absolute monocular depth estimation with instance segmentation. However, monocular depth is a difficult task. Instead, we leverage a simpler single-image task, occlusion-based relative depth ordering, providing coarser but useful 3D information. We show that relative depth ordering works more reliably from occlusions than from absolute depth. We propose to solve the joint task of relative depth ordering and segmentation of instances based on occlusions. We call this task Occlusion-Ordered Semantic Instance Segmentation (OOSIS). We develop an approach to OOSIS that extracts instances and their occlusion order simultaneously from oriented occlusion boundaries and semantic segmentation. Unlike popular detect-and-segment framework for instance segmentation, combining occlusion ordering with instance segmentation allows a simple and clean formulation of OOSIS as a labeling problem. As a part of our solution for OOSIS, we develop a novel oriented occlusion boundaries approach that significantly outperforms prior work. We also develop a new joint OOSIS metric based both on instance mask accuracy and correctness of their occlusion order. We achieve better performance than strong baselines on KINS and COCOA datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Although publicly available procedures of routine surgeries exist, they often lack comprehensive annotations for tool instance segmentation. Additionally, the majority of standard datasets for tool segmentation are derived from porcine(pig) surgeries. To address this gap, we introduce CholecInstanceSeg, the largest open-access tool instance segmentation dataset to date. Derived from the existing CholecT50 and Cholec80 datasets, CholecInstanceSeg provides novel annotations for laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures in patients. Our dataset comprises 41.9k annotated frames extracted from 85 clinical procedures and 64.4k tool instances, each labelled with semantic masks and instance IDs. To ensure the reliability of our annotations, we perform extensive quality control, conduct label agreement statistics, and benchmark the segmentation results with various instance segmentation baselines. CholecInstanceSeg aims to advance the field by offering a comprehensive and high-quality open-access dataset for the development and evaluation of tool instance segmentation algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Single-shot Star-convex Polygon-based Instance Segmentation for Spatially-correlated Biomedical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12078v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical images often contain objects known to be spatially correlated or nested due to their inherent properties, leading to semantic relations. Examples include cell nuclei being nested within eukaryotic cells and colonies growing exclusively within their culture dishes. While these semantic relations bear key importance, detection tasks are often formulated independently, requiring multi-shot analysis pipelines. Importantly, spatial correlation could constitute a fundamental prior facilitating learning of more meaningful representations for tasks like instance segmentation. This knowledge has, thus far, not been utilised by the biomedical computer vision community. We argue that the instance segmentation of two or more categories of objects can be achieved in parallel. We achieve this via two architectures HydraStarDist (HSD) and the novel (HSD-WBR) based on the widely-used StarDist (SD), to take advantage of the star-convexity of our target objects. HSD and HSD-WBR are constructed to be capable of incorporating their interactions as constraints into account. HSD implicitly incorporates spatial correlation priors based on object interaction through a joint encoder. HSD-WBR further enforces the prior in a regularisation layer with the penalty we proposed named Within Boundary Regularisation Penalty (WBR). Both architectures achieve nested instance segmentation in a single shot. We demonstrate their competitiveness based on $IoU_R$ and AP and superiority in a new, task-relevant criteria, Joint TP rate (JTPR) compared to their baseline SD and Cellpose. Our approach can be further modified to capture partial-inclusion/-exclusion in multi-object interactions in fluorescent or brightfield microscopy or digital imaging. Finally, our strategy suggests gains by making this learning single-shot and computationally efficient.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[CAGS: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding with Context-Aware Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11893v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding is crucial for applications requiring natural language-driven spatial interpretation, such as robotics and augmented reality. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a powerful representation for scene reconstruction, integrating it with open-vocabulary frameworks reveals a key challenge: cross-view granularity inconsistency. This issue, stemming from 2D segmentation methods like SAM, results in inconsistent object segmentations across views (e.g., a "coffee set" segmented as a single entity in one view but as "cup + coffee + spoon" in another). Existing 3DGS-based methods often rely on isolated per-Gaussian feature learning, neglecting the spatial context needed for cohesive object reasoning, leading to fragmented representations. We propose Context-Aware Gaussian Splatting (CAGS), a novel framework that addresses this challenge by incorporating spatial context into 3DGS. CAGS constructs local graphs to propagate contextual features across Gaussians, reducing noise from inconsistent granularity, employs mask-centric contrastive learning to smooth SAM-derived features across views, and leverages a precomputation strategy to reduce computational cost by precomputing neighborhood relationships, enabling efficient training in large-scale scenes. By integrating spatial context, CAGS significantly improves 3D instance segmentation and reduces fragmentation errors on datasets like LERF-OVS and ScanNet, enabling robust language-guided 3D scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach, combining explicit modeling with neural adaptability to provide efficient and detailed scene representations. However, three major challenges remain in leveraging 3DGS for scene understanding: 1) an imbalance between appearance and semantics, where dense Gaussian usage for fine-grained texture modeling does not align with the minimal requirements for semantic attributes; 2) inconsistencies between appearance and semantics, as purely appearance-based Gaussians often misrepresent object boundaries; and 3) reliance on top-down instance segmentation methods, which struggle with uneven category distributions, leading to over- or under-segmentation. In this work, we propose InstanceGaussian, a method that jointly learns appearance and semantic features while adaptively aggregating instances. Our contributions include: i) a novel Semantic-Scaffold-GS representation balancing appearance and semantics to improve feature representations and boundary delineation; ii) a progressive appearance-semantic joint training strategy to enhance stability and segmentation accuracy; and iii) a bottom-up, category-agnostic instance aggregation approach that addresses segmentation challenges through farthest point sampling and connected component analysis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in category-agnostic, open-vocabulary 3D point-level segmentation, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed representation and training strategies.

While recent methods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on geometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from the point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation for 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images, leading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for estimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method combines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS representations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified network to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets, and NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted class based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part. Finally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to recover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we introduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date, featuring photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real sensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Real-world deployments of our model in robotic tasks underscore its robustness and exceptional sim-to-real transfer capabilities, confirming its substantial practical utility.

The method is fully based on the DETR paradigm and achieves end-to-end inference through iterative and progressive mechanisms to optimize contours. To improve efficiency and accuracy, we develop two novel techniques: sub-contour decoupling mechanisms and contour fine-grained distribution refinement. In the sub-contour decoupling mechanism, we propose a deformable attention-based module that adaptively selects sampling regions based on the current predicted contour, enabling more effective capturing of object boundary information. Additionally, we design a multi-stage optimization process to enhance segmentation precision by progressively refining sub-contours. The contour fine-grained distribution refinement technique aims to further improve the ability to express fine details of contours. These innovations enable Contourformer to achieve stable and precise segmentation for each instance while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Contourformer on multiple benchmark datasets, including SBD, COCO, and KINS. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and inference speed. This work provides a new solution for contour-based instance segmentation tasks and lays a foundation for future research, with the potential to become a strong baseline method in this field.</p></details> |  | None |

However, obtaining accurate 3D models of relevant objects is necessary, and the resulting images often have a gap in realism due to challenges in simulating lighting effects and camera artifacts. We propose using the novel view synthesis method called Gaussian Splatting to address these challenges. We have developed a synthetic data pipeline for generating high-quality context-aware instance segmentation training data for specific objects. This process is fully automated, requiring only a video of the target object. We train a Gaussian Splatting model of the target object and automatically extract the object from the video. Leveraging Gaussian Splatting, we then render the object on a random background image, and monocular depth estimation is employed to place the object in a believable pose. We introduce a novel dataset to validate our approach and show superior performance over other data generation approaches, such as Cut-and-Paste and Diffusion model-based generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference on Robotics, Computer Vision and Intelligent Systems 2025 (ROBOVIS)</p></details> | None |

However, the performance gap compared with fully-supervised algorithms remains large. Previous works generated class-agnostic \textbf{\textit{proposals in an image}} offline and then treated mixed candidates as a single bag, putting a huge burden on multiple instance learning (MIL). In this paper, we introduce Point-to-Box Network (P2BNet), which constructs balanced \textbf{\textit{instance-level proposal bags}} by generating proposals in an anchor-like way and refining the proposals in a coarse-to-fine paradigm. Through further research, we find that the bag of proposals, either at the image level or the instance level, is established on discrete box sampling. This leads the pseudo box estimation into a sub-optimal solution, resulting in the truncation of object boundaries or the excessive inclusion of background. Hence, we conduct a series exploration of discrete-to-continuous optimization, yielding P2BNet++ and Point-to-Mask Network (P2MNet). P2BNet++ conducts an approximately continuous proposal sampling strategy by better utilizing spatial clues. P2MNet further introduces low-level image information to assist in pixel prediction, and a boundary self-prediction is designed to relieve the limitation of the estimated boxes. Benefiting from the continuous object-aware \textbf{\textit{pixel-level perception}}, P2MNet can generate more precise bounding boxes and generalize to segmentation tasks. Our method largely surpasses the previous methods in terms of the mean average precision on COCO, VOC, SBD, and Cityscapes, demonstrating great potential to bridge the performance gap compared with fully supervised tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV | None |

Training data for perception systems cannot cover the wide variety of objects that may appear during deployment. Thus, reliable identification of unknown objects, such as wild animals and untypical obstacles, is critical due to their potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been facilitated by the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. However, a comprehensive understanding of scene dynamics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Development in this area has been lagging, largely due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks. The situation is similar in object detection. While there is interest in detecting and potentially tracking every anomalous object, the availability of dedicated benchmarks is clearly limited. To address this gap, this work extends some commonly used anomaly segmentation benchmarks to include the instance segmentation and object detection tasks.

While current AI-based methods are effective, errors persist, necessitating time-consuming manual corrections, particularly in areas where the quality of cell contours in the image is poor and requires gap filling. This study presents a novel AI-driven approach for refining cell boundary delineation to improve instance-based cell segmentation in SEM images, also reducing the necessity for residual manual correction. A CNN COp-Net is introduced to address gaps in cell contours, effectively filling in regions with deficient or absent information. The network takes as input cell contour probability maps with potentially inadequate or missing information and outputs corrected cell contour delineations. The lack of training data was addressed by generating low integrity probability maps using a tailored PDE. We showcase the efficacy of our approach in augmenting cell boundary precision using both private SEM images from PDX hepatoblastoma tissues and publicly accessible images datasets. The proposed cell contour closing operator exhibits a notable improvement in tested datasets, achieving respectively close to 50% (private data) and 10% (public data) increase in the accurately-delineated cell proportion compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the need for manual corrections was significantly reduced, therefore facilitating the overall digitalization process. Our results demonstrate a notable enhancement in the accuracy of cell instance segmentation, particularly in highly challenging regions where image quality compromises the integrity of cell boundaries, necessitating gap filling. Therefore, our work should ultimately facilitate the study of tumour tissue bioarchitecture in onconanotomy field.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Amodal-Aware Video Instance Segmentation (A2VIS), which incorporates amodal representations to achieve a reliable and comprehensive understanding of both visible and occluded parts of objects in a video. The key intuition is that awareness of amodal segmentation through spatiotemporal dimension enables a stable stream of object information. In scenarios where objects are partially or completely hidden from view, amodal segmentation offers more consistency and less dramatic changes along the temporal axis compared to visible segmentation. Hence, both amodal and visible information from all clips can be integrated into one global instance prototype. To effectively address the challenge of video amodal segmentation, we introduce the spatiotemporal-prior Amodal Mask Head, which leverages visible information intra clips while extracting amodal characteristics inter clips. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that A2VIS excels in both MOT and VIS tasks in identifying and tracking object instances with a keen understanding of their full shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IMAVIS.

Solutions based on multi-view RGB images are attractive due to their scalability and affordability, enabling volumetric measurements that 2D approaches cannot directly capture. While advanced methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown promise, their application has been limited to counting or extracting traits from only a few plants or organs. Furthermore, accurately measuring complex structures like individual wheat heads-essential for studying crop yields-remains particularly challenging due to occlusions and the dense arrangement of crop canopies in field conditions. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising alternative for HTFP due to its high-quality reconstructions and explicit point-based representation. In this paper, we present Wheat3DGS, a novel approach that leverages 3DGS and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D instance segmentation and morphological measurement of hundreds of wheat heads automatically, representing the first application of 3DGS to HTFP. We validate the accuracy of wheat head extraction against high-resolution laser scan data, obtaining per-instance mean absolute percentage errors of 15.1%, 18.3%, and 40.2% for length, width, and volume. We provide additional comparisons to NeRF-based approaches and traditional Muti-View Stereo (MVS), demonstrating superior results. Our approach enables rapid, non-destructive measurements of key yield-related traits at scale, with significant implications for accelerating crop breeding and improving our understanding of wheat development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

We present a decoupled 3D segmentation pipeline to ensure modularity and adaptability to novel 3D representations as well as semantic segmentation foundation models. We first reconstruct a scene with 3D Gaussians and learn class-agnostic features through contrastive supervision from a 2D instance proposal network. These 3D features are then clustered to form coarse object- or part-level masks. Finally, we match each 3D cluster to class-aware masks predicted by a 2D open-vocabulary segmentation model, assigning semantic labels without retraining the 3D representation. Our decoupled design (1) provides a plug-and-play interface for swapping different 2D or 3D modules, (2) ensures multi-object instance segmentation at no extra cost, and (3) leverages rich 3D geometry for robust scene understanding. We evaluate on synthetic and real-world indoor datasets, demonstrating improved performance over comparable NeRF-based pipelines on mIoU and mAcc, particularly for challenging or long-tail classes. We also show how varying the 2D backbone affects the final segmentation, highlighting the modularity of our framework. These results confirm that decoupling 3D mask proposal and semantic classification can deliver flexible, efficient, and open-vocabulary 3D segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CVPR Workshop on Open-World 3D Scene Understanding with Foundation Models</p></details> | None |

However, most existing visual Mamba methods flatten images into 1D sequences using predefined scan orders, which results the model being less capable of utilizing the spatial structural information of the image during the feature extraction process. To address this issue, we proposed a novel visual foundation model called DefMamba. This model includes a multi-scale backbone structure and deformable mamba (DM) blocks, which dynamically adjust the scanning path to prioritize important information, thus enhancing the capture and processing of relevant input features. By combining a deformable scanning(DS) strategy, this model significantly improves its ability to learn image structures and detects changes in object details. Numerous experiments have shown that DefMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in various visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

Current teacher-student frameworks still suffer from performance constraints due to unreliable pseudo-label quality stemming from limited labeled data. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers robust segmentation capabilities at various granularities, directly applying SAM to this task introduces challenges such as class-agnostic predictions and potential over-segmentation. To address these complexities, we carefully integrate SAM into the semi-supervised instance segmentation framework, developing a novel distillation method that effectively captures the precise localization capabilities of SAM without compromising semantic recognition. Furthermore, we incorporate pseudo-label refinement as well as a specialized data augmentation with the refined pseudo-labels, resulting in superior performance. We establish state-of-the-art performance, and provide comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

The QAM obtains high-quality pseudo masks and better measures the mask quality to help reduce the effect of noisy masks, by leveraging the quality-aware multi-mask complementation mechanism. The PC imitates Peer-Assisted Learning to further improve the quality of the low-quality masks with the guidance of the obtained high-quality pseudo masks. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the proposed QAM and PC are effective. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our BoxSeg over the state-of-the-art methods, and illustrate the QAM and PC can be applied to improve other models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Prior2Former -- Evidential Modeling of Mask Transformers for Assumption-Free Open-World Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04841v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In panoptic segmentation, individual instances must be separated within semantic classes. As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where reliability in unseen scenarios is essential. We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of P2F. It achieves the highest ranking in the OoDIS anomaly instance benchmark among methods not using OOD data in any way.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Statistical Guarantees Of False Discovery Rate In Medical Instance Segmentation Tasks Based on Conformal Risk Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04482v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation plays a pivotal role in medical image analysis by enabling precise localization and delineation of lesions, tumors, and anatomical structures. Although deep learning models such as Mask R-CNN and BlendMask have achieved remarkable progress, their application in high-risk medical scenarios remains constrained by confidence calibration issues, which may lead to misdiagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose a robust quality control framework based on conformal prediction theory. This framework innovatively constructs a risk-aware dynamic threshold mechanism that adaptively adjusts segmentation decision boundaries according to clinical requirements.Specifically, we design a \textbf{calibration-aware loss function} that dynamically tunes the segmentation threshold based on a user-defined risk level $\alpha$. Utilizing exchangeable calibration data, this method ensures that the expected FNR or FDR on test data remains below $\alpha$ with high probability. The framework maintains compatibility with mainstream segmentation models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, BlendMask+ResNet-50-FPN) and datasets (PASCAL VOC format) without requiring architectural modifications. Empirical results demonstrate that we rigorously bound the FDR metric marginally over the test set via our developed calibration framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches using adapters consisting of small learnable layers have emerged as an alternative to FFT, achieving comparable performance while maintaining high training efficiency. However, the inflexibility of the adapter with respect to input instances limits its capability of learning task-specific information in diverse downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel PEFT approach, input-Conditioned transFormer, termed iConFormer, that leverages a dynamic adapter conditioned on the input instances. To secure flexible learning ability on input instances in various downstream tasks, we introduce an input-Conditioned Network (iCoN) in the dynamic adapter that enables instance-level feature transformation. To be specific, iCoN generates channel-wise convolutional kernels for each feature and transform it using adaptive convolution process to effectively capture task-specific and fine-grained details tailor to downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that by tuning just 1.6% to 2.8% of the Transformer backbone parameters, iConFormer achieves performance comparable to FFT in monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation, while outperforming it in image classification and instance segmentation. Also, the proposed method consistently outperforms recent PEFT methods for all the tasks mentioned above.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we address a novel task: rip current instance segmentation. We introduce a comprehensive dataset containing $2,466$ images with newly created polygonal annotations for instance segmentation, used for training and validation. Additionally, we present a novel dataset comprising $17$ drone videos (comprising about $24K$ frames) captured at $30 FPS$, annotated with both polygons for instance segmentation and bounding boxes for object detection, employed for testing purposes.

However, current methods face challenges due to limited dataset sizes, resolution discrepancies, and diverse environmental conditions. We address this by reformulating the task as instance segmentation and introducing the Field Boundary Instance Segmentation - 22M dataset (FBIS-22M), a large-scale, multi-resolution dataset comprising 672,909 high-resolution satellite image patches (ranging from 0.25 m to 10 m) and 22,926,427 instance masks of individual fields, significantly narrowing the gap between agricultural datasets and those in other computer vision domains. We further propose Delineate Anything, an instance segmentation model trained on our new FBIS-22M dataset. Our proposed model sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving a substantial improvement of 88.5% in mAP@0.5 and 103% in mAP@0.5:0.95 over existing methods, while also demonstrating significantly faster inference and strong zero-shot generalization across diverse image resolutions and unseen geographic regions.

Accurate identification of rip currents remains challenging due to their amorphous nature and the lack of annotated data, which often requires expert knowledge. To address these issues, we present RipVIS, a large-scale video instance segmentation benchmark explicitly designed for rip current segmentation. RipVIS is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets, featuring $184$ videos ($212,328$ frames), of which $150$ videos ($163,528$ frames) are with rip currents, collected from various sources, including drones, mobile phones, and fixed beach cameras. Our dataset encompasses diverse visual contexts, such as wave-breaking patterns, sediment flows, and water color variations, across multiple global locations, including USA, Mexico, Costa Rica, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Romania, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand. Most videos are annotated at $5$ FPS to ensure accuracy in dynamic scenarios, supplemented by an additional $34$ videos ($48,800$ frames) without rip currents. We conduct comprehensive experiments with Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, SparseInst and YOLO11, fine-tuning these models for the task of rip current segmentation. Results are reported in terms of multiple metrics, with a particular focus on the $F_2$ score to prioritize recall and reduce false negatives. To enhance segmentation performance, we introduce a novel post-processing step based on Temporal Confidence Aggregation (TCA). RipVIS aims to set a new standard for rip current segmentation, contributing towards safer beach environments.

Each image necessitates multiple annotations, encompassing not only the object class but also its precise spatial boundaries. These requirements elevate the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies in both manual and automated annotation processes. By simulating different noise conditions, we provide a realistic scenario for assessing the robustness and generalization capabilities of instance segmentation models in different segmentation tasks, introducing COCO-N and Cityscapes-N. We also propose a benchmark for weakly annotation noise, dubbed COCO-WAN, which utilizes foundation models and weak annotations to simulate semi-automated annotation tools and their noisy labels. This study sheds light on the quality of segmentation masks produced by various models and challenges the efficacy of popular methods designed to address learning with label noise.</p></details> |  | None |

With the advent of the foundational Segment Anything Model (SAM), the accuracy and efficiency of nuclear segmentation have improved significantly. However, SAM imposes a strong reliance on precise prompts, and its class-agnostic design renders its classification results entirely dependent on the provided prompts. Therefore, we focus on generating prompts with more accurate localization and classification and propose \textbf{APSeg}, \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{P}rompt model with acquired and injected knowledge for nuclear instance \textbf{Seg}mentation and classification. APSeg incorporates two knowledge-aware modules: (1) Distribution-Guided Proposal Offset Module (\textbf{DG-POM}), which learns distribution knowledge through density map guided, and (2) Category Knowledge Semantic Injection Module (\textbf{CK-SIM}), which injects morphological knowledge derived from category descriptions. We conducted extensive experiments on the PanNuke and CoNSeP datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[Instance Migration Diffusion for Nuclear Instance Segmentation in Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01577v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear instance segmentation plays a vital role in disease diagnosis within digital pathology. However, limited labeled data in pathological images restricts the overall performance of nuclear instance segmentation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation framework Instance Migration Diffusion Model (IM-Diffusion), IM-Diffusion designed to generate more varied pathological images by constructing diverse nuclear layouts and internuclear spatial relationships. In detail, we introduce a Nuclear Migration Module (NMM) which constructs diverse nuclear layouts by simulating the process of nuclear migration. Building on this, we further present an Internuclear-regions Inpainting Module (IIM) to generate diverse internuclear spatial relationships by structure-aware inpainting. On the basis of the above, IM-Diffusion generates more diverse pathological images with different layouts and internuclear spatial relationships, thereby facilitating downstream tasks. Evaluation on the CoNSeP and GLySAC datasets demonstrate that the images generated by IM-Diffusion effectively enhance overall instance segmentation performance.

Existing works have shown that vanilla visual networks are biased toward learning appearance information, \eg texture, to recognize objects. This implicit bias causes the model to fail in detecting novel objects with unseen textures in the open-world setting. To address this challenge, we propose a learning framework, called view-Consistent LeaRning (v-CLR), which aims to enforce the model to learn appearance-invariant representations for robust instance segmentation. In v-CLR, we first introduce additional views for each image, where the texture undergoes significant alterations while preserving the image's underlying structure. We then encourage the model to learn the appearance-invariant representation by enforcing the consistency between object features across different views, for which we obtain class-agnostic object proposals using off-the-shelf unsupervised models that possess strong object-awareness. These proposals enable cross-view object feature matching, greatly reducing the appearance dependency while enhancing the object-awareness. We thoroughly evaluate our method on public benchmarks under both cross-class and cross-dataset settings, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

| **[TraceNet: Segment one thing efficiently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14874v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient single instance segmentation is essential for unlocking features in the mobile imaging applications, such as capture or editing. Existing on-the-fly mobile imaging applications scope the segmentation task to portraits or the salient subject due to the computational constraints. Instance segmentation, despite its recent developments towards efficient networks, is still heavy due to the cost of computation on the entire image to identify all instances. To address this, we propose and formulate a one tap driven single instance segmentation task that segments a single instance selected by a user via a positive tap. This task, in contrast to the broader task of segmenting anything as suggested in the Segment Anything Model \cite{sam}, focuses on efficient segmentation of a single instance specified by the user. To solve this problem, we present TraceNet, which explicitly locates the selected instance by way of receptive field tracing. TraceNet identifies image regions that are related to the user tap and heavy computations are only performed on selected regions of the image. Therefore overall computation cost and memory consumption are reduced during inference. We evaluate the performance of TraceNet on instance IoU average over taps and the proportion of the region that a user tap can fall into for a high-quality single-instance mask. Experimental results on MS-COCO and LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. TraceNet can jointly achieve the efficiency and interactivity, filling in the gap between needs for efficient mobile inference and recent research trend towards multimodal and interactive segmentation models.</p></details> |  | None |

While most recent works leverage geometric primitives to obtain photorealistic 3D scene representations, we propose to leverage them to obtain a compact yet expressive representation. We propose to solve the problem locally on individual objects and leverage the capabilities of instance segmentation methods to scale our solution to full 3D scenes. In doing that, we design a new architecture which efficiently decompose point clouds of arbitrary objects in a compact set of superquadrics. We train our architecture on ShapeNet and we prove its generalization capabilities on object instances extracted from the ScanNet++ dataset as well as on full Replica scenes. Finally, we show how a compact representation based on superquadrics can be useful for a diverse range of downstream applications, including robotic tasks and controllable visual content generation and editing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CellVTA: Enhancing Vision Foundation Models for Accurate Cell Segmentation and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00784v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell instance segmentation is a fundamental task in digital pathology with broad clinical applications. Recently, vision foundation models, which are predominantly based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), have achieved remarkable success in pathology image analysis. However, their improvements in cell instance segmentation remain limited. A key challenge arises from the tokenization process in ViTs, which substantially reduces the spatial resolution of input images, leading to suboptimal segmentation quality, especially for small and densely packed cells. To address this problem, we propose CellVTA (Cell Vision Transformer with Adapter), a novel method that improves the performance of vision foundation models for cell instance segmentation by incorporating a CNN-based adapter module. This adapter extracts high-resolution spatial information from input images and injects it into the ViT through a cross-attention mechanism. Our method preserves the core architecture of ViT, ensuring seamless integration with pretrained foundation models. Extensive experiments show that CellVTA achieves 0.538 mPQ on the CoNIC dataset and 0.506 mPQ on the PanNuke dataset, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art cell segmentation methods. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our approach over other fine-tuning strategies, including decoder-only fine-tuning and full fine-tuning.

While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have driven progress in generic image and video synthesis, the domain of controllable VFX generation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for animated VFX generation as image animation, where dynamic effects are generated from user-friendly textual descriptions and static reference images. Our work makes two primary contributions: (i) Open-VFX, the first high-quality VFX video dataset spanning 15 diverse effect categories, annotated with textual descriptions, instance segmentation masks for spatial conditioning, and start-end timestamps for temporal control. (ii) VFX Creator, a simple yet effective controllable VFX generation framework based on a Video Diffusion Transformer. The model incorporates a spatial and temporal controllable LoRA adapter, requiring minimal training videos. Specifically, a plug-and-play mask control module enables instance-level spatial manipulation, while tokenized start-end motion timestamps embedded in the diffusion process, alongside the text encoder, allow precise temporal control over effect timing and pace. Extensive experiments on the Open-VFX test set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in generating realistic and dynamic effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance and generalization ability in both spatial and temporal controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized metric to evaluate the precision of temporal control. By bridging traditional VFX techniques with generative approaches, VFX Creator unlocks new possibilities for efficient and high-quality video effect generation, making advanced VFX accessible to a broader audience.</p></details> |  | None |

By means of 3D point cloud, this modality enables to consider the actual size and spatial understanding. The applied fields include mechanical control of robots, vehicles, or other real-world systems. Along this line, we would like to improve 3D point cloud instance segmentation which has emerged as a particularly promising approach for these applications. However, the creation of 3D point cloud datasets entails enormous costs compared to 2D image datasets. To train a model of 3D point cloud instance segmentation, it is necessary not only to assign categories but also to provide detailed annotations for each point in the large-scale 3D space. Meanwhile, the increase of recent proposals for generative models in 3D domain has spurred proposals for using a generative model to create 3D point cloud data. In this work, we propose a pre-training with 3D synthetic data to train a 3D point cloud instance segmentation model based on generative model for 3D scenes represented by point cloud data. We directly generate 3D point cloud data with Point-E for inserting a generated data into a 3D scene. More recently in 2025, although there are other accurate 3D generation models, even using the Point-E as an early 3D generative model can effectively support the pre-training with 3D synthetic data. In the experimental section, we compare our pre-training method with baseline methods indicated improved performance, demonstrating the efficacy of 3D generative models for 3D point cloud instance segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

With the success of visual foundation models (VFMs) in the image domain, leveraging 2D priors to address 3D online segmentation has become a prominent research focus. Since segmentation results provided by 2D priors often require spatial consistency to be lifted into final 3D segmentation, an efficient method for identifying spatial overlap among 2D masks is essential - yet existing methods rarely achieve this in real time, mainly limiting its use to offline approaches. To address this, we propose an efficient method that lifts 2D masks generated by VFMs into a unified 3D instance using a hashing technique. By employing voxel hashing for efficient 3D scene querying, our approach reduces the time complexity of costly spatial overlap queries from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. Accurate spatial associations further enable 3D merging of 2D masks through simple similarity-based filtering in a zero-shot manner, making our approach more robust to incomplete and noisy data. Evaluated on the ScanNet and SceneNN benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in online, zero-shot 3D instance segmentation with leading efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this approach lacks contextual information for the masked area, often resulting in unstable performance. In this work, we introduce SmartEraser, built with a new removing paradigm called Masked-Region Guidance. This paradigm retains the masked region in the input, using it as guidance for the removal process. It offers several distinct advantages: (a) it guides the model to accurately identify the object to be removed, preventing its regeneration in the output; (b) since the user mask often extends beyond the object itself, it aids in preserving the surrounding context in the final result. Leveraging this new paradigm, we present Syn4Removal, a large-scale object removal dataset, where instance segmentation data is used to copy and paste objects onto images as removal targets, with the original images serving as ground truths. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartEraser significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in object removal, especially in complex scenes with intricate compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project at: https://longtaojiang.github.io/smarteraser.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://longtaojiang.github.io/smarteraser.github.io) |

However, purely SSM-based models face critical challenges related to stability and achieving state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks. Our paper addresses the challenges of scaling SSM-based models for computer vision, particularly the instability and inefficiency of large model sizes. We introduce a parameter-efficient modulated group mamba layer that divides the input channels into four groups and applies our proposed SSM-based efficient Visual Single Selective Scanning (VSSS) block independently to each group, with each VSSS block scanning in one of the four spatial directions. The Modulated Group Mamba layer also wraps the four VSSS blocks into a channel modulation operator to improve cross-channel communication. Furthermore, we introduce a distillation-based training objective to stabilize the training of large models, leading to consistent performance gains. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the merits of the proposed contributions, leading to superior performance over existing methods for image classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection, instance segmentation on MS-COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

The out-of-domain image evaluation shows the generalization capability of models, an essential aspect of real-world applications and an extensively studied topic of domain adaptation. These presented robustness and generalization evaluations are important when designing instance segmentation models for real-world applications and picking an off-the-shelf pretrained model to directly use for the task at hand. Specifically, this benchmark study includes state-of-the-art network architectures, network backbones, normalization layers, models trained starting from scratch versus pretrained networks, and the effect of multi-task training on robustness and generalization. Through this study, we gain several insights. For example, we find that group normalization enhances the robustness of networks across corruptions where the image contents stay the same but corruptions are added on top. On the other hand, batch normalization improves the generalization of the models across different datasets where statistics of image features change. We also find that single-stage detectors do not generalize well to larger image resolutions than their training size. On the other hand, multi-stage detectors can easily be used on images of different sizes. We hope that our comprehensive study will motivate the development of more robust and reliable instance segmentation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, they are limited to reasoning within a specific set of concepts, \ie the vocabulary, prompted by the user at test time. In essence, these models cannot reason in an open-ended fashion, i.e., answering "List the objects in the scene.''. We introduce the first method to address 3D instance segmentation in a setting that is void of any vocabulary prior, namely a vocabulary-free setting. We leverage a large vision-language assistant and an open-vocabulary 2D instance segmenter to discover and ground semantic categories on the posed images. To form 3D instance mask, we first partition the input point cloud into dense superpoints, which are then merged into 3D instance masks. We propose a novel superpoint merging strategy via spectral clustering, accounting for both mask coherence and semantic coherence that are estimated from the 2D object instance masks. We evaluate our method using ScanNet200 and Replica, outperforming existing methods in both vocabulary-free and open-vocabulary settings. Code will be made available.

| **[Foveated Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21854v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation is essential for augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) as it enables precise object recognition and interaction, enhancing the integration of virtual and real-world elements for an immersive experience. However, the high computational overhead of segmentation limits its application on resource-constrained AR/VR devices, causing large processing latency and degrading user experience. In contrast to conventional scenarios, AR/VR users typically focus on only a few regions within their field of view before shifting perspective, allowing segmentation to be concentrated on gaze-specific areas. This insight drives the need for efficient segmentation methods that prioritize processing instance of interest, reducing computational load and enhancing real-time performance. In this paper, we present a foveated instance segmentation (FovealSeg) framework that leverages real-time user gaze data to perform instance segmentation exclusively on instance of interest, resulting in substantial computational savings. Evaluation results show that FSNet achieves an IoU of 0.56 on ADE20K and 0.54 on LVIS, notably outperforming the baseline. The code is available at https://github.com/SAI-</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Complementary Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Dense Image Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13174v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been revealed that small efficient dense image prediction (EDIP) models, trained using the knowledge distillation (KD) framework, encounter two key challenges, including maintaining boundary region completeness and preserving target region connectivity, despite their favorable capacity to recognize main object regions. In this work, we propose a complementary boundary and context distillation (BCD) method within the KD framework for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted knowledge transfer from large accurate teacher models to compact efficient student models. Specifically, the boundary distillation component focuses on extracting explicit object-level semantic boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps of the backbone network to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Concurrently, the context distillation component leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions.

However, due to the nature of the supervisory signal in these paradigms, they lack the ability to learn localized features, leading to degraded performance on dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods have shown the ability to learn granular representations, complementing the high-level features in vision-language training. In this work, we present Harmony, a framework that combines vision-language training with discriminative and generative self-supervision to learn visual features that can be generalized across different vision downstream tasks. Our framework is specifically designed to work on web-scraped data by not relying on negative examples and addressing the one-to-one correspondence issue using soft CLIP targets generated by an EMA model. We comprehensively evaluate Harmony across various vision downstream tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline CLIP and the previously leading joint self and weakly-supervised methods, MaskCLIP and SLIP. Specifically, when comparing against these methods, Harmony shows superior performance in fine-tuning and zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, and both object detection and instance segmentation on MS-COCO, when pre-training a ViT-B on CC3M. We also show that Harmony outperforms other self-supervised learning methods like iBOT and MAE across all tasks evaluated.

| **[Assessing SAM for Tree Crown Instance Segmentation from Drone Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20199v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The potential of tree planting as a natural climate solution is often undermined by inadequate monitoring of tree planting projects. Current monitoring methods involve measuring trees by hand for each species, requiring extensive cost, time, and labour. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping and characterizing trees from aerial imagery, and large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), may be a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare SAM methods for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery of young tree plantations. We explore the potential of SAM for this task, and find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts, but that there is potential for methods which tune SAM further. We also show that predictions can be improved by adding Digital Surface Model (DSM) information as an input.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 ML4RS workshop</p></details> | None |

Our core contribution includes redesigning the Mamba formulation to enhance its capability for efficient modeling of visual features. Through a comprehensive ablation study, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Vision Transformers (ViT) with Mamba. Our results show that equipping the Mamba architecture with self-attention blocks in the final layers greatly improves its capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. Based on these findings, we introduce a family of MambaVision models with a hierarchical architecture to meet various design criteria. For classification on the ImageNet-1K dataset, MambaVision variants achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of both Top-1 accuracy and throughput.

However, current method primarily focus on object-centric representations, supporting object segmentation or detection, while understanding semantic relationships between objects remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose RelationField, the first method to extract inter-object relationships directly from neural radiance fields. RelationField represents relationships between objects as pairs of rays within a neural radiance field, effectively extending its formulation to include implicit relationship queries. To teach RelationField complex, open-vocabulary relationships, relationship knowledge is distilled from multi-modal LLMs. To evaluate RelationField, we solve open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation tasks and relationship-guided instance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks.

| **[CKD: Contrastive Knowledge Distillation from A Sample-wise Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14109v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective contrastive knowledge distillation framework that achieves sample-wise logit alignment while preserving semantic consistency. Conventional knowledge distillation approaches exhibit over-reliance on feature similarity per sample, which risks overfitting, and contrastive approaches focus on inter-class discrimination at the expense of intra-sample semantic relationships. Our approach transfers "dark knowledge" through teacher-student contrastive alignment at the sample level. Specifically, our method first enforces intra-sample alignment by directly minimizing teacher-student logit discrepancies within individual samples. Then, we utilize inter-sample contrasts to preserve semantic dissimilarities across samples. By redefining positive pairs as aligned teacher-student logits from identical samples and negative pairs as cross-sample logit combinations, we reformulate these dual constraints into an InfoNCE loss framework, reducing computational complexity lower than sample squares while eliminating dependencies on temperature parameters and large batch sizes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across three benchmark datasets, including the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and MS COCO datasets, and experimental results clearly confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiscale Feature Importance-based Bit Allocation for End-to-End Feature Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19278v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) aims to compress intermediate features effectively for remote intelligent analytics, which is crucial for future intelligent visual applications. In this paper, we propose a Multiscale Feature Importance-based Bit Allocation (MFIBA) for end-to-end FCM. First, we find that the importance of features for machine vision tasks varies with the scales, object size, and image instances. Based on this finding, we propose a Multiscale Feature Importance Prediction (MFIP) module to predict the importance weight for each scale of features. Secondly, we propose a task loss-rate model to establish the relationship between the task accuracy losses of using compressed features and the bitrate of encoding these features. Finally, we develop a MFIBA for end-to-end FCM, which is able to assign coding bits of multiscale features more reasonably based on their importance. Experimental results demonstrate that when combined with a retained Efficient Learned Image Compression (ELIC), the proposed MFIBA achieves an average of 38.202% bitrate savings in object detection compared to the anchor ELIC. Moreover, the proposed MFIBA achieves an average of 17.212% and 36.492% feature bitrate savings for instance segmentation and keypoint detection, respectively. When the proposed MFIBA is applied to the LIC-TCM, it achieves an average of 18.103%, 19.866% and 19.597% bit rate savings on three machine vision tasks, respectively, which validates the proposed MFIBA has good generalizability and adaptability to different machine vision tasks and FCM base codecs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NextStop: An Improved Tracker For Panoptic LIDAR Segmentation Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06235v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D panoptic LiDAR segmentation is essential for scene understanding in autonomous driving and robotics, combining semantic and instance segmentation with temporal consistency. Current methods, like 4D-PLS and 4D-STOP, use a tracking-by-detection methodology, employing deep learning networks to perform semantic and instance segmentation on each frame. To maintain temporal consistency, large-size instances detected in the current frame are compared and associated with instances within a temporal window that includes the current and preceding frames. However, their reliance on short-term instance detection, lack of motion estimation, and exclusion of small-sized instances lead to frequent identity switches and reduced tracking performance. We address these issues with the NextStop1 tracker, which integrates Kalman filter-based motion estimation, data association, and lifespan management, along with a tracklet state concept to improve prioritization. Evaluated using the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric on the SemanticKITTI validation set, NextStop demonstrated enhanced tracking performance, particularly for small-sized objects like people and bicyclists, with fewer ID switches, earlier tracking initiation, and improved reliability in complex environments.

A detailed, pixel-level understanding of hands and surgical tools is crucial for interpreting a surgeon's actions and intentions. We introduce EgoSurgery-HTS, a new dataset with pixel-wise annotations and a benchmark suite for segmenting surgical tools, hands, and interacting tools in egocentric open-surgery videos. Specifically, we provide a labeled dataset for (1) tool instance segmentation of 14 distinct surgical tools, (2) hand instance segmentation, and (3) hand-tool segmentation to label hands and the tools they manipulate. Using EgoSurgery-HTS, we conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art segmentation methods and demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of hand and hand-tool segmentation in egocentric open-surgery videos compared to existing datasets.

However, despite their potential, these models often overlook the crucial role of high-resolution digital surface models (DSMs) in understanding urban environments, particularly for building-level analysis, which is essential for applications like digital twins. To address this gap, we introduce HiRes-FusedMIM, a novel pre-trained model specifically designed to leverage the rich information contained within high-resolution RGB and DSM data. HiRes-FusedMIM utilizes a dual-encoder simple masked image modeling (SimMIM) architecture with a multi-objective loss function that combines reconstruction and contrastive objectives, enabling it to learn powerful, joint representations from both modalities. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of HiRes-FusedMIM on a diverse set of downstream tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Our results demonstrate that: 1) HiRes-FusedMIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art geospatial methods on several building-related datasets, including WHU Aerial and LoveDA, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing and leveraging fine-grained building information; 2) Incorporating DSMs during pre-training consistently improves performance compared to using RGB data alone, highlighting the value of elevation information for building-level analysis; 3) The dual-encoder architecture of HiRes-FusedMIM, with separate encoders for RGB and DSM data, significantly outperforms a single-encoder model on the Vaihingen segmentation task, indicating the benefits of learning specialized representations for each modality. To facilitate further research and applications in this direction, we will publicly release the trained model weights.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies tackle this problem by developing re-weighting and re-sampling methods, that utilise the class frequencies of the dataset. However, these techniques focus solely on the frequency statistics and ignore the distribution of the classes in image space, missing important information. In contrast to them, we propose FRActal CALibration (FRACAL): a novel post-calibration method for long-tailed object detection. FRACAL devises a logit adjustment method that utilises the fractal dimension to estimate how uniformly classes are distributed in image space. During inference, it uses the fractal dimension to inversely downweight the probabilities of uniformly spaced class predictions achieving balance in two axes: between frequent and rare categories, and between uniformly spaced and sparsely spaced classes. FRACAL is a post-processing method and it does not require any training, also it can be combined with many off-the-shelf models such as one-stage sigmoid detectors and two-stage instance segmentation models. FRACAL boosts the rare class performance by up to 8.6% and surpasses all previous methods on LVIS dataset, while showing good generalisation to other datasets such as COCO, V3Det and OpenImages.

Among these, generative self-supervised vision learning approaches such as MAE and BEiT show promising performance. However, their global masked reconstruction mechanism is computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose local masked reconstruction (LoMaR), a simple yet effective approach that performs masked reconstruction within a small window of 7$\times$7 patches on a simple Transformer encoder, improving the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy compared to global masked reconstruction over the entire image. Extensive experiments show that LoMaR reaches 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming MAE by 0.5%. After finetuning the pretrained LoMaR on 384$\times$384 images, it can reach 85.4% top-1 accuracy, surpassing MAE by 0.6%. On MS COCO, LoMaR outperforms MAE by 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{box}$ on object detection and 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{mask}$ on instance segmentation. LoMaR is especially more computation-efficient on pretraining high-resolution images, e.g., it is 3.1$\times$ faster than MAE with 0.2% higher classification accuracy on pretraining 448$\times$448 images. This local masked reconstruction learning mechanism can be easily integrated into any other generative self-supervised learning approach.

However, the lack of temporal knowledge in the pre-trained model introduces a domain gap which may adversely affect the VIS performance. To effectively bridge this gap, we present a novel video pre-training approach to enhance VIS models, especially for videos with intricate instance relationships. Our crucial innovation focuses on reducing disparities between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Specifically, we first introduce consistent pseudo-video augmentations to create diverse pseudo-video samples for pre-training while maintaining the instance consistency across frames. Then, we incorporate a multi-scale temporal module to enhance the model's ability to model temporal relations through self- and cross-attention at short- and long-term temporal spans. Our approach does not set constraints on model architecture and can integrate seamlessly with various VIS methods. Experiment results on commonly adopted VIS benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a notable 4.0% increase in average precision on the challenging OVIS dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5figures, 6 tables, Accepted to ICME 2025</p></details> | None |

This conventional approach, however, overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both the encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon: a framework-agnostic adaptation to convert an encoder-only self-supervised learning (SSL) contrastive approach to an efficient encoder-decoder framework that can be pre-trained in a contrastive manner. We first update the existing architecture to accommodate a decoder and its respective contrastive loss. We then introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives that facilitates the joint encoder-decoder architecture pre-training. We adapt two established contrastive SSL frameworks tailored for dense prediction tasks, achieve new state-of-the-art results in COCO object detection and instance segmentation, and match state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. We show that our approach allows for pre-training a decoder and enhances the representation power of the encoder and its performance in dense prediction tasks. This benefit holds across heterogeneous decoder architectures between pre-training and fine-tuning and persists in out-of-domain, limited-data scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

It is important for energy and cost-efficient operation of industrial crane manipulators, such as those used to collect tree logs from the forest floor and on forest machines. In this work, we used synthetic data from physics simulations to explore how data-driven modeling can be used to infer multi-object grasp poses from images. We showed that convolutional neural networks can be trained specifically for synthesizing multi-object grasps. Using RGB-Depth images and instance segmentation masks as input, a U-Net model outputs grasp maps with the corresponding grapple orientation and opening width. Given an observation of a pile of logs, the model can be used to synthesize and rate the possible grasp poses and select the most suitable one, with the possibility to respect changing operational constraints such as lift capacity and reach. When tested on previously unseen data, the proposed model found successful grasp poses with an accuracy up to 96%.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures | None |

However, the current implementation of UDC causes serious degradation. The incident light required for camera imaging undergoes attenuation and diffraction when passing through the display panel, leading to various artifacts in UDC imaging. Presently, the prevailing UDC image restoration methods predominantly utilize convolutional neural network architectures, whereas Transformer-based methods have exhibited superior performance in the majority of image restoration tasks. This is attributed to the Transformer's capability to sample global features for the local reconstruction of images, thereby achieving high-quality image restoration. In this paper, we observe that when using the Vision Transformer for UDC degraded image restoration, the global attention samples a large amount of redundant information and noise. Furthermore, compared to the ordinary Transformer employing dense attention, the Transformer utilizing sparse attention can alleviate the adverse impact of redundant information and noise. Building upon this discovery, we propose a Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer method (SGSFormer) for the task of restoring high-quality images from UDC degraded images. Specifically, we utilize sparse self-attention to filter out redundant information and noise, directing the model's attention to focus on the features more relevant to the degraded regions in need of reconstruction. Moreover, we integrate the instance segmentation map as prior information to guide the sparse self-attention in filtering and focusing on the correct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> | None |

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) show remarkable performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, very few have been proposed for instance segmentation in vision-based autonomous driving. Moreover, existing methods rely on suboptimal baselines, which severely limits performance. We introduce \textbf{UDA4Inst}, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through \textit{Semantic Category Training} and \textit{Bidirectional Mixing Training}. With the Semantic Category Training method, semantically related classes are grouped and trained separately, enabling the generation of higher-quality pseudo-labels and improved segmentation performance. We further propose a bidirectional cross-domain data mixing strategy that combines instance-wise and patch-wise mixing techniques to effectively utilize data from both source and target domains, producing realistic composite images that improve the model's generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes benchmark with mAP 31.3. Notably, we are the first to report results on multiple novel synth-to-real instance segmentation datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as source domains while Cityscapes and KITTI360 serve as target domains.

However, traditional methods often treat them as separate tasks, leading to suboptimal performance, spatio-temporal inconsistencies, and inefficiency in complex scenarios due to the absence of information sharing. This paper proposes a multi-task SemanticFlow framework to simultaneously predict scene flow and instance segmentation of full-resolution point clouds. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a coarse-to-fine prediction based multi-task scheme, where an initial coarse segmentation of static backgrounds and dynamic objects is used to provide contextual information for refining motion and semantic information through a shared feature processing module; 2) developing a set of loss functions to enhance the performance of scene flow estimation and instance segmentation, while can help ensure spatial and temporal consistency of both static and dynamic objects within traffic scenes; 3) developing a self-supervised learning scheme, which utilizes coarse segmentation to detect rigid objects and compute their transformation matrices between sequential frames, enabling the generation of self-supervised labels. The proposed framework is validated on the Argoverse and Waymo datasets, demonstrating superior performance in instance segmentation accuracy, scene flow estimation, and computational efficiency, establishing a new benchmark for self-supervised methods in dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Once initialized, this model can then directly extract segmentation masks, allowing processing of image streams in real time with minimal computational overhead. Tracks can be updated online as needed by generating new structured descriptions and corresponding open-vocabulary detections. This combines the descriptive power of VLMs with the grounding capability of OVD and the pixel-level understanding and speed of video segmentation.

Existing methods rely on direct matching for end-to-end lifting, yielding inferior results; or employ a two-stage solution constrained by complex pre- or post-processing. In this work, we design a new end-to-end object-aware lifting approach, named Unified-Lift that provides accurate 3D segmentation based on the 3D Gaussian representation. To start, we augment each Gaussian point with an additional Gaussian-level feature learned using a contrastive loss to encode instance information. Importantly, we introduce a learnable object-level codebook to account for individual objects in the scene for an explicit object-level understanding and associate the encoded object-level features with the Gaussian-level point features for segmentation predictions. While promising, achieving effective codebook learning is non-trivial and a naive solution leads to degraded performance. Therefore, we formulate the association learning module and the noisy label filtering module for effective and robust codebook learning. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks: LERF-Masked, Replica, and Messy Rooms datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative results manifest that our Unified-Lift clearly outperforms existing methods in terms of segmentation quality and time efficiency.

Robots can help to automate this process. To do so, they need to be able to perceive the surrounding environment to identify target objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address the problem of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of apple orchards on 3D data from different sensors. Our approach is able to simultaneously provide semantic segmentation, instance segmentation of trunks and fruits, and instance segmentation of plants (a single trunk with its fruits). This allows us to identify relevant information such as individual plants, fruits, and trunks, and capture the relationship among them, such as precisely estimate the number of fruits associated to each tree in an orchard. Additionally, to efficiently evaluate our approach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, we provide a dataset designed specifically for this task. Our dataset is recorded in Bonn in a real apple orchard with a variety of sensors, spanning from a terrestrial laser scanner to a RGB-D camera mounted on different robotic platforms. The experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in 3D panoptic segmentation in the agricultural domain, while also providing full hierarchical panoptic segmentation. Our dataset has been made publicly available at https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/hops/.

| **[COIN: Confidence Score-Guided Distillation for Annotation-Free Cell Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11439v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell instance segmentation (CIS) is crucial for identifying individual cell morphologies in histopathological images, providing valuable insights for biological and medical research. While unsupervised CIS (UCIS) models aim to reduce the heavy reliance on labor-intensive image annotations, they fail to accurately capture cell boundaries, causing missed detections and poor performance. Recognizing the absence of error-free instances as a key limitation, we present COIN (COnfidence score-guided INstance distillation), a novel annotation-free framework with three key steps: (1) Increasing the sensitivity for the presence of error-free instances via unsupervised semantic segmentation with optimal transport, leveraging its ability to discriminate spatially minor instances, (2) Instance-level confidence scoring to measure the consistency between model prediction and refined mask and identify highly confident instances, offering an alternative to ground truth annotations, and (3) Progressive expansion of confidence with recursive self-distillation. Extensive experiments across six datasets show COIN outperforming existing UCIS methods, even surpassing semi- and weakly-supervised approaches across all metrics on the MoNuSeg and TNBC datasets.

However, it requires laborious human efforts to annotate the point cloud for training a segmentation model. To address this challenge, we propose a YoCo framework, which generates 3D pseudo labels using minimal coarse click annotations in the bird's eye view plane. It is a significant challenge to produce high-quality pseudo labels from sparse annotations. Our YoCo framework first leverages vision foundation models combined with geometric constraints from point clouds to enhance pseudo label generation. Second, a temporal and spatial-based label updating module is designed to generate reliable updated labels. It leverages predictions from adjacent frames and utilizes the inherent density variation of point clouds (dense near, sparse far). Finally, to further improve label quality, an IoU-guided enhancement module is proposed, replacing pseudo labels with high-confidence and high-IoU predictions. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate YoCo's effectiveness and generality, achieving state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised methods and surpassing fully supervised Cylinder3D. Additionally, the YoCo is suitable for various networks, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised methods with minimal fine-tuning using only 0.8% of the fully labeled data, significantly reducing annotation costs.</p></details> |  | None |

These models embed nuclei-specific priors to outperform generic architectures like U-Nets; however, they require large annotated datasets, which are often not available. Generative models (GANs, diffusion models) have been used to compensate for this by synthesizing training data. These two-stage approaches are computationally expensive, as first a generative model and then a segmentation model has to be trained. We propose CyclePose, a hybrid framework integrating synthetic data generation and segmentation training. CyclePose builds on a CycleGAN architecture, which allows unpaired translation between microscopy images and segmentation masks. We embed a segmentation model into CycleGAN and leverage a cycle consistency loss for self-supervision. Without annotated data, CyclePose outperforms other weakly or unsupervised methods on two public datasets.

Despite considerable progress in removing hand-crafted components and simplifying the architecture with transformers, multi-scale feature maps and pyramid designs remain a key factor for their empirical success. In this paper, we show that shifting the multiscale inductive bias into the attention mechanism can work well, resulting in a plain detector `SimPLR' whose backbone and detection head are both non-hierarchical and operate on single-scale features. We find through our experiments that SimPLR with scale-aware attention is plain and simple architecture, yet competitive with multi-scale vision transformer alternatives. Compared to the multi-scale and single-scale state-of-the-art, our model scales better with bigger capacity (self-supervised) models and more pre-training data, allowing us to report a consistently better accuracy and faster runtime for object detection, instance segmentation, as well as panoptic segmentation.

Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach, SAS, to integrate the open vocabulary capability of multiple 2D models and migrate it to 3D domain. Specifically, we first propose Model Alignment via Text to map different 2D models into the same embedding space using text as a bridge. Then, we propose Annotation-Free Model Capability Construction to explicitly quantify the 2D model's capability of recognizing different categories using diffusion models. Following this, point cloud features from different 2D models are fused with the guide of constructed model capabilities. Finally, the integrated 2D open vocabulary capability is transferred to 3D domain through feature distillation. SAS outperforms previous methods by a large margin across multiple datasets, including ScanNet v2, Matterport3D, and nuScenes, while its generalizability is further validated on downstream tasks, e.g., gaussian segmentation and instance segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing models still face challenges in automatically segmenting personalized instances in dense scenarios, where severe occlusions, scale variations, and background clutter hinder precise instance delineation. To address this, we propose PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot framework for personalized instance segmentation in dense images. We start with developing a new baseline capable of automatically generating instance-level point prompts via proposing a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps, encapsulating spatial distribution of objects in an image. To reduce false positives, we design the Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM), which refines the output of IDM based on an adaptive threshold. Both IDM and PPSM seamlessly integrate into our model-agnostic framework. Furthermore, we introduce a feedback mechanism which enables PerSense to improve the accuracy of density maps by automating the exemplar selection process for density map generation. Finally, to promote algorithmic advances and effective tools for this relatively underexplored task, we introduce PerSense-D, an evaluation benchmark exclusive to personalized instance segmentation in dense images. Our extensive experiments establish PerSense superiority in dense scenarios compared to SOTA approaches. Additionally, our qualitative findings demonstrate the adaptability of our framework to images captured in-the-wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report of PerSense</p></details> | None |
| **[DiffEGG: Diffusion-Driven Edge Generation as a Pixel-Annotation-Free Alternative for Instance Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07982v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise panoptic segmentation relies on pixel-wise instance annotations, but obtaining such datasets is costly. Unsupervised instance segmentation (UIS) eliminates annotation requirements but struggles with adjacent instance merging and single-instance fragmentation, largely due to the limitations of DINO-based backbones which lack strong instance separation cues. Weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation (WPS) reduces annotation costs using sparse labels (e.g., points, boxes), yet these annotations remain expensive and introduce human bias and boundary errors. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEGG (Diffusion-Driven EdGe Generation), a fully annotation-free method that extracts instance-aware features from pretrained diffusion models to generate precise instance edge maps. Unlike DINO-based UIS methods, diffusion models inherently capture fine-grained, instance-aware features, enabling more precise boundary delineation. For WPS, DiffEGG eliminates annotation costs and human bias by operating without any form of manual supervision, addressing the key limitations of prior best methods. Additionally, we introduce RIP, a post-processing technique that fuses DiffEGG's edge maps with segmentation masks in a task-agnostic manner. RIP allows DiffEGG to be seamlessly integrated into various segmentation frameworks. When applied to UIS, DiffEGG and RIP achieve an average $+4.4\text{ AP}$ improvement over prior best UIS methods. When combined with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSS), DiffEGG enables WPS without instance annotations, outperforming prior best point-supervised WPS methods by $+1.7\text{ PQ}$. These results demonstrate that DiffEGG's edge maps serve as a cost-effective, annotation-free alternative to instance annotations, significantly improving segmentation without human intervention.

Promising shape representations enable computers to interpret a shape with meaningful parts and identify their repeatability. However, supervised shape representations depend on costly annotation efforts, while current unsupervised methods work under strong semantic priors and involve multi-stage training, thereby limiting their generalization and deployment in shape reasoning and understanding. Driven by the tendency of high-dimensional semantically similar features to lie in or near low-dimensional subspaces, we introduce a one-stage, fully unsupervised framework towards semantic-aware shape representation. This framework produces joint instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and shape abstraction through sparse representation and feature alignment of object parts in a high-dimensional space. For sparse representation, we devise a sparse latent membership pursuit method that models each object part feature as a sparse convex combination of point features at either the semantic or instance level, promoting part features in the same subspace to exhibit similar semantics. For feature alignment, we customize an attention-based strategy in the feature space to align instance- and semantic-level object part features and reconstruct the input shape using both of them, ensuring geometric reusability and semantic consistency of object parts. To firm up semantic disambiguation, we construct cascade unfrozen learning on geometric parameters of object parts.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 15 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[SAQ-SAM: Semantically-Aligned Quantization for Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06515v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot segmentation capability; however, its prohibitive computational costs make edge deployment challenging. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) offers a promising compression solution, existing methods yield unsatisfactory results when applied to SAM, owing to its specialized model components and promptable workflow: (i) The mask decoder's attention exhibits extreme outliers, and we find that aggressive clipping (ranging down to even 100$\times$), instead of smoothing or isolation, is effective in suppressing outliers while maintaining semantic capabilities. Unfortunately, traditional metrics (e.g., MSE) fail to provide such large-scale clipping. (ii) Existing reconstruction methods potentially neglect prompts' intention, resulting in distorted visual encodings during prompt interactions. To address the above issues, we propose SAQ-SAM in this paper, which boosts PTQ of SAM with semantic alignment. Specifically, we propose Perceptual-Consistency Clipping, which exploits attention focus overlap as clipping metric, to significantly suppress outliers. Furthermore, we propose Prompt-Aware Reconstruction, which incorporates visual-prompt interactions by leveraging cross-attention responses in mask decoder, thus facilitating alignment in both distribution and semantics. To ensure the interaction efficiency, we also introduce a layer-skipping strategy for visual tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted on different segmentation tasks and SAMs of various sizes, and the results show that the proposed SAQ-SAM consistently outperforms baselines. For example, when quantizing SAM-B to 4-bit, our method achieves 11.7% higher mAP than the baseline in instance segmentation task.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing methods require training both front-end detectors and mask decoders jointly, this approach lacks flexibility and fails to leverage the strengths of pre-existing modal detectors. To address this limitation, we propose SAMEO, a novel framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a versatile mask decoder capable of interfacing with various front-end detectors to enable mask prediction even for partially occluded objects. Acknowledging the constraints of limited amodal segmentation datasets, we introduce Amodal-LVIS, a large-scale synthetic dataset comprising 300K images derived from the modal LVIS and LVVIS datasets. This dataset significantly expands the training data available for amodal segmentation research. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach, when trained on the newly extended dataset, including Amodal-LVIS, achieves remarkable zero-shot performance on both COCOA-cls and D2SA benchmarks, highlighting its potential for generalization to unseen scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurate and efficient joint segmentation of point cloud from Panel to Tree and Branch (P2TB) is essential for robotic operations. However, most current segmentation methods focus on single instance segmentation and depend on a sequence of deep networks to perform joint tasks. This strategy hinders the use of hierarchical information embedded in the data, leading to both error accumulation and increased costs for annotation and computation, which limits its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we proposed a novel approach that incorporated a Real2Sim L-TreeGen for training data generation and a joint model (J-P2TB) designed for the P2TB task. The J-P2TB model, trained on the generated simulation dataset, was used for joint segmentation of real-world panel point clouds via zero-shot learning. Compared to representative methods, our model outperformed them in most segmentation metrics while using 40% fewer learnable parameters. This Sim2Real result highlighted the efficacy of L-TreeGen in model training and the performance of J-P2TB for joint segmentation, demonstrating its strong accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability for real-world applications. These improvements would not only greatly benefit the development of robots for automated orchard operations but also advance digital twin technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional phenotyping mainly relies on manual measurement, which is accurate but inefficient, more importantly, endangering the health and safety of people. Several studies have explored computer vision-based methods to replace manual phenotyping. However, the 2D-based need extra calibration, or cause destruction to fruit, or can only measure limited and meaningless traits. The 3D-based need extra depth camera, which is expensive and unacceptable for most farmers. In this paper, we propose a non-contact tomato fruit phenotyping method, titled TomatoScanner, where RGB image is all you need for input. First, pixel feature is extracted by instance segmentation of our proposed EdgeYOLO with preprocessing of individual separation and pose correction. Second, depth feature is extracted by depth estimation of Depth Pro. Third, pixel and depth feature are fused to output phenotype results in reality. We establish self-built Tomato Phenotype Dataset to test TomatoScanner, which achieves excellent phenotyping on width, height, vertical area and volume, with median relative error of 5.63%, 7.03%, -0.64% and 37.06%, respectively. We propose and add three innovative modules - EdgeAttention, EdgeLoss and EdgeBoost - into EdgeYOLO, to enhance the segmentation accuracy on edge portion. Precision and mean Edge Error greatly improve from 0.943 and 5.641% to 0.986 and 2.963%, respectively. Meanwhile, EdgeYOLO keeps lightweight and efficient, with 48.7 M weights size and 76.34 FPS.

However, SAM primarily relies on sparse prompts such as point or bounding box, which may be suboptimal for fine-grained instance segmentation, particularly in endoscopic imagery, where precise localization is critical and existing prompts struggle to capture object boundaries effectively. To address this, we introduce S4M (Segment Anything with 4 Extreme Points), which augments SAM by leveraging extreme points -- the top-, bottom-, left-, and right-most points of an instance -- prompts. These points are intuitive to identify and provide a faster, structured alternative to box prompts. However, a na\"ive use of extreme points degrades performance, due to SAM's inability to interpret their semantic roles. To resolve this, we introduce dedicated learnable embeddings, enabling the model to distinguish extreme points from generic free-form points and better reason about their spatial relationships. We further propose an auxiliary training task through the Canvas module, which operates solely on prompts -- without vision input -- to predict a coarse instance mask. This encourages the model to internalize the relationship between extreme points and mask distributions, leading to more robust segmentation. S4M outperforms other SAM-based approaches on three endoscopic surgical datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex scenarios. Finally, we validate our approach through a human annotation study on surgical endoscopic videos, confirming that extreme points are faster to acquire than bounding boxes.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we propose QueryCAD, the first system designed for CAD question answering, enabling the extraction of precise information from CAD models using natural language queries. QueryCAD incorporates SegCAD, an open-vocabulary instance segmentation model we developed to identify and select specific parts of the CAD model based on part descriptions. We further propose a CAD question answering benchmark to evaluate QueryCAD and establish a foundation for future research.

In this paper, we consider the problem of synchronous data collection from the open-source CARLA simulator using multiple sensors attached to vehicle based on user-defined criteria. We propose a novel, one-step framework that we refer to as Car-STAGE, based on CARLA simulator, to generate data using a graphical user interface (GUI) defining configuration parameters to data collection without any user intervention. This framework can utilize the user-defined configuration parameters such as choice of maps, number and configurations of sensors, environmental and lighting conditions etc. to run the simulation in the background, collecting high-dimensional sensor data from diverse sensors such as RGB Camera, LiDAR, Radar, Depth Camera, IMU Sensor, GNSS Sensor, Semantic Segmentation Camera, Instance Segmentation Camera, and Optical Flow Camera along with the ground-truths of the individual actors and storing the sensor data as well as ground-truth labels in a local or cloud-based database. The framework uses multiple threads where a main thread runs the server, a worker thread deals with queue and frame number and the rest of the threads processes the sensor data. The other way we derive speed up over the native implementation is by memory mapping the raw binary data into the disk and then converting the data into known formats at the end of data collection. We show that using these techniques, we gain a significant speed up over frames, under an increasing set of sensors and over the number of spawned objects.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its large storage requirements and high computational cost pose challenges for practical deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective strategy for efficient deployment, but we identify two key challenges in SAM that hinder the effectiveness of existing PTQ methods: the heavy-tailed and skewed distribution of post-GELU activations, and significant inter-channel variation in linear projection activations. To address these challenges, we propose AHCPTQ, an accurate and hardware-efficient PTQ method for SAM. AHCPTQ introduces hardware-compatible Hybrid Log-Uniform Quantization (HLUQ) to manage post-GELU activations, employing log2 quantization for dense small values and uniform quantization for sparse large values to enhance quantization resolution. Additionally, AHCPTQ incorporates Channel-Aware Grouping (CAG) to mitigate inter-channel variation by progressively clustering activation channels with similar distributions, enabling them to share quantization parameters and improving hardware efficiency. The combination of HLUQ and CAG not only enhances quantization effectiveness but also ensures compatibility with efficient hardware execution. For instance, under the W4A4 configuration on the SAM-L model, AHCPTQ achieves 36.6% mAP on instance segmentation with the DINO detector, while achieving a 7.89x speedup and 8.64x energy efficiency over its floating-point counterpart in FPGA implementation.</p></details> |  | None |

This study evaluates the application of a deep learning keypoint and object detection model, YOLOv8-pose, for the automatic identification of localised periodontal bone loss landmarks, conditions and staging. YOLOv8-pose was fine-tuned on 193 annotated periapical radiographs. We propose a keypoint detection metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), which normalises the metric to the average tooth size of teeth in the image. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that adjusts certain keypoint predictions to align with the edge of the related tooth, using a supporting instance segmentation model trained on an open source auxiliary dataset. The model can sufficiently detect bone loss keypoints, tooth boxes, and alveolar ridge resorption, but has insufficient performance at detecting detached periodontal ligament and furcation involvement. The model with post-processing demonstrated a PRCK 0.25 of 0.726 and PRCK 0.05 of 0.401 for keypoint detection, mAP 0.5 of 0.715 for tooth object detection, mesial dice score of 0.593 for periodontal staging, and dice score of 0.280 for furcation involvement. Our annotation methodology provides a stage agnostic approach to periodontal disease detection, by ensuring most keypoints are present for each tooth in the image, allowing small imbalanced datasets. Our PRCK metric allows accurate evaluation of keypoints in dental domains. Our post-processing module adjusts predicted keypoints correctly but is dependent on a minimum quality of prediction by the pose detection and segmentation models.

However, effectively integrating fine-grained perception tasks like detection and segmentation into these models remains a significant challenge. This is primarily because these tasks often rely heavily on task-specific designs and architectures that can complicate the modeling process. To address this challenge, we present \ours, a framework that \textbf{U}nifies \textbf{F}ine-grained visual perception tasks through an \textbf{O}pen-ended language interface. By transforming all perception targets into the language space, \ours unifies object-level detection, pixel-level segmentation, and image-level vision-language tasks into a single model. Additionally, we introduce a novel embedding retrieval approach that relies solely on the language interface to support segmentation tasks. Our framework bridges the gap between fine-grained perception and vision-language tasks, significantly simplifying architectural design and training strategies while achieving comparable or superior performance to methods with intricate task-specific designs. After multi-task training on five standard visual perception datasets, \ours outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generalist models by 12.3 mAP on COCO instance segmentation and 3.3 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation. Furthermore, our method seamlessly integrates with existing MLLMs, effectively combining fine-grained perception capabilities with their advanced language abilities, thereby enabling more challenging tasks such as reasoning segmentation.

In LiDAR panoptic segmentation, this challenge becomes even more pronounced due to the need to simultaneously address both semantic and instance segmentation from complex, high-dimensional point cloud data. In this work, we address the challenge of LiDAR panoptic segmentation with very few labeled samples by leveraging recent advances in label-efficient vision panoptic segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel method, Limited-Label LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation (L3PS), which requires only a minimal amount of labeled data. Our approach first utilizes a label-efficient 2D network to generate panoptic pseudo-labels from a small set of annotated images, which are subsequently projected onto point clouds. We then introduce a novel 3D refinement module that capitalizes on the geometric properties of point clouds. By incorporating clustering techniques, sequential scan accumulation, and ground point separation, this module significantly enhances the accuracy of the pseudo-labels, improving segmentation quality by up to +10.6 PQ and +7.9 mIoU. We demonstrate that these refined pseudo-labels can be used to effectively train off-the-shelf LiDAR segmentation networks. Through extensive experiments, we show that L3PS not only outperforms existing methods but also substantially reduces the annotation burden. We release the code of our work at https://l3ps.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Effective and Efficient Context-aware Nucleus Detection in Histopathology Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05678v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nucleus detection in histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is crucial for a broad spectrum of clinical applications. Current approaches for nucleus detection in gigapixel WSIs utilize a sliding window methodology, which overlooks boarder contextual information (eg, tissue structure) and easily leads to inaccurate predictions. To address this problem, recent studies additionally crops a large Filed-of-View (FoV) region around each sliding window to extract contextual features. However, such methods substantially increases the inference latency. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient context-aware nucleus detection algorithm. Specifically, instead of leveraging large FoV regions, we aggregate contextual clues from off-the-shelf features of historically visited sliding windows. This design greatly reduces computational overhead. Moreover, compared to large FoV regions at a low magnification, the sliding window patches have higher magnification and provide finer-grained tissue details, thereby enhancing the detection accuracy. To further improve the efficiency, we propose a grid pooling technique to compress dense feature maps of each patch into a few contextual tokens. Finally, we craft OCELOT-seg, the first benchmark dedicated to context-aware nucleus instance segmentation. Code, dataset, and model checkpoints will be available at https://github.com/windygoo/PathContext.</p></details> | under review | [Code Link](https://github.com/windygoo/PathContext) |
| **[Rate-Distortion Theory in Coding for Machines and its Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17295v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in both the capability and popularity of automatic machine analysis of images and video. As a result, a growing need for efficient compression methods optimized for machine vision, rather than human vision, has emerged. To meet this growing demand, several methods have been developed for image and video coding for machines. Unfortunately, while there is a substantial body of knowledge regarding rate-distortion theory for human vision, the same cannot be said of machine analysis. In this paper, we extend the current rate-distortion theory for machines, providing insight into important design considerations of machine-vision codecs. We then utilize this newfound understanding to improve several methods for learnable image coding for machines. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several computer vision tasks such as classification, instance segmentation, and object detection.</p></details> |  | None |
