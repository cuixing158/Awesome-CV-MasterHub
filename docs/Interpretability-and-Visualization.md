Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[From the Laboratory to Real-World Application: Evaluating Zero-Shot Scene Interpretation on Edge Devices for Mobile Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02427v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information, allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks, combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape, on-campus and indoor scenarios. The experimental evaluation discusses the potential of these small models on edge devices, with particular emphasis on challenges, weaknesses, inherent model biases and the application of the gained information.

| **[Visual Categorization Across Minds and Models: Cognitive Analysis of Human Labeling and Neuro-Symbolic Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09340v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how humans and AI systems interpret ambiguous visual stimuli offers critical insight into the nature of perception, reasoning, and decision-making. This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations. Such architectures, informed by principles of embodiment, explainability, and cognitive alignment, offer a path toward AI systems that are not only performant but also interpretable and cognitively grounded.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Learning Patient-Specific Disease Dynamics with Latent Flow Matching for Longitudinal Imaging Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09185v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding disease progression is a central clinical challenge with direct implications for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $Δ$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $Δ$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.</p></details> | Under review | None |

We present ARM-Thinker, an A}gentic multimodal Reward Model that autonomously invokes external tools (e.g., image cropping, doc page retrieval) to ground judgments in verifiable evidence, replacing static, non-interactive reward scoring. This enables the model to verify fine-grained visual details, cross-reference multi-page evidence, and validate reasoning claims, which are capabilities absent in existing reward models. We train ARM-Thinker with multi-stage reinforcement learning, jointly optimizing tool-calling decisions and judgment accuracy. To evaluate agentic reward modeling, we introduce ARMBench-VL, comprising three benchmarks that assess fine-grained visual grounding (image-level tools), multi-page document understanding (retrieval tools), and instruction following (text-level verification). ARM-Thinker achieves +16.2% average improvement on reward modeling benchmarks, +9.6% on tool-use tasks, and outperforms baselines on multimodal math and logical reasoning benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that agentic capabilities significantly enhance both accuracy and interpretability of reward models.</p></details> |  | None |

We focus on widespread interactions between clients and (creative) specialists highlighting a change in interaction patterns leading to a shift from the use of expert creativity towards AI-supported client creativity. More specifically, we explore the case of architecture as designing houses is complex involving extensive customer interaction. We investigate the effects of GenAI on the architectural design process and discuss the role of the architect. Our study involved six architects using a general-purpose text-to-image tool for generating designs and providing feedback followed by expert interviews. We find that AI can disrupt the ideation phase by enabling clients to engage in the design process through rapid visualization of their ideas. In turn, so our thesis, the architect's role shifts towards assessing feasibility of such designs. AI's feedback, though valuable, can hamper creativity and innovation by suggesting altering novel, innovative approaches towards more standardized designs. We find that there is uncertainty among architects about the interpretative sovereignty of architecture and identity when AI increasingly takes over authorship. Our findings can also support the design of future AI systems by pinpointing weaknesses and highlighting a novel design process calling for tighter client integration. In our discussion, we also generalize our findings on a broader societal level elaborating on the change of a number of characteristics such as power, capability and responsibility in the triangle of AI, experts, and non-experts. We also discuss risks such as cultural uniformity when it comes to using AI to design artifacts central to our cultural heritage.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[4DLangVGGT: 4D Language-Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05060v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing 4D language fields is crucial for embodied AI, augmented/virtual reality, and 4D scene understanding, as they provide enriched semantic representations of dynamic environments and enable open-vocabulary querying in complex scenarios. However, existing approaches to 4D semantic field construction primarily rely on scene-specific Gaussian splatting, which requires per-scene optimization, exhibits limited generalization, and is difficult to scale to real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose 4DLangVGGT, the first Transformer-based feed-forward unified framework for 4D language grounding, that jointly integrates geometric perception and language alignment within a single architecture. 4DLangVGGT has two key components: the 4D Visual Geometry Transformer, StreamVGGT, which captures spatio-temporal geometric representations of dynamic scenes; and the Semantic Bridging Decoder (SBD), which projects geometry-aware features into a language-aligned semantic space, thereby enhancing semantic interpretability while preserving structural fidelity. Unlike prior methods that depend on costly per-scene optimization, 4DLangVGGT can be jointly trained across multiple dynamic scenes and directly applied during inference, achieving both deployment efficiency and strong generalization. This design significantly improves the practicality of large-scale deployment and establishes a new paradigm for open-vocabulary 4D scene understanding. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our approach not only generalizes effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 2% gains under per-scene training and 1% improvements under multi-scene training.

| **[DAVE: Diagnostic benchmark for Audio Visual Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09321v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual understanding is a rapidly evolving field that seeks to integrate and interpret information from both auditory and visual modalities. Despite recent advances in multi-modal learning, existing benchmarks often suffer from strong visual bias -- when answers can be inferred from visual data alone -- and provide only aggregate scores that conflate multiple sources of error. This makes it difficult to determine whether models struggle with visual understanding, audio interpretation, or audio-visual alignment. In this work, we introduce DAVE: Diagnostic Audio Visual Evaluation, a novel benchmark dataset designed to systematically evaluate audio-visual models across controlled settings. DAVE alleviates existing limitations by (i) ensuring both modalities are necessary to answer correctly and (ii) decoupling evaluation into atomic subcategories. Our detailed analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals specific failure modes and provides targeted insights for improvement. By offering this standardized diagnostic framework, we aim to facilitate more robust development of audio-visual models.

| **[E3AD: An Emotion-Aware Vision-Language-Action Model for Human-Centric End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04733v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (AD) systems increasingly adopt vision-language-action (VLA) models, yet they typically ignore the passenger's emotional state, which is central to comfort and AD acceptance. We introduce Open-Domain End-to-End (OD-E2E) autonomous driving, where an autonomous vehicle (AV) must interpret free-form natural-language commands, infer the emotion, and plan a physically feasible trajectory. We propose E3AD, an emotion-aware VLA framework that augments semantic understanding with two cognitively inspired components: a continuous Valenc-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion model that captures tone and urgency from language, and a dual-pathway spatial reasoning module that fuses egocentric and allocentric views for human-like spatial cognition. A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions. Across real-world datasets, E3AD improves visual grounding and waypoint planning and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) VAD correlation for emotion estimation. These results show that injecting emotion into VLA-style driving yields more human-aligned grounding, planning, and human-centric feedback.</p></details> |  | None |

A key challenge is the lack of model-based design tools, forcing advancement to occur through empirical iteration and observation. Existing models are focused on control and rely on parameter fits, which means they cannot provide general conclusions about the mapping between design and performance or the influence of factors outside the fitting data.As a first step toward model-based design tools, we introduce a novel method of analyzing whether a proposed arm design can complete desired tasks. Our method is informative, interpretable, and fast; it provides novel metrics for quantifying a proposed arm design's ability to perform a task, it yields a graphical interpretation of performance through segment forces, and computing it is over 80x faster than optimization based methods.Our formulation focuses on antagonistic, pneumatically-driven soft arms. We demonstrate our approach through example analysis, and also through consideration of antagonistic vs non-antagonistic designs. Our method enables fast, direct and task-specific comparison of these two architectures, and provides a new visualization of the comparative mechanics. While only a first step, the proposed approach will support advancement of model-based design tools, leading to highly capable soft arms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft 2025).

| **[Explainable Parkinsons Disease Gait Recognition Using Multimodal RGB-D Fusion and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04425v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and interpretable gait analysis plays a crucial role in the early detection of Parkinsons disease (PD),yet most existing approaches remain limited by single-modality inputs, low robustness, and a lack of clinical transparency. This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

| **[MASE: Interpretable NLP Models via Model-Agnostic Saliency Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04386v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their interpretability remains elusive, particularly when evaluating their intricate decision-making processes. Traditional methods often rely on post-hoc interpretations, such as saliency maps or feature visualization, which might not be directly applicable to the discrete nature of word data in NLP. Addressing this, we introduce the Model-agnostic Saliency Estimation (MASE) framework. MASE offers local explanations for text-based predictive models without necessitating in-depth knowledge of a model's internal architecture. By leveraging Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP) on the embedding layer instead of raw word inputs, MASE efficiently estimates input saliency. Our results indicate MASE's superiority over other model-agnostic interpretation methods, especially in terms of Delta Accuracy, positioning it as a promising tool for elucidating the operations of text-based models in NLP.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CMMCoT: Enhancing Complex Multi-Image Comprehension via Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought and Memory Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05255v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While previous multimodal slow-thinking methods have demonstrated remarkable success in single-image understanding scenarios, their effectiveness becomes fundamentally constrained when extended to more complex multi-image comprehension tasks. This limitation stems from their predominant reliance on text-based intermediate reasoning processes. While for human, when engaging in sophisticated multi-image analysis, they typically perform two complementary cognitive operations: (1) continuous cross-image visual comparison through region-of-interest matching, and (2) dynamic memorization of critical visual concepts throughout the reasoning chain. Motivated by these observations, we propose the Complex Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought (CMMCoT) framework, a multi-step reasoning framework that mimics human-like "slow thinking" for multi-image understanding. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) The construction of interleaved multimodal multi-step reasoning chains, which utilize critical visual region tokens, extracted from intermediate reasoning steps, as supervisory signals. This mechanism not only facilitates comprehensive cross-modal understanding but also enhances model interpretability. (2) The introduction of a test-time memory augmentation module that expands the model's reasoning capacity during inference while preserving parameter efficiency. Furthermore, to facilitate research in this direction, we have curated a novel multi-image slow-thinking dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

| **[TraceTrans: Translation and Spatial Tracing for Surgical Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22379v4)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-image translation models have achieved notable success in converting images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such as predicting post-operative outcomes and modeling disease progression. However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source. Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CRAFT-E: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Embodied Affordance Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04231v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assistive robots operating in unstructured environments must understand not only what objects are, but what they can be used for. This requires grounding language-based action queries to objects that both afford the requested function and can be physically retrieved. Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics. By coupling symbolic reasoning with embodied perception, CRAFT-E offers an interpretable and customizable alternative to end-to-end models for affordance-grounded object selection, supporting trustworthy decision-making in assistive robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. 3 figures, 4 tables.

However, achieving semantically controllable dexterous grasp synthesis remains highly challenging due to the lack of unified modeling of multiple semantic dimensions, including grasp taxonomy, contact semantics, and functional affordance. To address these limitations, we present OmniDexVLG, a multimodal, semantics aware grasp generation framework capable of producing structurally diverse and semantically coherent dexterous grasps under joint language and visual guidance. Our approach begins with OmniDexDataGen, a semantic rich dexterous grasp dataset generation pipeline that integrates grasp taxonomy guided configuration sampling, functional affordance contact point sampling, taxonomy aware differential force closure grasp sampling, and physics based optimization and validation, enabling systematic coverage of diverse grasp types. We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world object grasping and ablation studies demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of grasp diversity, contact semantic diversity, functional affordance diversity, and semantic consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://sites.google.com/view/omnidexvlg, 16 pages</p></details> | None |

However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0. These results highlight that jointly scaling prompts and visuals is key to fully leveraging scaling laws at inference-time.

In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+ lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset, which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the "Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability," Track 2: Audio-Visual Detection and Localization (DDL-AV), and won first place in this competition.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is withdrawn after discovering a flaw in the theoretical derivation presented in Section Method.

| **[CellScout: Visual Analytics for Mining Biomarkers in Cell State Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03485v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell state discovery is crucial for understanding biological systems and enhancing medical outcomes. A key aspect of this process is identifying distinct biomarkers that define specific cell states. However, difficulties arise from the co-discovery process of cell states and biomarkers: biologists often use dimensionality reduction to visualize cells in a two- dimensional space. Then they usually interpret visually clustered cells as distinct states, from which they seek to identify unique biomarkers. However, this assumption is often invalid due to internal inconsistencies in a cluster, making the process trial-and-error and highly uncertain. Therefore, biologists urgently need effective tools to help uncover the hidden association relationships between different cell populations and their potential biomarkers. To address this problem, we first designed a machine-learning algorithm based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique to identify meaningful associations between cell populations and biomarkers. We further developed a visual analytics system, CellScout, in collaboration with biologists, to help them explore and refine these association relationships to advance cell state discovery. We validated our system through expert interviews, from which we further selected a representative case to demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering new cell states.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Think Before You Drive: World Model-Inspired Multimodal Grounding for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03454v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting natural-language commands to localize target objects is critical for autonomous driving (AD). Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization.

| **[A Hybrid Deep Learning Framework with Explainable AI for Lung Cancer Classification with DenseNet169 and SVM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03359v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung cancer is a very deadly disease worldwide, and its early diagnosis is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. Computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used for lung cancer diagnosis as they can give detailed lung structures. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and prone to human error. To surmount this challenge, the study proposes a deep learning-based automatic lung cancer classification system to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. The IQOTHNCCD lung cancer dataset is utilized, which is a public CT scan dataset consisting of cases categorized into Normal, Benign, and Malignant and used DenseNet169, which includes Squeezeand-Excitation blocks for attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature fusion. In addition, an SVM model was developed using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, improving its classification performance. For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice. These results open up the potential for deep learning to improve the diagnosis of lung cancer by a higher level of accuracy, transparency, and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

This review examines the development and application of multi-modal language models (MLLMs) in remote sensing, focusing on their ability to interpret and describe satellite imagery using natural language. We cover the technical underpinnings of MLLMs, including dual-encoder architectures, Transformer models, self-supervised and contrastive learning, and cross-modal integration. The unique challenges of remote sensing data--varying spatial resolutions, spectral richness, and temporal changes--are analyzed for their impact on MLLM performance. Key applications such as scene description, object detection, change detection, text-to-image retrieval, image-to-text generation, and visual question answering are discussed to demonstrate their relevance in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster response. We review significant datasets and resources supporting the training and evaluation of these models. Challenges related to computational demands, scalability, data quality, and domain adaptation are highlighted. We conclude by proposing future research directions and technological advancements to further enhance MLLM utility in remote sensing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure | None |

A central limitation stems from the representation gap: understanding typically leverages high-level, language aligned encoders, whereas generation relies on low level, pixel-space autoencoders, resulting in misaligned feature spaces. To bridge this gap, Recent advances such as Representation Autoencoders and BLIP3-o advocate performing diffusion-based modeling directly in high level features from pretrained semantic encoders. We find editing in the semantic latent space modifies conceptual representations rather than pixels, ensuring intermediates that are both semantically coherent and visually plausible. Building on this insight, We propose UniEdit-I, the first training-free, closed-loop image editing framework that operates entirely within the semantic latent space of a unified VLM by introducing an Understanding-Editing-Verifying (UEV) loop, By transforming the VLM from a posthoc evaluator into an in-process conductor, UniEdit-I establishes the first semantics-driven, self-correcting closed-loop image editing pipeline. Evaluated on GEdit-Bench, UniEdit-I achieves state of the art performance without any fine tuning or architectural modifications, and even surpasses several largescale pretrained editors.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Process Reward Models are Symbolic Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03126v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic computer vision represents diagrams through explicit logical rules and structured representations, enabling interpretable understanding in machine vision. This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website is https://carlyx.github.io/MAViD/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://carlyx.github.io/MAViD) |

To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> | None |

However, existing construction methods either depend on labor-intensive expert reasoning or on fully automated systems lacking expert involvement, creating a tension between scalability and interpretability. We introduce \textbf{XISM}, an interactive system that combines data-driven inference with expert knowledge. XISM generates candidate maps via a top-down procedure and allows users to iteratively refine edges in a visual interface, with real-time metric feedback. Experiments in three semantic domains and expert interviews show that XISM improves linguistic decision transparency and controllability in semantic-map construction while maintaining computational efficiency.

However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |

Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.</p></details> |  | None |

In the context of education, these technologies offer new opportunities to study cognitive and affective processes such as engagement, attention, and performance. However, the lack of scalable, synchronized, and high-resolution tools for multimodal data acquisition continues to be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Multimodal Learning Analytics in real-world educational settings. This paper presents two complementary tools developed to address these challenges: Watch-DMLT, a data acquisition application for Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatches that enables real-time, multi-user monitoring of physiological and motion signals; and ViSeDOPS, a dashboard-based visualization system for analyzing synchronized multimodal data collected during oral presentations. We report on a classroom deployment involving 65 students and up to 16 smartwatches, where data streams including heart rate, motion, gaze, video, and contextual annotations were captured and analyzed. Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the proposed system for supporting fine-grained, scalable, and interpretable Multimodal Learning Analytics in real learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality (TEEM) 2025</p></details> | None |

To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce DetAny3D, a promptable 3D detection foundation model capable of detecting any novel object under arbitrary camera configurations using only monocular inputs. Training a foundation model for 3D detection is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of annotated 3D data, which motivates DetAny3D to leverage the rich prior knowledge embedded in extensively pre-trained 2D foundation models to compensate for this scarcity. To effectively transfer 2D knowledge to 3D, DetAny3D incorporates two core modules: the 2D Aggregator, which aligns features from different 2D foundation models, and the 3D Interpreter with Zero-Embedding Mapping, which stabilizes early training in 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Experimental results validate the strong generalization of our DetAny3D, which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen categories and novel camera configurations, but also surpasses most competitors on in-domain data. DetAny3D sheds light on the potential of the 3D foundation model for diverse applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., rare object detection in autonomous driving, and demonstrates promise for further exploration of 3D-centric tasks in open-world settings.

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation. Our source code will be publicly available on GitHub after publishing.</p></details> | Submitted to KDD2026 | None |

However, they encounter significant challenges when processing long videos because of the large number of video frames involved. Downsampling long videos in either space or time can lead to visual hallucinations, making it difficult to accurately interpret long videos. Motivated by human hierarchical temporal search strategies, we propose \textbf{TimeSearch}, a novel framework enabling LVLMs to understand long videos in a human-like manner. TimeSearch integrates two human-like primitives into a unified autoregressive LVLM: 1) \textbf{Spotlight} efficiently identifies relevant temporal events through a Temporal-Augmented Frame Representation (TAFR), explicitly binding visual features with timestamps; 2) \textbf{Reflection} evaluates the correctness of the identified events, leveraging the inherent temporal self-reflection capabilities of LVLMs. TimeSearch progressively explores key events and prioritizes temporal search based on reflection confidence. Extensive experiments on challenging long-video benchmarks confirm that TimeSearch substantially surpasses previous state-of-the-art, improving the accuracy from 41.8\% to 51.5\% on the LVBench. Additionally, experiments on temporal grounding demonstrate that appropriate TAFR is adequate to effectively stimulate the surprising temporal grounding ability of LVLMs in a simpler yet versatile manner, which improves mIoU on Charades-STA by 11.8\%. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

Analyzing and understanding these complex interactions is challenging, and existing analysis methods are limited in their ability to fully reflect and interpret this complexity. To address these challenges, we provide MARLViz, a visual analytics system for visualizing and analyzing the policies and interactions of agents in MARL environments. The system is designed to visually show the difference in behavior of agents under different environment settings and help users understand complex interaction patterns. In this study, we analyzed agents with similar behaviors and selected scenarios to understand the interactions of the agents, which made it easier to understand the strategies of agents in MARL.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define language models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench features high-quality human annotations that require integrated understanding across all modalities. Our evaluation reveals that: i) open-source OLMs show significant limitations in instruction-following and reasoning in tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baseline models perform poorly (around 50% accuracy) even with textual alternatives to image/audio inputs. To address these limitations, we develop OmniInstruct, an 96K-sample instruction tuning dataset for training OLMs. We advocate for developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance.

However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally to this work.

Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.</p></details> | preprint | None |

The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation.

We introduce Physical AI Bench (PAI-Bench), a unified and comprehensive benchmark that evaluates perception and prediction capabilities across video generation, conditional video generation, and video understanding, comprising 2,808 real-world cases with task-aligned metrics designed to capture physical plausibility and domain-specific reasoning. Our study provides a systematic assessment of recent models and shows that video generative models, despite strong visual fidelity, often struggle to maintain physically coherent dynamics, while multi-modal large language models exhibit limited performance in forecasting and causal interpretation. These observations suggest that current systems are still at an early stage in handling the perceptual and predictive demands of Physical AI. In summary, PAI-Bench establishes a realistic foundation for evaluating Physical AI and highlights key gaps that future systems must address.</p></details> |  | None |

Instead of direct prediction the model progressively reflects and adjusts its hypotheses leading to more accurate and interpretable localization. Our approach achieves 68.4 accuracy on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark an improvement of 4.8 points. To measure real world generalization we introduce TPanel UI a dataset of 420 labeled industrial control panels with visual distortions such as blur and masking. On TPanel UI Chain of Ground improves over the strong baseline Qwen3 VL 235B by 6.9 points showing the effectiveness of multi step training free grounding across real world and digital interfaces. These results highlight a direction for unlocking grounding potential through structured iterative refinement instead of additional training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SGDiff: Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model for Image Collaborative SegCaptioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01975v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable image semantic understanding tasks, such as captioning or segmentation, necessitate users to input a prompt (e.g., text or bounding boxes) to predict a unique outcome, presenting challenges such as high-cost prompt input or limited information output. This paper introduces a new task ``Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning'' (SegCaptioning), which aims to translate a straightforward prompt, like a bounding box around an object, into diverse semantic interpretations represented by (caption, masks) pairs, allowing flexible result selection by users. This task poses significant challenges, including accurately capturing a user's intention from a minimal prompt while simultaneously predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. Technically, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. Initially, we introduce a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor to map a user's prompt to a scene graph, effectively capturing his intention. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer to predict correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss to explicitly align visual and textual entities by considering inter-modal similarity, resulting in well-aligned caption-mask pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, yielding promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI-2025 | None |

Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://streamgaze.github.io/</p></details> | None |

While supervised CIR methods achieve high accuracy, their reliance on costly triplet annotations motivates zero-shot solutions. The core challenge in zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) stems from a fundamental dilemma: existing text-centric or diffusion-based approaches struggle to effectively bridge the vision-language modality gap. To address this, we propose Fusion-Diff, a novel generative editing framework with high effectiveness and data efficiency designed for multimodal alignment. First, it introduces a multimodal fusion feature editing strategy within a joint vision-language (VL) space, substantially narrowing the modality gap. Second, to maximize data efficiency, the framework incorporates a lightweight Control-Adapter, enabling state-of-the-art performance through fine-tuning on only a limited-scale synthetic dataset of 200K samples. Extensive experiments on standard CIR benchmarks (CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO) demonstrate that Fusion-Diff significantly outperforms prior zero-shot approaches. We further enhance the interpretability of our model by visualizing the fused multimodal representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[QuantumCanvas: A Multimodal Benchmark for Visual Learning of Atomic Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01519v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

However, manual grading is subjective and inefficient, while existing deep learning solutions often lack clinical explainability or suffer from accumulated errors in segmentation area estimation. To address these issues, this study proposes AttnRegDeepLab (Attention-Guided Regression DeepLab), a framework characterized by dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL). A vanilla DeepLabV3+ decoder is modified by integrating Attention Gates into its skip connections, explicitly suppressing cytoplasmic noise to preserve contour details. Furthermore, a Multi-Scale Regression Head is introduced with a Feature Injection mechanism to propagate global grading priors into the segmentation task, rectifying systematic quantification errors. A 2-stage decoupled training strategy is proposed to address the gradient conflict in MTL. Also, a range-based loss is designed to leverage weakly labeled data. Our method achieves robust grading precision while maintaining excellent segmentation accuracy (Dice coefficient =0.729), in contrast to the end-to-end counterpart that might minimize grading error at the expense of contour integrity. This work provides a clinically interpretable solution that balances visual fidelity and quantitative precision.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |

It fits ANOVA-style main and pairwise interaction effects to a model's prediction surface. ORACLE treats a trained network as a black-box response, learns an orthogonal factorial surrogate on a discretized input grid, and uses simple centering and $μ$-rebalancing steps to obtain main- and interaction-effect tables that remain $L^2$-consistent with the original model. The resulting grid-based interaction maps are easy to visualize, comparable across backbones, and directly connected to classical design-of-experiments analyses. On synthetic factorial and low- to medium-dimensional tabular regression benchmarks, ORACLE more accurately recovers ground-truth ANOVA interactions and hotspot structure than Monte Carlo SHAP-family interaction methods, as measured by ranking, localization, and cross-backbone stability metrics. In latent image and text settings, ORACLE instead delineates its natural scope, and our results indicate that grid-based ANOVA surrogates are most effective when features admit interpretable factorial structure, making ORACLE particularly well-suited to scientific and engineering tabular workflows that require stable, DoE-style interaction summaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: v2; major revision; removed experiments from v1; results updated; author list updated accordingly. 30 pages, 3 figures</p></details> | None |

Despite the availability of real and synthetic datasets, existing AI models that achieve high accuracy often over-rely on seafloor features, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates two key modules: (i) a Targeted Contrastive Unlearning (TCU) module, which extends the traditional triplet loss to reduce seafloor-induced background bias and improve generalization, and (ii) the Unlearn to Explain Sonar Framework (UESF), which provides visual insights into what the model has deliberately forgotten while adapting the LIME explainer to generate more faithful and localized attributions for unlearning evaluation. Extensive experiments across both real and synthetic sonar datasets validate our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in unlearning effectiveness, model robustness, and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVIP 2025</p></details> | None |

Current detection methodologies in this domain often overlook the crucial aspect of localized information, despite the fact that manipulations frequently occur in specific areas, particularly in facial regions. In response to this critical observation, we propose the M4-BLIP framework. This innovative framework utilizes the BLIP-2 model, renowned for its ability to extract local features, as the cornerstone for feature extraction. Complementing this, we incorporate local facial information as prior knowledge. A specially designed alignment and fusion module within M4-BLIP meticulously integrates these local and global features, creating a harmonious blend that enhances detection accuracy. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly integrates with Large Language Models (LLM), significantly improving the interpretability of the detection outcomes. Extensive quantitative and visualization experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework against the state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |

Traditional manual annotation is prohibitively expensive and non-scalable, while existing synthetic methods often suffer from stochastic hallucinations and a lack of logical interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{\PipelineName}, a novel neuro-symbolic data engineering framework that formalizes benchmark synthesis as a deterministic graph traversal process. Unlike black-box generative approaches, Med-CRAFT extracts structured visual primitives (e.g., surgical instruments, anatomical boundaries) from raw video streams and instantiates them into a dynamic Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph. By anchoring query generation to valid paths within this graph, we enforce a rigorous Chain-of-Thought (CoT) provenance for every synthesized benchmark item. We instantiate this pipeline to produce M3-Med-Auto, a large-scale medical video reasoning benchmark exhibiting fine-grained temporal selectivity and multi-hop logical complexity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our automated pipeline generates query workloads with complexity comparable to expert-curated datasets. Furthermore, a logic alignment analysis reveals a high correlation between the prescribed graph topology and the reasoning steps of state-of-the-art MLLMs, validating the system's capability to encode verifiable logic into visual-linguistic benchmarks. This work paves the way for scalable, low-cost construction of robust evaluation protocols in critical domains.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

Conventional reconstruction techniques prioritize pixel-level recovery and may produce visually plausible outputs while compromising anatomical fidelity, an issue that can directly impact clinical outcomes. We propose a semantic-aware medical image reconstruction framework that integrates high-level latent embeddings with a hybrid U-Net architecture to preserve clinically relevant structures during restoration. To ensure trust and accountability, we incorporate a lightweight blockchain-based provenance layer using scale-free graph design, enabling verifiable recording of each reconstruction event without imposing significant overhead. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and corruption types demonstrates improved structural consistency, restoration accuracy, and provenance integrity compared with existing approaches. By uniting semantic-guided reconstruction with secure traceability, our solution advances dependable AI for medical imaging, enhancing both diagnostic confidence and regulatory compliance in healthcare environments.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground-truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for evaluating brain visual decoding methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Oral).

The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

However, adapting these models to new datasets or domains is computationally costly, especially in low-resource or few-shot settings, and existing prompt-learning methods often lack interpretability. We introduce Efficient Prompt Learning with Knowledge Graph (EPLKG), which uses a knowledge graph to curate diverse, interpretable prompts and, where KG coverage is limited, augments this bank with LLM-generated human-readable visual descriptions. EPLKG operates entirely on cached CLIP image and text embeddings and employs a lightweight Gumbel-Softmax module to select a single prompt per image-class pair, enabling low-memory, fast training. Across 11 benchmarks, EPLKG reduces per-image training time by up to 45 percent and peak GPU memory by around 30 to 40 percent compared to strong prompt-learning baselines, while keeping the average base-new harmonic-mean accuracy within 2 percentage points, thereby improving the efficiency of model adaptation without sacrificing competitive performance or interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current VQA benchmarks overlook scenarios with visually embedded questions, whereas advanced agents should be able to see the question without separate text input as humans. We introduce Visual-only Question Answering (VoQA), where both the scene and the question appear within a single image, requiring models to perceive and reason purely through vision. This setting supports more realistic visual understanding and interaction in scenarios where questions or instructions are embedded directly in the visual scene. Evaluations under pure visual-only zero-shot, prompt-guided and OCR-assisted settings show that current models exhibit a clear performance drop compared to traditional VQA. To address this, we investigate question-alignment fine-tuning strategies designed to guide models toward interpreting the visual question prior to reasoning. Leveraging VoQA dataset together with these strategies yields robust vision-only reasoning while preserving cross-task generalization to traditional VQA, reflecting the complementary visual and textual reasoning capabilities fostered through VoQA training. The code and data are publicly available.</p></details> | 21 pages | None |

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled high-quality SVG generation by framing the problem as a code generation task and leveraging large-scale pretraining. VLMs are particularly suitable for this task as they capture both global semantics and fine-grained visual patterns, while transferring knowledge across vision, natural language, and code domains. However, existing VLM approaches often struggle to produce faithful and efficient SVGs because they never observe the rendered images during training. Although differentiable rendering for autoregressive SVG code generation remains unavailable, rendered outputs can still be compared to original inputs, enabling evaluative feedback suitable for reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce RLRF (Reinforcement Learning from Rendering Feedback), an RL method that enhances SVG generation in autoregressive VLMs by leveraging feedback from rendered SVG outputs. Given an input image, the model generates SVG roll-outs that are rendered and compared to the original image to compute a reward. This visual fidelity feedback guides the model toward producing more accurate, efficient, and semantically coherent SVGs. RLRF significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning, addressing common failure modes and enabling precise, high-quality SVG generation with strong structural understanding and generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, real-world harmful content is often camouflaged, relying on nuanced text-image interplay, such as memes or images with embedded malicious text, to evade detection. This raises a key question: \textbf{can LVLMs perceive such camouflaged harmful content as sensitively as humans do?} In this paper, we introduce CamHarmTI, a benchmark for evaluating LVLM ability to perceive and interpret camouflaged harmful content within text-image compositions. CamHarmTI consists of over 4,500 samples across three types of image-text posts. Experiments on 100 human users and 12 mainstream LVLMs reveal a clear perceptual gap: humans easily recognize such content (e.g., over 95.75\% accuracy), whereas current LVLMs often fail (e.g., ChatGPT-4o achieves only 2.10\% accuracy). Moreover, fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that \bench serves as an effective resource for improving model perception, increasing accuracy by 55.94\% for Qwen2.5VL-7B. Attention analysis and layer-wise probing further reveal that fine-tuning enhances sensitivity primarily in the early layers of the vision encoder, promoting a more integrated scene understanding. These findings highlight the inherent perceptual limitations in LVLMs and offer insight into more human-aligned visual reasoning systems.</p></details> |  | None |

In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.</p></details> |  | None |

A comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then, generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios. Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios, while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Fi...</summary><p>10 Figures; 6 Tables; Accepted, IEEE ACCESS 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite its cultural and societal significance, satire comprehension, particularly in purely visual forms, remains a challenging task for current vision-language models. This task requires not only detecting satire but also deciphering its nuanced meaning and identifying the implicated entities. Existing models often fail to effectively integrate local entity relationships with global context, leading to misinterpretation, comprehension biases, and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose SatireDecoder, a training-free framework designed to enhance satirical image comprehension. Our approach proposes a multi-agent system performing visual cascaded decoupling to decompose images into fine-grained local and global semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy guided by uncertainty analysis, which breaks down the complex satire comprehension process into sequential subtasks with minimized uncertainty. Our method significantly improves interpretive accuracy while reducing hallucinations. Experimental results validate that SatireDecoder outperforms existing baselines in comprehending visual satire, offering a promising direction for vision-language reasoning in nuanced, high-level semantic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Prior work has used generative models to replicate known category selectivity in isolated regions (e.g., faces in FFA), but these approaches offer limited insight into how regions interact during complex, naturalistic vision. We introduce NeuroVolve, a generative framework that provides brain-guided image synthesis via optimization of a neural objective function in the embedding space of a pretrained vision-language model. Images are generated under the guidance of a programmable neural objective, i.e., activating or deactivating single regions or multiple regions together. NeuroVolve is validated by recovering known selectivity for individual brain regions, while expanding to synthesize coherent scenes that satisfy complex, multi-region constraints. By tracking optimization steps, it reveals semantic trajectories through embedding space, unifying brain-guided image editing and preferred stimulus generation in a single process. We show that NeuroVolve can generate both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli for single ROIs, as well as stimuli aligned to curated neural objectives. These include co-activation and decorrelation between regions, exposing cooperative and antagonistic tuning relationships. Notably, the framework captures subject-specific preferences, supporting personalized brain-driven synthesis and offering interpretable constraints for mapping, analyzing, and probing neural representations of visual information.</p></details> |  | None |

We identify two key limitations in these approaches: (i) they often suffer from instability, especially during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal convergence and degraded performance on clean data, and (ii) they exhibit a suboptimal trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy, hindering the simultaneous optimization of both objectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization, which offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as improving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing embedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data performance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that LORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal degradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in out-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image embeddings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Subspace Isolation: Many-to-Many Transformer for Light Field Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00740v4)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the foundational component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets, and it offers a favorable balance between model performance and efficiency, yielding higher-quality LFSR results with substantially lower demand for memory and computation. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> | None |
| **[Design and Evaluation of a Multi-Agent Perception System for Autonomous Flying Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00259v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Flying Networks (FNs) are emerging as a key enabler of on-demand connectivity in dynamic and infrastructure-limited environments. However, current approaches mainly focus on UAV placement, routing, and resource management, neglecting the autonomous perception of users and their service demands - a critical capability for zero-touch network operation. This paper presents the Multi-Agent Perception System (MAPS), a modular and scalable system that leverages multi-modal large language models (MM-LLMs) and agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) to interpret visual and audio data collected by UAVs and generate Service Level Specifications (SLSs) describing user count, spatial distribution, and traffic demand. MAPS is evaluated using a synthetic multimodal emergency dataset, achieving user detection accuracies above 70% and SLS generation under 130 seconds in 90% of cases. Results demonstrate that combining audio and visual modalities enhances user detection and show that MAPS provides the perception layer required for autonomous, zero-touch FNs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLIP-Free, Label-Free, Zero-Shot Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10981v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) map dense, high-dimensional feature representations into a set of human-interpretable concepts which are then combined linearly to make a prediction. However, modern CBMs rely on the CLIP model to establish a mapping from dense feature representations to textual concepts, and it remains unclear how to design CBMs for models other than CLIP. Methods that do not use CLIP instead require manual, labor intensive annotation to associate feature representations with concepts. Furthermore, all CBMs necessitate training a linear classifier to map the extracted concepts to class labels. In this work, we lift all three limitations simultaneously by proposing a method that converts any frozen visual classifier into a CBM without requiring image-concept labels (label-free), without relying on the CLIP model (CLIP-free), and by deriving the linear classifier in a zero-shot manner. Our method is formulated by aligning the original classifier's distribution (over discrete class indices) with its corresponding vision-language counterpart distribution derived from textual class names, while preserving the classifier's performance. The approach requires no ground-truth image-class annotations, and is highly data-efficient and preserves the classifier's reasoning process. Applied and tested on over 40 visual classifiers, our resulting CLIP-free, zero-shot CBM sets a new state of the art, surpassing even supervised CLIP-based CBMs. Finally, we also show that our method can be used for zero-shot image captioning, outperforming existing methods based on CLIP, and achieving state of the art results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TIE: A Training-Inversion-Exclusion Framework for Visually Interpretable and Uncertainty-Guided Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00229v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks often struggle to recognize when an input lies outside their training experience, leading to unreliable and overconfident predictions. Building dependable machine learning systems therefore requires methods that can both estimate predictive \textit{uncertainty} and detect \textit{out-of-distribution (OOD)} samples in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TIE: a Training--Inversion--Exclusion} framework for visually interpretable and uncertainty-guided anomaly detection that jointly addresses these challenges through iterative refinement. TIE extends a standard $n$-class classifier to an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class initialized with Gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. Within each epoch, TIE performs a closed-loop process of \textit{training, inversion, and exclusion}, where highly uncertain inverted samples reconstructed from the just-trained classifier are excluded into the garbage class. Over successive iterations, the inverted samples transition from noisy artifacts into visually coherent class prototypes, providing transparent insight into how the model organizes its learned manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs by either directly mapping them to the garbage class or producing low-confidence, uncertain misclassifications within the in-distribution classes that are easily separable, all without relying on external OOD datasets. A comprehensive threshold-based evaluation using multiple OOD metrics and performance measures such as \textit{AUROC}, \textit{AUPR}, and \textit{FPR@95\%TPR} demonstrates that TIE offers a unified and interpretable framework for robust anomaly detection and calibrated uncertainty estimation (UE) achieving near-perfect OOD detection with \textbf{\(\!\approx\!\) 0 FPR@95\%TPR} when trained on MNIST or FashionMNIST and tested against diverse unseen datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce Mammo-FM, the first foundation model specifically for mammography, pretrained on the largest and most diverse dataset to date - 140,677 patients (821,326 mammograms) across four U.S. institutions. Mammo-FM provides a unified foundation for core clinical tasks in breast imaging, including cancer diagnosis, pathology localization, structured report generation, and cancer risk prognosis within a single framework. Its alignment between images and text enables both visual and textual interpretability, improving transparency and clinical auditability, which are essential for real-world adoption. We rigorously evaluate Mammo-FM across diagnosis, prognosis, and report-generation tasks in in- and out-of-distribution datasets. Despite operating on native-resolution mammograms and using only one-third of the parameters of state-of-the-art generalist FMs, Mammo-FM consistently outperforms them across multiple public and private benchmarks. These results highlight the efficiency and value of domain-specific foundation models designed around the full spectrum of tasks within a clinical domain and emphasize the importance of rigorous, domain-aligned evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AutocleanEEG ICVision: Automated ICA Artifact Classification Using Vision-Language AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00194v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce EEG Autoclean Vision Language AI (ICVision) a first-of-its-kind system that emulates expert-level EEG ICA component classification through AI-agent vision and natural language reasoning. Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 figures | None |

This report introduces the latest generation of the Gemini Robotics model family: Gemini Robotics 1.5, a multi-embodiment Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a state-of-the-art Embodied Reasoning (ER) model. We are bringing together three major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel architecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn from heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general. Second, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal reasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to "think before acting" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex, multi-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the user. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for embodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for robots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. Together, this family of models takes us a step towards an era of physical agents-enabling robots to perceive, think and then act so they can solve complex multi-step tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Analysis of Incursive Breast Cancer in Mammograms Using YOLO, Explainability, and Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00129v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for breast cancer detection from mammographic images have significant reliability problems when presented with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs such as other imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray) or equipment variations, leading to unreliable detection and misdiagnosis. The current research mitigates the fundamental OOD issue through a comprehensive approach integrating ResNet50-based OOD filtering with YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12) for accurate detection of breast cancer. Our strategy establishes an in-domain gallery via cosine similarity to rigidly reject non-mammographic inputs prior to processing, ensuring that only domain-associated images supply the detection pipeline. The OOD detection component achieves 99.77\% general accuracy with immaculate 100\% accuracy on OOD test sets, effectively eliminating irrelevant imaging modalities. ResNet50 was selected as the optimum backbone after 12 CNN architecture searches. The joint framework unites OOD robustness with high detection performance (mAP@0.5: 0.947) and enhanced interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations. Experimental validation establishes that OOD filtering significantly improves system reliability by preventing false alarms on out-of-distribution inputs while maintaining higher detection accuracy on mammographic data. The present study offers a fundamental foundation for the deployment of reliable AI-based breast cancer detection systems in diverse clinical environments with inherent data heterogeneity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Video-R2: Reinforcing Consistent and Grounded Reasoning in Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23478v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video-R2 Technical Report</p></details> | None |
| **[Video-CoM: Interactive Video Reasoning via Chain of Manipulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23477v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced video understanding, yet most still "think about videos" ie once a video is encoded, reasoning unfolds entirely in text, treating visual input as a static context. This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability.

Leveraging the Hampton University Skyler Radar Sensor dataset, we simulate drift, ghost, and mirror-type spoofing attacks and evaluate tracker performance using both Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) and Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) architectures. Our framework separates clean and spoofed detection streams, visualizes spoof-induced trajectory divergence, and quantifies assignment errors via direct drift-from-truth metrics. Clustering overlays, injection-aware timelines, and scenario-adaptive visualizations enable interpretability across spoof types and configurations. Evaluation figures and logs are auto-exported for reproducible comparison. SpoofTrackBench sets a new standard for open, ethical benchmarking of spoof-aware tracking pipelines, enabling rigorous cross-architecture analysis and community validation.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional analysis methods often struggle with these issues, motivating the need for more robust, data-driven approaches. This dissertation explores deep learning methodologies to improve the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, focusing on dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation. First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings. Next, we present FLINT, a deep learning model for high-quality flow estimation and temporal interpolation in both flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised settings. FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data. This parameter-aware adaptation yields more accurate reconstructions across diverse scientific domains, even with sparse or incomplete data. Overall, this dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization, providing scalable, adaptable, and high-quality solutions for interpreting complex spatio-temporal ensembles.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, University of Groningen, 2025</p></details> | None |

Author intent understanding plays a crucial role in interpreting social media content. This paper addresses author intent classification in Bangla social media posts by leveraging both textual and visual data. Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification. Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning. This research establishes new benchmarks and methodological standards for Bangla and other low-resource languages.

Existing approaches lack explainability and cross-domain generalization capabilities crucial for practical deployment. We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.</p></details> |  | None |

While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together, LIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.</p></details> | under review | None |

To rigorously study this, we introduce MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks that probe a model's reliance on specific modalities. Using black-box and white-box interpretability techniques, we provide a critical analysis of the brittleness of both open- and closed-sourced MLLMs. We show that current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, thereby lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding. This work provides both interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning.

However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

| **[Mechanistic Finetuning of Vision-Language-Action Models via Few-Shot Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22697v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Action (VLAs) models promise to extend the remarkable success of vision-language models (VLMs) to robotics. Yet, unlike VLMs in the vision-language domain, VLAs for robotics require finetuning to contend with varying physical factors like robot embodiment, environment characteristics, and spatial relationships of each task. Existing fine-tuning methods lack specificity, adapting the same set of parameters regardless of a task's visual, linguistic, and physical characteristics. Inspired by functional specificity in neuroscience, we hypothesize that it is more effective to finetune sparse model representations specific to a given task. In this work, we introduce Robotic Steering, a finetuning approach grounded in mechanistic interpretability that leverages few-shot demonstrations to identify and selectively finetune task-specific attention heads aligned with the physical, visual, and linguistic requirements of robotic tasks. Through comprehensive on-robot evaluations with a Franka Emika robot arm, we demonstrate that Robotic Steering outperforms LoRA while achieving superior robustness under task variation, reduced computational cost, and enhanced interpretability for adapting VLAs to diverse robotic tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we extend the application of SAEs to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, and introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating monosemanticity at the neuron-level in visual representations. To ensure that our evaluation aligns with human perception, we propose a benchmark derived from a large-scale user study. Our experimental results reveal that SAEs trained on VLMs significantly enhance the monosemanticity of individual neurons, with sparsity and wide latents being the most influential factors. Further, we demonstrate that applying SAE interventions on CLIP's vision encoder directly steers multimodal LLM outputs (e.g., LLaVA), without any modifications to the underlying language model. These findings emphasize the practicality and efficacy of SAEs as an unsupervised tool for enhancing both interpretability and control of VLMs. Code and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/sae-for-vlm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ExplainableML/sae-for-vlm) |

However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Experiments on three diverse video datasets - EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition) with multiple target models covering both classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that LD-ViCE generalizes well and achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, LD-ViCE achieves significantly higher regression accuracy than prior methods and exhibits high temporal consistency, while the refinement stage further improves perceptual quality. Qualitative analyses confirm that LD-ViCE produces semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, providing actionable insights into model behavior. LD-ViCE advances the trustworthiness and interpretability of video-based AI systems through visually coherent counterfactual explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review CVPR 2026 (44 Pages)</p></details> | None |
| **[Rethinking Cross-Generator Image Forgery Detection through DINOv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22471v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As generative models become increasingly diverse and powerful, cross-generator detection has emerged as a new challenge. Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets. Our study provides empirical evidence and a feasible hypothesis for understanding why foundation models generalize across diverse generators, offering a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[INSIGHT: An Interpretable Neural Vision-Language Framework for Reasoning of Generative Artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22351v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing realism of AI-generated images produced by recent GAN and diffusion models has intensified concerns over the reliability of visual media. Yet, despite notable progress in deepfake detection, current forensic systems degrade sharply under real-world conditions such as severe downsampling, compression, and cross-domain distribution shifts. Moreover, most detectors operate as opaque classifiers, offering little insight into why an image is flagged as synthetic, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings. We introduce INSIGHT (Interpretable Neural Semantic and Image-based Generative-forensic Hallucination Tracing), a unified multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16 - 64x64). INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without inducing misleading artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions indicative of generative patterns, and CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors. A vision-language model is then prompted using a structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol to produce consistent, fine-grained explanations, verified through a dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to minimize hallucinations and ensure factuality. Across diverse domains, including animals, vehicles, and abstract synthetic scenes, INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establish INSIGHT as a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification.</p></details> | 36 pages, 17 figures | None |

However, this tight coupling between virtual and real content makes AR vulnerable to cognitive attacks: manipulations that distort users' semantic understanding of the environment. Existing detection methods largely focus on visual inconsistencies at the pixel or image level, offering limited semantic reasoning or interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce CADAR, a neuro-symbolic framework for cognitive attack detection in AR that integrates neural and symbolic reasoning. CADAR fuses multimodal vision-language representations from pre-trained models into a perception graph that captures objects, relations, and temporal contextual salience. Building on this structure, a particle-filter-based statistical reasoning module infers anomalies in semantic dynamics to reveal cognitive attacks. This combination provides both the adaptability of modern vision-language models and the interpretability of probabilistic symbolic reasoning. Preliminary experiments on an AR cognitive-attack dataset demonstrate consistent advantages over existing approaches, highlighting the potential of neuro-symbolic methods for robust and interpretable AR security.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent methods automate concept generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they still face three fundamental challenges: poor visual grounding, concept redundancy, and the absence of principled metrics to balance predictive accuracy and concept compactness. We introduce PS-CBM, a Partially Shared CBM framework that addresses these limitations through three core components: (1) a multimodal concept generator that integrates LLM-derived semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) a Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA), a post-hoc metric that jointly captures both predictive accuracy and concept compactness. Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show that PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts. These results underscore PS-CBM's effectiveness in achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables, Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[TPCNet: Triple physical constraints for Low-light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22052v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light image enhancement is an essential computer vision task to improve image contrast and to decrease the effects of color bias and noise. Many existing interpretable deep-learning algorithms exploit the Retinex theory as the basis of model design. However, previous Retinex-based algorithms, that consider reflected objects as ideal Lambertian ignore specular reflection in the modeling process and construct the physical constraints in image space, limiting generalization of the model. To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MedEyes: Learning Dynamic Visual Focus for Medical Progressive Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22018v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate medical diagnosis often involves progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning, characteristics commonly observed in clinical workflows. While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods typically rely on a single modality, such as text, image, or network, and are limited to predicting one or two demographic attributes, constraining their generalizability and robustness across populations. This study leverages GPT-5, a state-of-the-art multimodal foundation model, to infer age, gender, and race from social media profiles. Using a dataset of 263 publicly available X (formerly Twitter) users, we design a progressive multimodal framework that incrementally incorporates usernames, profile descriptions, tweets, and profile images to examine how each information source contributes to inference accuracy. Results show a consistent improvement across all conditions, with the inclusion of textual and visual cues substantially enhancing performance. GPT-5 achieves an overall accuracy of 0.90 for age, 0.98 for gender, and 0.85 for race, outperforming existing models under equivalent inputs. These findings demonstrate the potential of large multimodal foundation models to capture complex, cross-modal demographic cues with minimal task-specific training. The study further highlights a transparent, interpretable approach to multimodal reasoning that advances the accuracy, fairness, and scalability of demographic inference in social data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures and 4 tables</p></details> | None |

We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.</p></details> | To appear at AAAI-26 | None |

In a SemImage, each word is represented as a pixel in a 2D image: rows correspond to sentences and an additional boundary row is inserted between sentences to mark semantic transitions. Each pixel is not a typical RGB value but a vector in a disentangled HSV color space, encoding different linguistic features: the Hue with two components H_cos and H_sin to account for circularity encodes the topic, Saturation encodes the sentiment, and Value encodes intensity or certainty. We enforce this disentanglement via a multi-task learning framework: a ColorMapper network maps each word embedding to the HSV space, and auxiliary supervision is applied to the Hue and Saturation channels to predict topic and sentiment labels, alongside the main task objective. The insertion of dynamically computed boundary rows between sentences yields sharp visual boundaries in the image when consecutive sentences are semantically dissimilar, effectively making paragraph breaks salient. We integrate SemImage with standard 2D CNNs (e.g., ResNet) for document classification. Experiments on multi-label datasets (with both topic and sentiment annotations) and single-label benchmarks demonstrate that SemImage can achieve competitive or better accuracy than strong text classification baselines (including BERT and hierarchical attention networks) while offering enhanced interpretability. An ablation study confirms the importance of the multi-channel HSV representation and the dynamic boundary rows. Finally, we present visualizations of SemImage that qualitatively reveal clear patterns corresponding to topic shifts and sentiment changes in the generated image, suggesting that our representation makes these linguistic features visible to both humans and machines.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the study confronts common endoscopic challenges such as variable lighting, fluctuating camera angles, and frequent imaging artifacts. The best performing models, VGG16 and MobileNetV2, each achieved a test accuracy of 96.5%, while Xception reached 94.24%, establishing robust benchmarks and baselines for automated disease classification. In addition to strong classification performance, the approach includes explainable AI via Grad-CAM visualization, enabling identification of image regions most influential to model predictions and enhancing clinical interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate the potential for robust, accurate, and interpretable medical image analysis even in complex real-world conditions. This work contributes original benchmarks, comparative insights, and visual explanations, advancing the landscape of gastrointestinal computer-aided diagnosis and underscoring the importance of diverse, clinically relevant datasets and model explainability in medical AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

Although these models perform strongly on natural images, their behavior on medical data remains insufficiently characterized. While SAM 2 is widely used for annotation in 3D medical workflows, SAM 3 introduces a new perception backbone, detector-tracker pipeline, and concept-level prompting that may alter its behavior under spatial prompts. We present the first controlled comparison of SAM 2 and SAM 3 for zero-shot segmentation of 3D medical volumes and videos under purely visual prompting, with concept mechanisms disabled. We assess whether SAM 3 can serve as an out-of-the-box replacement for SAM 2 without customization. We benchmark both models on 16 public datasets (CT, MRI, 3D and cine ultrasound, endoscopy) covering 54 anatomical structures, pathologies, and surgical instruments. Prompts are restricted to the first frame and use four modes: single-click, multi-click, bounding box, and dense mask. This design standardizes preprocessing, prompt placement, propagation rules, and metric computation to disentangle prompt interpretation from propagation. Prompt-frame analysis shows that SAM 3 provides substantially stronger initialization than SAM 2 for click prompting across most structures. In full-volume analysis, SAM 3 retains this advantage for complex, vascular, and soft-tissue anatomies, emerging as the more versatile general-purpose segmenter. While SAM 2 remains competitive for compact, rigid organs under strong spatial guidance, it frequently fails on challenging targets where SAM 3 succeeds. Overall, our results suggest that SAM 3 is the superior default choice for most medical segmentation tasks, particularly those involving sparse user interaction or complex anatomical topology.</p></details> |  | None |

While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed "PathReasoning", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages; webpage: https://snap-research.github.io/canvas-to-image/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://snap-research.github.io/canvas-to-image) |

In this work, we extract, process, and visualize latent state geometries in Transformer-based language models through dimensionality reduction. We capture layerwise activations at multiple points within Transformer blocks and enable systematic analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP). We demonstrate experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMa models, where we uncover interesting geometric patterns in latent space. Notably, we identify a clear separation between attention and MLP component outputs across intermediate layers, a pattern not documented in prior work to our knowledge. We also characterize the high norm of latent states at the initial sequence position and visualize the layerwise evolution of latent states. Additionally, we demonstrate the high-dimensional helical structure of GPT-2's positional embeddings, the sequence-wise geometric patterns in LLaMa, and experiment with repeating token sequences. We aim to support systematic analysis of Transformer internals with the goal of enabling further reproducible interpretability research.

Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.</p></details> |  | None |

However, when directly applying ProtoPNet on vision transformer (ViT) backbones, learned prototypes have a "distraction" problem: they have a relatively high probability of being activated by the background and pay less attention to the foreground. The powerful capability of modeling long-term dependency makes the transformer-based ProtoPNet hard to focus on prototypical parts, thus severely impairing its inherent interpretability. This paper proposes prototypical part transformer (ProtoPFormer) for appropriately and effectively applying the prototype-based method with ViTs for interpretable image recognition. The proposed method introduces global and local prototypes for capturing and highlighting the representative holistic and partial features of targets according to the architectural characteristics of ViTs. The global prototypes are adopted to provide the global view of objects to guide local prototypes to concentrate on the foreground while eliminating the influence of the background. Afterwards, local prototypes are explicitly supervised to concentrate on their respective prototypical visual parts, increasing the overall interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed global and local prototypes can mutually correct each other and jointly make final decisions, which faithfully and transparently reason the decision-making processes associatively from the whole and local perspectives, respectively. Moreover, ProtoPFormer consistently achieves superior performance and visualization results over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) prototype-based baselines.

Although recent advances in self-supervised learning and masked image modeling (MIM) have enabled SAR foundation models, these methods largely emphasize low-level visual features and often overlook multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition in SAR imagery. To address this, we construct SARVLM-1M, a large-scale vision-language dataset with over one million image-text pairs aggregated from existing datasets. We further propose a domain transfer training strategy to mitigate the large gap between natural and SAR imagery. Building on this, we develop SARVLM, the first vision language foundation model (VLM) tailored to SAR, comprising SARCLIP and SARCap. SARVLM is trained with a vision-language contrastive objective under the proposed domain transfer strategy, bridging SAR imagery and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments on image text retrieval, zero-shot classification, semantic localization, and imagery captioning demonstrate that SARVLM delivers superior feature extraction and interpretation, outperforming state-of-the-art VLMs and advancing SAR semantic understanding. Code and datasets will be released soon.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  | None |

This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[RubricRL: Simple Generalizable Rewards for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20651v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning text-to-image generative models with human preferences. A key challenge, however, lies in designing effective and interpretable rewards. Existing methods often rely on either composite metrics (e.g., CLIP, OCR, and realism scores) with fixed weights or a single scalar reward distilled from human preference models, which can limit interpretability and flexibility. We propose RubricRL, a simple and general framework for rubric-based reward design that offers greater interpretability, composability, and user control. Instead of using a black-box scalar signal, RubricRL dynamically constructs a structured rubric for each prompt--a decomposable checklist of fine-grained visual criteria such as object correctness, attribute accuracy, OCR fidelity, and realism--tailored to the input text. Each criterion is independently evaluated by a multimodal judge (e.g., o4-mini), and a prompt-adaptive weighting mechanism emphasizes the most relevant dimensions. This design not only produces interpretable and modular supervision signals for policy optimization (e.g., GRPO or PPO), but also enables users to directly adjust which aspects to reward or penalize. Experiments with an autoregressive text-to-image model demonstrate that RubricRL improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and generalizability, while offering a flexible and extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Why Reasoning Matters? A Survey of Advancements in Multimodal Reasoning (v1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03151v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is central to human intelligence, enabling structured problem-solving across diverse tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their reasoning abilities in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic domains. However, effectively extending these capabilities into multimodal contexts-where models must integrate both visual and textual inputs-continues to be a significant challenge. Multimodal reasoning introduces complexities, such as handling conflicting information across modalities, which require models to adopt advanced interpretative strategies. Addressing these challenges involves not only sophisticated algorithms but also robust methodologies for evaluating reasoning accuracy and coherence. This paper offers a concise yet insightful overview of reasoning techniques in both textual and multimodal LLMs. Through a thorough and up-to-date comparison, we clearly formulate core reasoning challenges and opportunities, highlighting practical methods for post-training optimization and test-time inference. Our work provides valuable insights and guidance, bridging theoretical frameworks and practical implementations, and sets clear directions for future research.</p></details> |  | None |

This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> | [Code Link](https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe) |

They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video. Both optimization processes are guided solely by the target classifier, ensuring the explanation is faithful. To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps. Extensive experiments on video datasets such as Shape-Moving (motion classification), MEAD (emotion classification), and NTU RGB+D (action classification) show that our BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar and realistic counterfactual videos that provide concrete insights into the classifier's decision-making mechanism.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, there has been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.

Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems.</p></details> |  | None |

We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance. Further analysis confirms that explicit visual guidance plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing evaluation benchmarks for MLLMs primarily focus on abstract video comprehension, lacking a detailed assessment of their ability to understand video compositions, the nuanced interpretation of how visual elements combine and interact within highly compiled video contexts. We introduce VidComposition, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the video composition understanding capabilities of MLLMs using carefully curated compiled videos and cinematic-level annotations. VidComposition includes 982 videos with 1706 multiple-choice questions, covering various compositional aspects such as camera movement, angle, shot size, narrative structure, character actions and emotions, etc. Our comprehensive evaluation of 33 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveals a significant performance gap between human and model capabilities.

However, existing methods often rely on opaque, high-dimensional embeddings, limiting interpretability and practical visualization. In this work, we introduce Topological Evolution Rate (TopER), a novel, low-dimensional embedding approach grounded in topological data analysis. TopER simplifies a key topological approach, Persistent Homology, by calculating the evolution rate of graph substructures, resulting in intuitive and interpretable visualizations of graph data. This approach not only enhances the exploration of graph datasets but also delivers competitive performance in graph clustering and classification tasks. Our TopER-based models achieve or surpass state-of-the-art results across molecular, biological, and social network datasets in tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization.</p></details> | 27 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, existing systems face challenges in multimodal information fusion, adaptive communication, and decision interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality. A semantic-driven collaboration mechanism further supports task decomposition and conflict-free coordination among heterogeneous devices. Finally, the InDec module enhances decision transparency through Grad-CAM visualization. Simulation results in post-earthquake rescue scenarios demonstrate that CC-EIN achieves 95.4% task completion rate and 95% transmission efficiency while maintaining strong semantic consistency and energy efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures.

Though reinforcement learning from human feedback offers promise for preference alignment, existing reward models for visual generation face limitations, including black-box scoring without interpretability and potentially resultant unexpected biases. We present VisionReward, a general framework for learning human visual preferences in both image and video generation. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical visual assessment framework to capture fine-grained human preferences, and leverages linear weighting to enable interpretable preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-dimensional consistent strategy when using VisionReward as a reward model during preference optimization for visual generation. Experiments show that VisionReward can significantly outperform existing image and video reward models on both machine metrics and human evaluation. Notably, VisionReward surpasses VideoScore by 17.2% in preference prediction accuracy, and text-to-video models with VisionReward achieve a 31.6% higher pairwise win rate compared to the same models using VideoScore.

Training such capable agents requires large-scale, high-quality mobile GUI data. However, existing mobile GUI datasets are limited in scale, data comprehensiveness, and fidelity. To overcome this, we utilize two mobile SoC clusters to provide over 200 native, high-fidelity mobile environments, along with a VLM-enhanced automatic application traversal framework for highly parallel, automated dataset collection with minimal human intervention. With this system, we propose MobileViews, a million-scale mobile GUI dataset comprising over 1.2 million unique screenshot-view hierarchy pairs from more than 30K modern Android applications. We assess the effectiveness of MobileViews by training four VLMs using the reinforcement learning-based GUI grounding task and evaluating them on two representative GUI grounding benchmarks. Results show that MobileViews significantly enhances grounding accuracy by up to 6.1%. Further analysis of data scale and quality underscores the critical role of large, high-quality datasets as reliable sources for training mobile GUI agents.

Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused, yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a multi-agent framework that couples clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning and encodes a radiologist-style workflow into a modular, auditable pipeline. In addition, we integrate grounding and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts, resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>ML4H'...</summary><p>ML4H'25; Work in progress</p></details> | None |

In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+ with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights. Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of 0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, when used directly for step-level exploration, VLMs often exhibit frontier oscillations, unstable back-and-forth movements caused by overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality. We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines. Overall, our method achieves better scene coverage under equal exploration budgets on both OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>webpa...</summary><p>webpage: https://noahfrahm.github.io/Prune-Then-Plan-project-page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://noahfrahm.github.io/Prune-Then-Plan-project-page) |

Multimodal neural networks have seen increasing use for identifying species to help automate this task, but they have two major drawbacks. First, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of their decision making process. Second, collecting genetic data is often expensive and requires invasive procedures, often necessitating researchers to capture or kill the target specimen. We address both of these problems by extending prototype networks (ProtoPNets), which are a popular and interpretable alternative to traditional neural networks, to the multimodal, cost-aware setting. We ensemble prototypes from each modality, using an associated weight to determine how much a given prediction relies on each modality. We further introduce methods to identify cases for which we do not need the expensive genetic information to make confident predictions. We demonstrate that our approach can intelligently allocate expensive genetic data for fine-grained distinctions while using abundant image data for clearer visual classifications and achieving comparable accuracy to models that consistently use both modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages. 16 figures. 10 tables</p></details> | None |

Although existing debugging frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes, repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases. To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.

We present Agint, an agentic graph compiler, interpreter, and runtime that incrementally and hierarchically converts natural-language instructions into typed, effect-aware code DAGs. Agint introduces explicit type floors (text to data to spec to code) grounded in semantic graph transformations and a hybrid LLM and function-based JIT runtime. This enables dynamic graph refinement, reproducible and optimizable execution, speculative evaluation, and interoperability with existing developer tools. Agint's typed graph bindings improve reliability and allow concurrent composition of concurrent codebases by construction, supporting accelerated development with smaller and faster models, lower latency, efficient context utilization, and higher throughput. Hierarchical compilation allows scalable graph edits, while the graph structure supports reproducibility and efficient parallel generation. Agint provides a composable unix-style toolchain: dagify (DAG compiler), dagent (hybrid JIT runtime), schemagin (schema generator), and datagin (data transformer) for realtime, low-latency code and dataflow creation. Human developers and coding agents refine graphs through the Agint CLI, while non-technical users use Agint Flow GUI for visual editing, conversational refinement, and debugging to promote prototype agentic workflows to production code. This continuous co-creation model allows teams to prototype quickly, refine seamlessly, and deploy reliably, bridging natural language, compiler methods, and developer tooling to enable a new generation of composable, team-centric coding agents at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, NeurIPS 2025: Deep Learning for Code in the Agentic Era</p></details> | None |

Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision. A subsequent answer selection module evaluates the generated responses and assigns the most coherent and contextually accurate answer, effectively improve the model performance. By integrating a custom information retrieval system, domain-specific prompting, and reasoning-guided answer selection, ThiFAN-VQA bridges the gap between zero-shot and supervised methods, combining flexibility with consistency. Experiments on FloodNet and RescueNet-VQA, UAV-based datasets from flood- and hurricane-affected regions, demonstrate that ThiFAN-VQA achieves superior accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability for real-world post-disaster damage assessment tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods typically rely on extensive task-specific annotations and fine-tuning, limiting their ability to generalize effectively to novel or out-of-distribution scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce GroundingAgent, a novel agentic visual grounding framework that operates without any task-specific fine-tuning. GroundingAgent employs a structured, iterative reasoning mechanism that integrates pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and large language models (LLMs) to progressively refine candidate regions through joint semantic and spatial analyses. Remarkably, GroundingAgent achieves an average zero-shot grounding accuracy of 65.1 % on widely-used benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg), entirely without fine-tuning. Furthermore, by substituting MLLM-generated captions with the original query texts, the accuracy at the selection stage alone reaches approximately 90 %, closely matching supervised performance and underscoring the critical role of LLM reasoning capabilities. GroundingAgent also offers strong interpretability, transparently illustrating each reasoning step and providing clear insights into its decision-making process.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |
| **[TouchFormer: A Robust Transformer-based Framework for Multimodal Material Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19509v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional vision-based material perception methods often experience substantial performance degradation under visually impaired conditions, thereby motivating the shift toward non-visual multimodal material perception. Despite this, existing approaches frequently perform naive fusion of multimodal inputs, overlooking key challenges such as modality-specific noise, missing modalities common in real-world scenarios, and the dynamically varying importance of each modality depending on the task. These limitations lead to suboptimal performance across several benchmark tasks. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal fusion framework, TouchFormer. Specifically, we employ a Modality-Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism and intra- and inter-modality attention mechanisms to adaptively integrate cross-modal features, enhancing model robustness. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Instance Embedding Regularization(CER) strategy, which significantly improves classification accuracy in fine-grained subcategory material recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing non-visual methods, the proposed TouchFormer framework achieves classification accuracy improvements of 2.48% and 6.83% on SSMC and USMC tasks, respectively. Furthermore, real-world robotic experiments validate TouchFormer's effectiveness in enabling robots to better perceive and interpret their environment, paving the way for its deployment in safety-critical applications such as emergency response and industrial automation. The code and datasets will be open-source, and the videos are available in the supplementary materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wakalsprojectpage.github.io/comt-website/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wakalsprojectpage.github.io/comt-website) |

In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations (NeurReps).

Evidence from Italian Clinical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19220v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Multimodal Representation Learning for Healthcare (MMRL4H), EurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings.</p></details> |  | None |

The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> | None |

Given its broad range of real-world applications, enhancing SLU for practical deployment is increasingly critical. Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence. Additionally, we propose an instructional template, LR-Instruct, which first predicts labels and then generates corresponding reasoning. This two-step approach helps mitigate the influence of reasoning bias on label prediction. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating visual information and highlight the promise of explicit reasoning in advancing SLU.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection. In the training stage, our approach transforms a single visual modality into three complementary features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models. These features are explicitly aligned through an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy, which models inter-modal relationships through affinity matrices and optimizes their consistency through contrastive learning. Subsequently, our cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL) strategy enhances feature robustness across compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, establishing a new benchmark for robust deepfake detection. Notably, our approach maintains high detection accuracy even when individual features degrade, while providing interpretable insights into feature relationships through explicit alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>24-pa...</summary><p>24-page manuscript accepted to IJCV</p></details> | None |

Neuro-symbolic methods promise to address this by inducing interpretable logical rules, though they exploit rigid, domain-specific perception modules. We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

The approach enhances MedDRA by adding a hidden medical knowledge layer (Safeterm) that captures semantic relationships between terms in a 2-D map. Using this layer, AE Preferred Terms can be regrouped automatically into similarity clusters, and their association to the trial disease may be quantified. The Safeterm map is available online and connected to aggregated AE incidence tables from ClinicalTrials.gov. For signal detection, we compute treatment-specific disproportionality metrics using shrinkage incidence ratios. Cluster-level EBGM values are then derived through precision-weighted aggregation. Two visual outputs support interpretation: a semantic map showing AE incidence and an expectedness-versus-disproportionality plot for rapid signal detection. Applied to three legacy trials, the automated method clearly recovers all expected safety signals. Overall, augmenting MedDRA with a medical knowledge layer improves clarity, efficiency, and accuracy in AE interpretation for clinical trials.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 tables, 5 figures</p></details> | None |

However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.</p></details> |  | None |

In pursuit of continuous gains, these approaches have evolved toward increasingly sophisticated architectures with multi-stage pipelines, specialized fusion modules, edge-guided learning, and elaborate attention mechanisms. However, this complexity paradoxically introduces feature redundancy and cross-component interference that obscure salient cues, ultimately reaching performance bottlenecks. In contrast, human vision achieves efficient salient object identification without such architectural complexity. This contrast raises a fundamental question: can we design a biologically grounded yet architecturally simple SOD framework that dispenses with most of this engineering complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing DualGazeNet, a biologically inspired pure Transformer framework that models the dual biological principles of robust representation learning and magnocellular-parvocellular dual-pathway processing with cortical attention modulation in the human visual system. Extensive experiments on five RGB SOD benchmarks show that DualGazeNet consistently surpasses 25 state-of-the-art CNN- and Transformer-based methods. On average, DualGazeNet achieves about 60\% higher inference speed and 53.4\% fewer FLOPs than four Transformer-based baselines of similar capacity (VST++, MDSAM, Sam2unet, and BiRefNet). Moreover, DualGazeNet exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving leading or highly competitive performance on camouflaged and underwater SOD benchmarks without relying on additional modalities.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

The dataset contains near 10000 videos, each annotated with a scalar mean opinion score (MOS) and fine-grained attribution labels along three core dimensions: visual quality, dynamic quality, and text-video alignment. These multi-aspect annotations enable both accurate quality assessment and interpretable reasoning behind the scores. To leverage this data, we propose a unified evaluation model that jointly performs quality scoring and attribution-based explanation. The model adopts the SlowFast framework to distinguish between fast frames and slow frames - slow frames are processed with high resolution while fast frames use low resolution, balancing evaluation accuracy and computational efficiency. For training, we use data formatted in Chain-of-Thought (COT) style and employ a multi-stage strategy: we first conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), then further enhance the model with Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and finally perform SFT again to improve model stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality prediction while also providing human-aligned, interpretable justifications. Our dataset and model establish a strong foundation for explainable evaluation in generative video research, contributing to the development of multimodal generation and trustworthy AI.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data, existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable solution for next event prediction in PBPM.</p></details> | 42 pages | None |

To this end, we propose Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance.

Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 4 main figures, 10 extended data figures</p></details> | None |

We present PhysGS, a Bayesian-inferred extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that estimates dense, per-point physical properties from visual cues and vision--language priors. We formulate property estimation as Bayesian inference over Gaussian splats, where material and property beliefs are iteratively refined as new observations arrive. PhysGS also models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, enabling uncertainty-aware object and scene interpretation. Across object-scale (ABO-500), indoor, and outdoor real-world datasets, PhysGS improves accuracy of the mass estimation by up to 22.8%, reduces Shore hardness error by up to 61.2%, and lowers kinetic friction error by up to 18.1% compared to deterministic baselines. Our results demonstrate that PhysGS unifies 3D reconstruction, uncertainty modeling, and physical reasoning in a single, spatially continuous framework for dense physical property estimation.

| **[End-to-End Visual Autonomous Parking via Control-Aided Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11090v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively provides policy-relevant details - especially in critical areas where fine control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches lack effective synergy between perception and control. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA) mechanism. We train such an attention module in a self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages attention to focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather than merely minimizing the training loss - a shift we demonstrate leads to a more robust and generalizable policy. To further strengthen the framework, CAA-Policy incorporates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task to improve temporal consistency of control outputs, a learnable motion prediction module to robustly track target slots over time, and a modified target tokenization scheme for more effective feature fusion. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that CAA-Policy consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. Code and Collected Training datasets will be released. Code is released at https://github.com/ai4ce/CAAPolicy.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ai4ce/CAAPolicy) |

In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[NSTR: Neural Spectral Transport Representation for Space-Varying Frequency Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18384v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, audio, and 3D scenes. However, existing INR frameworks -- including MLPs with Fourier features, SIREN, and multiresolution hash grids -- implicitly assume a \textit{global and stationary} spectral basis. This assumption is fundamentally misaligned with real-world signals whose frequency characteristics vary significantly across space, exhibiting local high-frequency textures, smooth regions, and frequency drift phenomena. We propose \textbf{Neural Spectral Transport Representation (NSTR)}, the first INR framework that \textbf{explicitly models a spatially varying local frequency field}. NSTR introduces a learnable \emph{frequency transport equation}, a PDE that governs how local spectral compositions evolve across space. Given a learnable local spectrum field $S(x)$ and a frequency transport network $F_θ$ enforcing $\nabla S(x) \approx F_θ(x, S(x))$, NSTR reconstructs signals by spatially modulating a compact set of global sinusoidal bases. This formulation enables strong local adaptivity and offers a new level of interpretability via visualizing frequency flows. Experiments on 2D image regression, audio reconstruction, and implicit 3D geometry show that NSTR achieves significantly better accuracy-parameter trade-offs than SIREN, Fourier-feature MLPs, and Instant-NGP. NSTR requires fewer global frequencies, converges faster, and naturally explains signal structure through spectral transport fields. We believe NSTR opens a new direction in INR research by introducing explicit modeling of space-varying spectrum.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its underlying mechanism in visual domains remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate Mamba's representational properties and make three primary contributions. First, we theoretically analyze Mamba's relationship to Softmax and Linear Attention, confirming that it can be viewed as a low-rank approximation of Softmax Attention and thereby bridging the representational gap between Softmax and Linear forms. Second, we introduce a novel binary segmentation metric for activation map evaluation, extending qualitative assessments to a quantitative measure that demonstrates Mamba's capacity to model long-range dependencies. Third, by leveraging DINO for self-supervised pretraining, we obtain clearer activation maps than those produced by standard supervised approaches, highlighting Mamba's potential for interpretability. Notably, our model also achieves a 78.5 percent linear probing accuracy on ImageNet, underscoring its strong performance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights for future investigations of Mamba-based vision architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

This limitation reduces their ability to interpret real or AI-generated content (AIGC) videos and to generate physically consistent content. We present an approach that addresses this gap by translating physical-world context cues into interpretable representations aligned with VLMs' perception, comprehension, and reasoning. We introduce MASS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 4,350 real-world and AIGC videos and 8,361 free-form video question-answering pairs focused on physics-related comprehension tasks, with detailed annotations including visual detections, sub-segment grounding, and full-sequence 3D motion tracking of entities. We further present MASS, a model-agnostic method that injects spatial-temporal signals into the VLM language space via depth-based 3D encoding and visual grounding, coupled with a motion tracker for object dynamics. To strengthen cross-modal alignment and reasoning, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments and ablations show that our refined VLMs outperform comparable and larger baselines, as well as prior state-of-the-art models, by 8.7% and 6.0%, achieving performance comparable to close-source SoTA VLMs such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on physics reasoning and comprehension. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Although current Vision Language Models (VLMs) reason over complex scenes with diverse objects, action performances, and scene dynamics, understanding and controlling their internal processes remains an open challenge. Motivated by recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generative models, this paper introduces a logits-to-video (L2V) task alongside a model-independent approach, TRANSPORTER, to generate videos that capture the underlying rules behind VLMs' predictions. Given the high-visual-fidelity produced by T2V models, TRANSPORTER learns an optimal transport coupling to VLM's high-semantic embedding spaces. In turn, logit scores define embedding directions for conditional video generation. TRANSPORTER generates videos that reflect caption changes over diverse object attributes, action adverbs, and scene context. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across VLMs demonstrate that L2V can provide a fidelity-rich, novel direction for model interpretability that has not been previously explored.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://alexandrosstergiou.github.io/TRANSPORTER</p></details> | [Code Link](https://alexandrosstergiou.github.io/TRANSPORTER) |

We bridge this gap by introducing (1) the Attention Broadcast Decoder (ABCD), a plug-and-play module for autoencoder-based latent dynamics learning that generates pixel-accurate attention maps localizing each latent dimension's contribution while filtering static backgrounds. (2) By coupling these attention maps to 2D oscillator networks, we enable direct on-image visualization of learned dynamics (masses, stiffness, and forces) without prior knowledge. We validate our approach on single- and double-segment SCRs, demonstrating that ABCD-based models significantly improve multi-step prediction accuracy: 5.7x error reduction for Koopman operators and 3.5x for oscillator networks on the two-segment robot. The learned oscillator network autonomously discovers a chain structure of oscillators. Unlike standard methods, ABCD models enable smooth latent space extrapolation beyond training data. This fully data-driven approach yields compact, physically interpretable models suitable for control applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Weakly-supervised Latent Models for Task-specific Visual-Language Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18319v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous inspection in hazardous environments requires AI agents that can interpret high-level goals and execute precise control. A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.</p></details> |  | None |

While histopathology represents the gold standard, its invasiveness limits feasibility. Conventional supervised deep learning approaches are constrained by scarce biopsy-confirmed training data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) overcomes this by leveraging the growing availability of large-scale unlabeled brain metastases imaging datasets. Methods: In a two-phase deep learning strategy inspired by the foundation model paradigm, a Vision Transformer (ViT) was pre-trained via SSL on 10,167 unlabeled multi-source T1CE MRI sub-volumes. The pre-trained ViT was then fine-tuned for RN classification using a two-channel input (T1CE MRI and segmentation masks) on the public MOLAB dataset (n=109) using 20% of datasets as same-center held-out test set. External validation was performed on a second-center test cohort (n=28). Results: The self-supervised model achieved an AUC of 0.916 on the same-center test set and 0.764 on the second center test set, surpassing the fully supervised ViT (AUC 0.624/0.496; p=0.001/0.008) and radiomics (AUC 0.807/0.691; p=0.005/0.014). Multimodal integration further improved performance (AUC 0.947/0.821; p=0.073/0.001). Attention map visualizations enabled interpretability showing the model focused on clinically relevant lesion subregions. Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training on increasingly available unlabeled brain metastases datasets substantially improves AI model performance. A two-phase multimodal deep learning strategy achieved high accuracy in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression using only routine T1CE MRI and standard clinical data, providing an interpretable, clinically accessible solution that warrants further validation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Shape of Sight: A Homological Framework for Unifying Visual Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04723v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual perception, the brain's construction of a stable world from sensory data, faces several long-standing, fundamental challenges. While often studied separately, these problems have resisted a single, unifying computational framework. In this perspective, we propose a homological framework for visual perception. We argue that the brain's latent representations are governed by their topological parity. This parity interpretation functionally separates homological structures into two distinct classes: 1) Even-dimensional homology ($H_{even}$) acts as static, integrative scaffolds. These structures bind context and content into ``wholes'' or ``what'', serving as the stable, resonant cavities for perceptual objects; 2) Odd-dimensional homology ($H_{odd}$) acts as dynamic, recurrent flows. These structures represent paths, transformations, and self-sustaining ``traces'' or ``where'' that navigate the perceptual landscape. This scaffold-and-flow model is supported by the ventral-dorsal pathway separation and provides a unified solution to three core problems in visual perception. Homological parity hypothesis recasts visual perception not as a linear computation, but as a dynamic interaction between stable, integrative structures and the recurrent, self-sustaining flows that run on them. This perspective offers a new mathematical foundation for linking neural dynamics to perception and cognition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ARIAL: An Agentic Framework for Document VQA with Precise Answer Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18192v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent works have focused on relatively complex architectures to achieve good reconstruction performance from EEG, less attention has been paid to the source of this information. We present a unified framework that not only enables image reconstruction from EEG using a simple linear decoder, but also isolates interpretable EEG feature maps that support visual perception. Unlike prior approaches that rely on deep, opaque models, our method leverages the inherent structure of CLIP embeddings to keep the mapping linear. We show that training a simple linear decoder from EEG to CLIP latent space, followed by a frozen pre-trained diffusion model, is sufficient to decode images with state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Beyond reconstruction, Perceptogram enables the visualization of presumptive electrode preference and EEG patterns, revealing interpretable EEG feature maps that correspond to distinct visual attributes, such as semantic class, texture, and hue. We thus use our framework, Perceptogram, to probe EEG signals at various levels of the visual information hierarchy.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released.</p></details> | 6 figures, 11 tables | None |

Existing approaches often rely on known CAD models or prior object geometries, restricting generalization to novel or unknown objects. Other methods directly regress grasp poses from RGB-D data without object priors, but the inherent noise in depth sensing and the lack of object understanding make grasp synthesis and evaluation more difficult. Superquadrics (SQ) offer a compact, interpretable shape representation that captures the physical and graspability understanding of objects. However, recovering them from limited viewpoints is challenging, as existing methods rely on multiple perspectives for near-complete point cloud reconstruction, limiting their effectiveness in bin-picking. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RGBSQGrasp}, a grasping framework that leverages superquadric shape primitives and foundation metric depth estimation models to infer grasp poses from a monocular RGB camera -- eliminating the need for depth sensors. Our framework integrates a universal, cross-platform dataset generation pipeline, a foundation model-based object point cloud estimation module, a global-local superquadric fitting network, and an SQ-guided grasp pose sampling module. By integrating these components, RGBSQGrasp reliably infers grasp poses through geometric reasoning, enhancing grasp stability and adaptability to unseen objects. Real-world robotic experiments demonstrate a 92% grasp success rate, highlighting the effectiveness of RGBSQGrasp in packed bin-picking environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, IROS2025 RGMCW Best Workshop Paper</p></details> | None |

However, existing VQualA LMMs typically focus on a single task and rely on full-parameter fine-tuning, which makes them prone to overfitting on specific modalities or task types, thereby limiting their generalization capacity and transferability. To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart. Overall, our work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward the foundation LMM for VQualA.</p></details> |  | None |

However, when applied to scientific video understanding and educating, a domain that demands external professional knowledge integration and rigorous step-wise reasoning, existing approaches often struggle. To bridge this gap, we propose SciEducator, the first iterative self-evolving multi-agent system for scientific video comprehension and education. Rooted in the classical Deming Cycle from management science, our design reformulates its Plan-Do-Study-Act philosophy into a self-evolving reasoning and feedback mechanism, which facilitates the interpretation of intricate scientific activities in videos. Moreover, SciEducator can produce multimodal educational content tailored to specific scientific processes, including textual instructions, visual guides, audio narrations, and interactive references. To support evaluation, we construct SciVBench, a benchmark consisting of 500 expert-verified and literature-grounded science QA pairs across five categories, covering physical, chemical, and everyday phenomena. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SciEducator substantially outperforms leading closed-source MLLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o) and state-of-the-art video agents on the benchmark, establishing a new paradigm for the community.</p></details> |  | None |

This opacity is consequential: seemingly innocuous prompts can trigger excessive sycophancy, toxicity, or other undesirable traits, degrading utility and raising safety concerns. To address this issue, we introduce an interface that enables neural transparency by exposing language model internals during chatbot design. Our approach extracts behavioral trait vectors (empathy, toxicity, sycophancy, etc.) by computing differences in neural activations between contrastive system prompts that elicit opposing behaviors. We predict chatbot behaviors by projecting the system prompt's final token activations onto these trait vectors, normalizing for cross-trait comparability, and visualizing results via an interactive sunburst diagram. To evaluate this approach, we conducted an online user study using Prolific to compare our neural transparency interface against a baseline chatbot interface without any form of transparency. Our analyses suggest that users systematically miscalibrated AI behavior: participants misjudged trait activations for eleven of fifteen analyzable traits, motivating the need for transparency tools in everyday human-AI interaction. While our interface did not change design iteration patterns, it significantly increased user trust and was enthusiastically received. Qualitative analysis revealed nuanced user experiences with the visualization, suggesting interface and interaction improvements for future work. This work offers a path for how mechanistic interpretability can be operationalized for non-technical users, establishing a foundation for safer, more aligned human-AI interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>SK an...</summary><p>SK and AB are co-first authors</p></details> | None |

Financial documents contain visually dense and table heavy layouts where numerical and temporal information is tightly coupled with structure. In high stakes settings, small OCR mistakes such as sign inversion or shifted dates can lead to materially different interpretations, while traditional OCR metrics like ROUGE and edit distance capture only surface level text similarity. \ficriticaled provides 500 image-HTML pairs with expert annotated financial facts covering over seven hundred numerical and temporal facts. It introduces three key contributions. First, it establishes the first fact level evaluation benchmark for financial document understanding, shifting evaluation from lexical overlap to domain critical factual correctness. Second, all annotations are created and verified by financial experts with strict quality control over signs, magnitudes, and temporal expressions. Third, we develop an LLM-as-Judge evaluation pipeline that performs structured fact extraction and contextual verification for visually complex financial documents. We benchmark OCR systems, open source vision language models, and proprietary models on FinCriticalED. Results show that although the strongest proprietary models achieve the highest factual accuracy, substantial errors remain in visually intricate numerical and temporal contexts. Through quantitative evaluation and expert case studies, FinCriticalED provides a rigorous foundation for advancing visual factual precision in financial and other precision critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Yueru...</summary><p>Yueru He, Xueqing Peng: These two authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> | None |
| **[Physically Interpretable World Models via Weakly Supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12870v5)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning predictive models from high-dimensional sensory observations is fundamental for cyber-physical systems, yet the latent representations learned by standard world models lack physical interpretability. This limits their reliability, generalizability, and applicability to safety-critical tasks. We introduce Physically Interpretable World Models (PIWM), a framework that aligns latent representations with real-world physical quantities and constrains their evolution through partially known physical dynamics. Physical interpretability in PIWM is defined by two complementary properties: (i) the learned latent state corresponds to meaningful physical variables, and (ii) its temporal evolution follows physically consistent dynamics. To achieve this without requiring ground-truth physical annotations, PIWM employs weak distribution-based supervision that captures state uncertainty naturally arising from real-world sensing pipelines. The architecture integrates a VQ-based visual encoder, a transformer-based physical encoder, and a learnable dynamics model grounded in known physical equations. Across three case studies (Cart Pole, Lunar Lander, and Donkey Car), PIWM achieves accurate long-horizon prediction, recovers true system parameters, and significantly improves physical grounding over purely data-driven models. These results demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of learning physically interpretable world models directly from images under weak supervision.</p></details> |  | None |

This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

In scientific corpora, where novelty is prized, identifying underrepresented niche topics is particularly important. However, contemporary models built from dense transformer embeddings tend to miss rare topics and therefore also fail to capture smooth temporal alignment. We propose a geometric method that integrates multimodal text and co-author network data, using Hellinger distances and Ward's linkage to construct a hierarchical topic dendrogram. This approach captures both local and global structure, supporting multiscale learning across semantic and temporal dimensions. Our method effectively identifies rare-topic structure and visualizes smooth topic drift over time. Experiments highlight the strength of interpretable bag-of-words models when paired with principled geometric alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 2025 IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing</p></details> | None |
| **[HUMORCHAIN: Theory-Guided Multi-Stage Reasoning for Interpretable Multimodal Humor Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21732v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humor, as both a creative human activity and a social binding mechanism, has long posed a major challenge for AI generation. Although producing humor requires complex cognitive reasoning and social understanding, theories of humor suggest that it follows learnable patterns and structures, making it theoretically possible for generative models to acquire them implicitly. In recent years, multimodal humor has become a prevalent form of online communication, especially among Gen Z, highlighting the need for AI systems capable of integrating visual understanding with humorous language generation. However, existing data-driven approaches lack explicit modeling or theoretical grounding of humor, often producing literal descriptions that fail to capture its underlying cognitive mechanisms, resulting in the generated image descriptions that are fluent but lack genuine humor or cognitive depth. To address this limitation, we propose HUMORCHAIN (HUmor-guided Multi-step Orchestrated Reasoning Chain for Image Captioning), a theory-guided multi-stage reasoning framework. It integrates visual semantic parsing, humor- and psychology-based reasoning, and a fine-tuned discriminator for humor evaluation, forming an interpretable and controllable cognitive reasoning chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly embed cognitive structures from humor theories into multimodal humor generation, enabling a structured reasoning process from visual understanding to humor creation. Experiments on Meme-Image-No-Text, Oogiri-GO, and OxfordTVG-HIC datasets show that HUMORCHAIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in human humor preference, Elo/BT scores, and semantic diversity, demonstrating that theory-driven structured reasoning enables large language models to generate humor aligned with human perception.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional evaluation methods, general reward functions or similarity-based metrics, fail to capture the diversity and complexity of personal visual tastes. In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent. We further introduce PIGBench, a per-user preference benchmark capturing diverse visual interpretations of shared prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIGReward surpasses existing methods in both accuracy and interpretability, establishing a scalable and reasoning-based foundation for personalized T2I evaluation and optimization. Taken together, our findings highlight PIGReward as a robust steptoward individually aligned T2I generation.</p></details> |  | None |

This study leverages BiomedCLIP as a foundation model to address challenges in model generalization. BiomedCLIP was adapted for automated BI-RADS breast density classification using multi-modality mammographic data (synthesized 2D images, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis). Using 96,995 images, we compared single-modality (s2D only) and multi-modality training approaches, addressing class imbalance through weighted contrastive learning. Both approaches achieved similar accuracy (multi-modality: 0.74, single-modality: 0.73), with the multi-modality model offering broader applicability across different imaging modalities and higher AUC values consistently above 0.84 across BI-RADS categories. External validation on the RSNA and EMBED datasets showed strong generalization capabilities (AUC range: 0.80-0.93). GradCAM visualizations confirmed consistent and clinically relevant attention patterns, highlighting the models interpretability and robustness. This research underscores the potential of foundation models for breast imaging applications, paving the way for future extensions for diagnostic tasks.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |

To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender, race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models, with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and fairness-aware multimodal assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop (Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle)</p></details> | None |

Yet, its potential in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains largely untapped, hindered by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the rich, spatially grounded reasoning intrinsic to visual understanding. Existing visual-CoT resources are typically small, domain-specific, or lack the human-like stepwise structure necessary for compositional visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisReason, a large-scale dataset designed to advance visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VisReason comprises 489K annotated examples spanning four diverse domains, each featuring multi-round, human-like rationales that guide MLLMs through interpretable visual reasoning steps. Building upon this, we curate VisReason-Pro, a 165K subset produced with a stronger expert-level GPT annotator, enriched with detailed reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding via depth-informed annotations. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization. These results demonstrate that VisReason equips MLLMs with more systematic and generalizable reasoning capabilities. We envision VisReason as a cornerstone for cultivating human-like visual reasoning, paving the way toward the next generation of multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |

The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

| **[Understanding Counting Mechanisms in Large Language and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17699v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks. We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder.</p></details> |  | None |

These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/be-chen/REMSA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/be-chen/REMSA) |

Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

While prior works have demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this, we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1 accuracy, compared to a 3% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep learning models.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (Oral) | None |

Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling.

However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |

Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current assessment practices still rely heavily on expert-based subjective scoring, which is both labor-intensive and inherently subjective. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for automatic and interpretable creativity assessment from drawings. Motivated by the cognitive evidence proposed in [6] that creativity can emerge from both what is drawn (content) and how it is drawn (style), we reinterpret the creativity score as a function of these two complementary dimensions. Specifically, we first augment an existing creativity-labeled dataset with additional annotations targeting content categories. Based on the enriched dataset, we further propose a conditional model predicting content, style, and ratings simultaneously. In particular, the conditional learning mechanism that enables the model to adapt its visual feature extraction by dynamically tuning it to creativity-relevant signals conditioned on the drawing's stylistic and semantic cues. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing regression-based approaches and offers interpretable visualizations that align well with human judgments.

We also collaborate with pathologists from Yale School of Medicine to demonstrate that TeamPath can assist them in working more efficiently by identifying and correcting expert conclusions and reasoning paths.

Using a critical qualitative design, the study conducted zero-shot prompt testing with two leading systems, ChatGPT-4 Turbo and Gemini 1.5, and collected real-time outputs from Global North and South contexts. A critical interpretive analysis traced textual, visual, and structural patterns that revealed forms of digital neocolonialism and their implications for educational equity. Findings show six ways in which GenAI can reinforce Western dominance. Western curriculum assumptions appeared when Gemini listed the same four seasons for the United States and Ghana, reflecting Western climatology and overlooking regional knowledge systems. Other patterns included cultural stereotyping in imagery, Western-centered examples in instructional outputs, limited support for Indigenous and local languages, underrepresentation of non-Western identities in visuals, and access barriers linked to subscription-based models. These patterns demonstrate how GenAI can reproduce inequities even as it introduces new educational opportunities. In response, the study proposes a dual-pathway mitigation model. The Inclusive AI Design pathway includes three components: liberatory design methods that center non-Western epistemologies, anticipatory approaches to reduce representational harm, and decentralized GenAI hubs that support local participation and data sovereignty. The pedagogical pathway, human-centric prompt engineering, equips educators to contextualize prompts and critically engage with outputs. Together, these pathways position GenAI as a tool that can support more equitable and culturally responsive education.</p></details> |  | None |

Aligned face photographs (CelebA, 260k images, 40 attributes) are translated into vector sketches suitable for an XY plotter. We study how to 'write' these drawings for a sequence model, comparing absolute vs. relative point encodings and random vs. travel-minimizing stroke order. A bidirectional LSTM is trained for attribute prediction; a minimal architectural change, removing the global average over the sequence and applying a Dense layer at each point, yields per point attribute scores. Aggregating points whose score exceeds an attribute specific threshold across many portraits produces new drawings we call FaCells: statistical abstractions of attributes such as Eyeglasses, Wavy Hair, or Bangs. Across ablations, absolute coordinates with travel-minimizing order and a global average readout perform best; this configuration is then adapted to produce per-point scores. Multilabel training over 40 attributes is stable, and attributes reaching at least 50% balanced accuracy are visualized as FaCells. Complementary notions (e.g., No_Beard) are constructed by selecting points below a negative threshold. FaCells foregrounds interpretability as a creative tool: the resulting works are plotter ready, reproducible, and inexpensive to realize, yet materially present. Presented at Spectrum Miami 2025, the project bridges data, model, and paper while acknowledging the limits of the labels and the biases of the dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces a clinician-centered framework to quantify hallucination risks by evaluating diagnostic precision, recommendation quality, reasoning robustness, output coherence, and knowledge alignment. We assessed six leading LLMs across 30 expert-validated spinal cases. DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior overall performance (total score: 86.03 $\pm$ 2.08), particularly in high-stakes domains such as trauma and infection. A critical finding reveals that reasoning-enhanced model variants did not uniformly outperform standard counterparts: Claude-3.7-Sonnet's extended thinking mode underperformed relative to its standard version (80.79 $\pm$ 1.83 vs. 81.56 $\pm$ 1.92), indicating extended chain-of-thought reasoning alone is insufficient for clinical reliability. Multidimensional stress-testing exposed model-specific vulnerabilities, with recommendation quality degrading by 7.4% under amplified complexity. This decline contrasted with marginal improvements in rationality (+2.0%), readability (+1.7%) and diagnosis (+4.7%), highlighting a concerning divergence between perceived coherence and actionable guidance. Our findings advocate integrating interpretability mechanisms (e.g., reasoning chain visualization) into clinical workflows and establish a safety-aware validation framework for surgical LLM deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
