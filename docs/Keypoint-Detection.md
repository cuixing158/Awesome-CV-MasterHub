| **[Perception-Control Coupled Visual Servoing for Textureless Objects Using Keypoint-Based EKF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06834v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual servoing is fundamental to robotic applications, enabling precise positioning and control. However, applying it to textureless objects remains a challenge due to the absence of reliable visual features. Moreover, adverse visual conditions, such as occlusions, often corrupt visual feedback, leading to reduced accuracy and instability in visual servoing. In this work, we build upon learning-based keypoint detection for textureless objects and propose a method that enhances robustness by tightly integrating perception and control in a closed loop. Specifically, we employ an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that integrates per-frame keypoint measurements to estimate 6D object pose, which drives pose-based visual servoing (PBVS) for control. The resulting camera motion, in turn, enhances the tracking of subsequent keypoints, effectively closing the perception-control loop. Additionally, unlike standard PBVS, we propose a probabilistic control law that computes both camera velocity and its associated uncertainty, enabling uncertainty-aware control for safe and reliable operation. We validate our approach on real-world robotic platforms using quantitative metrics and grasping experiments, demonstrating that our method outperforms traditional visual servoing techniques in both accuracy and practical application.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DroneKey++: A Size Prior-free Method and New Benchmark for Drone 3D Pose Estimation from Sequential Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06211v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D pose estimation of drones is essential for security and surveillance systems. However, existing methods often rely on prior drone information such as physical sizes or 3D meshes. At the same time, current datasets are small-scale, limited to single models, and collected under constrained environments, which makes reliable validation of generalization difficult. We present DroneKey++, a prior-free framework that jointly performs keypoint detection, drone classification, and 3D pose estimation. The framework employs a keypoint encoder for simultaneous keypoint detection and classification, and a pose decoder that estimates 3D pose using ray-based geometric reasoning and class embeddings. To address dataset limitations, we construct 6DroneSyn, a large-scale synthetic benchmark with over 50K images covering 7 drone models and 88 outdoor backgrounds, generated using 360-degree panoramic synthesis. Experiments show that DroneKey++ achieves MAE 17.34 deg and MedAE 17.1 deg for rotation, MAE 0.135 m and MedAE 0.242 m for translation, with inference speeds of 19.25 FPS (CPU) and 414.07 FPS (GPU), demonstrating both strong generalization across drone models and suitability for real-time applications. The dataset is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 page, 5 figures, 6 tables, Accepted to ICRA 2026 (to appear)</p></details> | None |
| **[Coarse-to-Fine Non-rigid Multi-modal Image Registration for Historical Panel Paintings based on Crack Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16348v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Art technological investigations of historical panel paintings rely on acquiring multi-modal image data, including visual light photography, infrared reflectography, ultraviolet fluorescence photography, x-radiography, and macro photography. For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, submitted for review</p></details> | None |
| **[ZENITH: Automated Gradient Norm Informed Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15212v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep computer vision models requires manual oversight or hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate (LR) schedule. While existing adaptive optimizers schedule the LR automatically, they suffer from computational and memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices. In this work, we introduce the ZENITH (Zero-overhead Evolution using Norm-Informed Training History) optimizer, which adapts the LR using the temporal evolution of the gradient norm. Image classification experiments spanning 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks demonstrate that ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time than baselines. It also yielded superior mAP in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation on MS COCO using the R-CNN family of models. Furthermore, its compatibility with regularization enables even better generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UnrealPose: Leveraging Game Engine Kinematics for Large-Scale Synthetic Human Pose Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00991v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diverse, accurately labeled 3D human pose data is expensive and studio-bound, while in-the-wild datasets lack known ground truth. We introduce UnrealPose-Gen, an Unreal Engine 5 pipeline built on Movie Render Queue for high-quality offline rendering. Our generated frames include: (i) 3D joints in world and camera coordinates, (ii) 2D projections and COCO-style keypoints with occlusion and joint-visibility flags, (iii) person bounding boxes, and (iv) camera intrinsics and extrinsics. We use UnrealPose-Gen to present UnrealPose-1M, an approximately one million frame corpus comprising eight sequences: five scripted "coherent" sequences spanning five scenes, approximately 40 actions, and five subjects; and three randomized sequences across three scenes, approximately 100 actions, and five subjects, all captured from diverse camera trajectories for broad viewpoint coverage. As a fidelity check, we report real-to-synthetic results on four tasks: image-to-3D pose, 2D keypoint detection, 2D-to-3D lifting, and person detection/segmentation. Though time and resources constrain us from an unlimited dataset, we release the UnrealPose-1M dataset, as well as the UnrealPose-Gen pipeline to support third-party generation of human pose data.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2026 submission.

| **[BLANKET: Anonymizing Faces in Infant Video Recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15542v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the ethical use of video data involving human subjects, particularly infants, requires robust anonymization methods. We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts. Both methods alter the identity, and our method outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in all other respects. The code is available as an easy-to-use anonymization demo at https://github.com/ctu-vras/blanket-infant-face-anonym.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/ctu-vras/blanket-infant-face-anonym</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ctu-vras/blanket-infant-face-anonym) |
| **[Off The Grid: Detection of Primitives for Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15508v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models enable real-time scene generation but are hindered by suboptimal pixel-aligned primitive placement, which relies on a dense, rigid grid and limits both quality and efficiency. We introduce a new feed-forward architecture that detects 3D Gaussian primitives at a sub-pixel level, replacing the pixel grid with an adaptive, "Off The Grid" distribution. Inspired by keypoint detection, our multi-resolution decoder learns to distribute primitives across image patches. This module is trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning. Our resulting pose-free model generates photorealistic scenes in seconds, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models. It outperforms competitors while using far fewer primitives, demonstrating a more accurate and efficient allocation that captures fine details and reduces artifacts. Moreover, we observe that by learning to render 3D Gaussians, our 3D reconstruction backbone improves camera pose estimation, suggesting opportunities to train these foundational models without labels.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[JoVA: Unified Multimodal Learning for Joint Video-Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13677v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present JoVA, a unified framework for joint video-audio generation. Despite recent encouraging advances, existing methods face two critical limitations. First, most existing approaches can only generate ambient sounds and lack the capability to produce human speech synchronized with lip movements. Second, recent attempts at unified human video-audio generation typically rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules, which introduce additional architecture design and weaken the model simplicity of the original transformers. To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that JoVA outperforms or is competitive with both unified and audio-driven state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity. Our results establish JoVA as an elegant framework for high-quality multimodal generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: \url{https://visual-ai.github.io/jova}</p></details> | [Code Link](https://visual-ai.github.io/jova) |
| **[UnCageNet: Tracking and Pose Estimation of Caged Animal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07712v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animal tracking and pose estimation systems, such as STEP (Simultaneous Tracking and Pose Estimation) and ViTPose, experience substantial performance drops when processing images and videos with cage structures and systematic occlusions. We present a three-stage preprocessing pipeline that addresses this limitation through: (1) cage segmentation using a Gabor-enhanced ResNet-UNet architecture with tunable orientation filters, (2) cage inpainting using CRFill for content-aware reconstruction of occluded regions, and (3) evaluation of pose estimation and tracking on the uncaged frames. Our Gabor-enhanced segmentation model leverages orientation-aware features with 72 directional kernels to accurately identify and segment cage structures that severely impair the performance of existing methods. Experimental validation demonstrates that removing cage occlusions through our pipeline enables pose estimation and tracking performance comparable to that in environments without occlusions. We also observe significant improvements in keypoint detection accuracy and trajectory consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Inference-time Stochastic Refinement of GRU-Normalizing Flow for Real-time Video Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04282v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SynPlay: Large-Scale Synthetic Human Data with Real-World Diversity for Aerial-View Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11814v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SynPlay, a large-scale synthetic human dataset purpose-built for advancing multi-perspective human localization, with a predominant focus on aerial-view perception. SynPlay departs from traditional synthetic datasets by addressing a critical but underexplored challenge: localizing humans in aerial scenes where subjects often occupy only tens of pixels in the image. In such scenarios, fine-grained details like facial features or textures become irrelevant, shifting the burden of recognition to human motion, behavior, and interactions. To meet this need, SynPlay implements a novel rule-guided motion generation framework that combines real-world motion capture with motion evolution graphs. This design enables human actions to evolve dynamically through high-level game rules rather than predefined scripts, resulting in effectively uncountable motion variations. Unlike existing synthetic datasets-which either focus on static visual traits or reuse a limited set of mocap-driven actions-SynPlay captures a wide spectrum of spontaneous behaviors, including complex interactions that naturally emerge from unscripted gameplay scenarios. SynPlay also introduces an extensive multi-camera setup that spans UAVs at random altitudes, CCTVs, and a freely roaming UGV, achieving true near-to-far perspective coverage in a single dataset. The majority of instances are captured from aerial viewpoints at varying scales, directly supporting the development of models for long-range human analysis-a setting where existing datasets fall short. Our data contains over 73k images and 6.5M human instances, with detailed annotations for detection, segmentation, and keypoint tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with SynPlay significantly improves human localization performance, especially in few-shot and data-scarce scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://synplaydataset.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[UMind-VL: A Generalist Ultrasound Vision-Language Model for Unified Grounded Perception and Comprehensive Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22256v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant strides in medical foundation models, the ultrasound domain lacks a comprehensive solution capable of bridging low-level Ultrasound Grounded Perception (e.g., segmentation, localization) and high-level Ultrasound Comprehensive Interpretation (e.g., diagnosis, reasoning). To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D Affordance Keypoint Detection for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22195v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for affordance-informed robotic manipulation by introducing 3D keypoints to enhance the understanding of object parts' functionality. The proposed approach provides direct information about what the potential use of objects is, as well as guidance on where and how a manipulator should engage, whereas conventional methods treat affordance detection as a semantic segmentation task, focusing solely on answering the what question. To address this gap, we propose a Fusion-based Affordance Keypoint Network (FAKP-Net) by introducing 3D keypoint quadruplet that harnesses the synergistic potential of RGB and Depth image to provide information on execution position, direction, and extent. Benchmark testing demonstrates that FAKP-Net outperforms existing models by significant margins in affordance segmentation task and keypoint detection task. Real-world experiments also showcase the reliability of our method in accomplishing manipulation tasks with previously unseen objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification for Visual Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21666v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying the uncertainty of an object's pose estimate is essential for robust control and planning. Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds. We release code at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Uplifting Table Tennis: A Robust, Real-World Application for 3D Trajectory and Spin Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20250v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining the precise 3D motion of a table tennis ball from standard monocular videos is a challenging problem, as existing methods trained on synthetic data struggle to generalize to the noisy, imperfect ball and table detections of the real world. This is primarily due to the inherent lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real-world video. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates. By integrating a ball detector and a table keypoint detector, our approach transforms a proof-of-concept uplifting method into a practical, robust, and high-performing end-to-end application for 3D table tennis trajectory and spin analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Simultaneous Localization and 3D-Semi Dense Mapping for Micro Drones Using Monocular Camera and Inertial Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14335v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms estimate drone poses and build a 3D map using a single camera. Current algorithms include sparse methods that lack detailed geometry, while learning-driven approaches produce dense maps but are computationally intensive. Monocular SLAM also faces scale ambiguities, which affect its accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware lightweight monocular SLAM system combining sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction. Our method employs deep learning-based depth prediction and edge detection, followed by optimization to refine keypoints and edges for geometric consistency, without relying on global loop closure or heavy neural computations. We fuse inertial data with vision by using an extended Kalman filter to resolve scale ambiguity and improve accuracy. The system operates in real time on low-power platforms, as demonstrated on a DJI Tello drone with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. In addition, we demonstrate robust autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor corridors and on the TUM RGBD dataset. Our approach offers an effective, practical solution to real-time mapping and navigation in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Using an agentic framework with multiple tool-calling capabilities, Orion is designed for visual AI tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results. Unlike traditional vision-language models that produce descriptive outputs, Orion orchestrates a suite of specialized computer vision tools, including object detection, keypoint localization, panoptic segmentation, Optical Character Recognition, and geometric analysis, to execute complex multi-step visual workflows. The system achieves competitive performance on MMMU, MMBench, DocVQA, and MMLongBench while extending monolithic vision-language models to production-grade visual intelligence. By combining neural perception with symbolic execution, Orion enables autonomous visual reasoning, marking a transition from passive visual understanding to active, tool-driven visual intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[End-to-End Multi-Person Pose Estimation with Pose-Aware Video Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13208v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multi-person video pose estimation methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline: detecting individuals in each frame, followed by temporal modeling for single-person pose estimation. This design relies on heuristic operations such as detection, RoI cropping, and non-maximum suppression (NMS), limiting both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present a fully end-to-end framework for multi-person 2D pose estimation in videos, effectively eliminating heuristic operations. A key challenge is to associate individuals across frames under complex and overlapping temporal trajectories. To address this, we introduce a novel Pose-Aware Video transformEr Network (PAVE-Net), which features a spatial encoder to model intra-frame relations and a spatiotemporal pose decoder to capture global dependencies across frames. To achieve accurate temporal association, we propose a pose-aware attention mechanism that enables each pose query to selectively aggregate features corresponding to the same individual across consecutive frames.Additionally, we explicitly model spatiotemporal dependencies among pose keypoints to improve accuracy. Notably, our approach is the first end-to-end method for multi-frame 2D human pose estimation.Extensive experiments show that PAVE-Net substantially outperforms prior image-based end-to-end methods, achieving a \textbf{6.0} mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017, and delivers accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art two-stage video-based approaches, while offering significant gains in efficiency.Project page: https://github.com/zgspose/PAVENet</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/zgspose/PAVENet) |

Real-time UE detection has been limited, largely due to the ethical and privacy challenges of obtaining annotated ICU video data. We propose Augmented Unplanned Removal Alert (AURA), a vision-based risk detection system developed and validated entirely on a fully synthetic video dataset. By leveraging text-to-video diffusion, we generated diverse and clinically realistic ICU scenarios capturing a range of patient behaviors and care contexts. The system applies pose estimation to identify two high-risk movement patterns: collision, defined as hand entry into spatial zones near airway tubes, and agitation, quantified by the velocity of tracked anatomical keypoints. Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition. This work demonstrates a novel pathway for developing privacy-preserving, reproducible patient safety monitoring systems with potential for deployment in intensive care settings.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Semi-distributed Cross-modal Air-Ground Relative Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06749v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient, accurate, and flexible relative localization is crucial in air-ground collaborative tasks. However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.</p></details> |  | None |

To scale data collection, many researchers have turned to leveraging human manipulation videos available online. However, current methods predominantly focus on hand detection or object pose estimation, failing to fully exploit the rich interaction cues embedded in these videos. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines large foundation models for video understanding with point tracking techniques to extract dense trajectories of all task-relevant keypoints during manipulation. This enables more comprehensive utilization of Internet-scale human demonstration videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately track keypoints throughout the entire manipulation process, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RSS 2025 Workshop</p></details> | None |

It enables the automation of the mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model suitable for power plant maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 18 figures.

| **[Cross-Species Transfer Learning in Agricultural AI: Evaluating ZebraPose Adaptation for Dairy Cattle Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22618v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock, especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations - a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments. While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87, PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 6 Tables</p></details> | None |
| **[SemiETPicker: Fast and Label-Efficient Particle Picking for CryoET Tomography Using Semi-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22454v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging (SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent, all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density, repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of 0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003 (correct matches).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 7 equations</p></details> | None |

We constructed a database of approximately 3,000 anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a `Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task, a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge. To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025 MLLMCP Workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[HandEval: Taking the First Step Towards Hand Quality Evaluation in Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08978v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Surgical Robotic Instrument Pose Reconstruction in Real World Conditions Using Unified Feature Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03532v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate camera-to-robot calibration is essential for any vision-based robotic control system and especially critical in minimally invasive surgical robots, where instruments conduct precise micro-manipulations. However, MIS robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions; however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging surgical environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Invisibility Cloak: Disappearance under Human Pose Estimation via Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07670v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being significant in autonomous systems, Human Pose Estimation (HPE)'s potential risks to adversarial attacks have not received comparable attention with image classification or segmentation tasks. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of HPE systems to disappearance attacks, where the attacker aims to subtly alter the HPE training process via backdoor techniques so that any input image with some specific trigger will not be recognized as involving any human pose. As humans are typically at the center of HPE systems, a successful attack will severely threaten pedestrians' lives if a self-driving car incorrectly understands the front scene. To achieve the adversarial goal of disappearance, we propose \emph{IntC}, a general framework to craft an invisibility cloak in the HPE domain. By designing target HPE labels that do not represent any human pose, we propose three specific backdoor attacks based on our IntC framework. IntC-S and IntC-E, respectively designed for regression- and heatmap-based HPE techniques, concentrate the keypoints of triggered images in a tiny, imperceptible region. Further, to improve the attack's stealthiness, IntC-L designs the target poisons to capture the label outputs of typical landscape images without a human involved, achieving disappearance and reducing detectability simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our IntC methods in achieving the disappearance goal. By revealing the vulnerability of HPE to disappearance and backdoor attacks, we hope our work can raise awareness of the potential risks when HPE models are deployed in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Predicting Penalty Kick Direction Using Multi-Modal Deep Learning with Pose-Guided Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26088v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window. This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89% accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical analysis, and real-time game analytics.</p></details> |  | None |

YOLO26, released in September 2025, stands as the newest and most advanced member of the YOLO family, purpose-built to deliver efficiency, accuracy, and deployment readiness on edge and low-power devices. The paper sequentially details architectural innovations of YOLO26, including the removal of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), adoption of end-to-end NMS-free inference, integration of ProgLoss and Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stable convergence. Beyond architecture, the study positions YOLO26 as a multi-task framework, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, pose/keypoints estimation, oriented detection, and classification. We present performance benchmarks of YOLO26 on edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Orin, comparing its results with YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12, YOLOv13, and transformer-based detectors(RF-DETR and RT-DETR). This paper further explores real-time deployment pathways, flexible export options (ONNX, TensorRT, CoreML, TFLite), and quantization for INT8/FP16. Practical use cases of YOLO26 across robotics, manufacturing, and IoT are highlighted to demonstrate cross-industry adaptability. Finally, insights on deployment efficiency and broader implications are discussed, with future directions for YOLO26 and the YOLO lineage outlined.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Certifiable Semantic Robustness via Robust Pruning of Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00083v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast. However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared to baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SuperEvent: Cross-Modal Learning of Event-based Keypoint Detection for SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00139v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based keypoint detection and matching holds significant potential, enabling the integration of event sensors into highly optimized Visual SLAM systems developed for frame cameras over decades of research. Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

| **[PANICL: Mitigating Over-Reliance on Single Prompt in Visual In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21926v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training. Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation, single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover, PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM, highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures | None |
| **[Category-Level Object Shape and Pose Estimation in Less Than a Millisecond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18979v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object shape and pose estimation is a foundational robotics problem, supporting tasks from manipulation to scene understanding and navigation. We present a fast local solver for shape and pose estimation which requires only category-level object priors and admits an efficient certificate of global optimality. Given an RGB-D image of an object, we use a learned front-end to detect sparse, category-level semantic keypoints on the target object. We represent the target object's unknown shape using a linear active shape model and pose a maximum a posteriori optimization problem to solve for position, orientation, and shape simultaneously. Expressed in unit quaternions, this problem admits first-order optimality conditions in the form of an eigenvalue problem with eigenvector nonlinearities. Our primary contribution is to solve this problem efficiently with self-consistent field iteration, which only requires computing a 4-by-4 matrix and finding its minimum eigenvalue-vector pair at each iterate. Solving a linear system for the corresponding Lagrange multipliers gives a simple global optimality certificate. One iteration of our solver runs in about 100 microseconds, enabling fast outlier rejection. We test our method on synthetic data and a variety of real-world settings, including two public datasets and a drone tracking scenario.

Hybrid pipelines that combine object detection, keypoint regression, and Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers have recently achieved strong results on synthetic datasets, yet their performance deteriorates sharply on real or lab-generated imagery due to the persistent synthetic-to-real domain gap. Existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches aim to mitigate this issue but often underperform when a modest number of labeled target samples are available. In this work, we propose the first Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) framework tailored for SPE keypoint regression. Building on the Learning Invariant Representation and Risk (LIRR) paradigm, our method jointly optimizes domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk using both labeled synthetic and limited labeled real data, thereby reducing generalization error under domain shift. Extensive experiments on the SPEED+ benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms source-only, fine-tuning, and oracle baselines. Notably, with only 5% labeled target data, our method matches or surpasses oracle performance trained on larger fractions of labeled data. The framework is lightweight, backbone-agnostic, and computationally efficient, offering a practical pathway toward robust and deployable spacecraft pose estimation in real-world space environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests. Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

However, uneven trajectory density often leads to frag-mented roads in sparse areas and redundant segments in dense regions, posing significant challenges for existing methods. To address these issues, we propose DGMap, a dual-decoding framework with global context awareness, featuring Multi-scale Grid Encoding, Mask-enhanced Keypoint Extraction, and Global Context-aware Relation Prediction. By integrating global semantic context with local geometric features, DGMap improves keypoint detection accuracy to reduce road fragmentation in sparse-trajectory areas. Additionally, the Global Context-aware Relation Prediction module suppresses false connections in dense-trajectory regions by modeling long-range trajectory patterns. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DGMap outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5% in APLS, with notable performance gains on trajectory data from the Didi Chuxing platform</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity visual data in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, or high dynamic range scenes, thereby limiting the performance of state-of-the-art CV systems. Computational imaging techniques, including light field imaging, high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, deblurring, high-speed imaging, and glare mitigation, address these limitations by enhancing image acquisition and reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth estimation, optical flow, face recognition, and keypoint detection. By analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities, challenges, and future research directions.

In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Highlight | None |

This subjectivity limits the sensitivity of assessments to detect subtle motor improvements, which are critical for personalized rehabilitation planning. Recent progress in computer vision offers promising avenues for enabling objective, quantitative, and scalable assessment of UE motor function. Among standardized tests, the Box and Block Test (BBT) is widely utilized for measuring gross manual dexterity and tracking stroke recovery, providing a structured setting that lends itself well to computational analysis. However, existing datasets targeting stroke rehabilitation primarily focus on daily living activities and often fail to capture clinically structured assessments such as block transfer tasks. Furthermore, many available datasets include a mixture of healthy and stroke-affected individuals, limiting their specificity and clinical utility. To address these critical gaps, we introduce StrokeVision-Bench, the first-ever dedicated dataset of stroke patients performing clinically structured block transfer tasks. StrokeVision-Bench comprises 1,000 annotated videos categorized into four clinically meaningful action classes, with each sample represented in two modalities: raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints. We benchmark several state-of-the-art video action recognition and skeleton-based action classification methods to establish performance baselines for this domain and facilitate future research in automated stroke rehabilitation assessment.</p></details> | 6 pages | None |

Experimental results show that with only two epochs of fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally, improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For 3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of 0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability.

A common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen object categories.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures | None |

Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets. Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back) were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect lameness with as little as one second of video data.</p></details> |  | None |

Using the T-LEAP pose estimation model, the motion of nine keypoints was extracted from videos of walking cows. The videos were recorded outdoors, with varying illumination conditions, and T-LEAP extracted 99.6% of correct keypoints. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used to compute six locomotion traits: back posture measurement, head bobbing, tracking distance, stride length, stance duration, and swing duration. The three most important traits were back posture measurement, head bobbing, and tracking distance. For the ground truth, we showed that a thoughtful merging of the scores of the observers could improve intra-observer reliability and agreement. We showed that including multiple locomotion traits improves the classification accuracy from 76.6% with only one trait to 79.9% with the three most important traits and to 80.1% with all six locomotion traits.</p></details> |  | None |

However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii) a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision that can be used downstream for fault detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted at DASC 2025</p></details> | None |

ICL has recently been explored for computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task better and further improve the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, this approach lacks depth information in the image and often detects keypoints on the background. To address this, we propose Distill-DKP, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages depth maps and RGB images for keypoint detection in a self-supervised setting. During training, Distill-DKP extracts embedding-level knowledge from a depth-based teacher model to guide an image-based student model with inference restricted to the student. Experiments show that Distill-DKP significantly outperforms previous unsupervised methods by reducing mean L2 error by 47.15% on Human3.6M, mean average error by 5.67% on Taichi, and improving keypoints accuracy by 1.3% on DeepFashion dataset. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate the sensitivity of knowledge distillation across different layers of the network.

Advancements in field management through non-chemical weeding by robots in combination with monitoring of crops by autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and breeding of novel and more resilient crop varieties are helpful to address these challenges. The analysis of plant traits, called phenotyping, is an essential activity in plant breeding, it however involves a great amount of manual labor. With this paper, we address the problem of automatic fine-grained organ-level geometric analysis needed for precision phenotyping. As the availability of real-world data in this domain is relatively scarce, we propose a novel dataset that was acquired using UAVs capturing high-resolution images of a real breeding trial containing 48 plant varieties and therefore covering great morphological and appearance diversity. This enables the development of approaches for autonomous phenotyping that generalize well to different varieties. Based on overlapping high-resolution images from multiple viewing angles, we compute photogrammetric dense point clouds and provide detailed and accurate point-wise labels for plants, leaves, and salient points as the tip and the base. Additionally, we include measurements of phenotypic traits performed by experts from the German Federal Plant Variety Office on the real plants, allowing the evaluation of new approaches not only on segmentation and keypoint detection but also directly on the downstream tasks. The provided labeled point clouds enable fine-grained plant analysis and support further progress in the development of automatic phenotyping approaches, but also enable further research in surface reconstruction, point cloud completion, and semantic interpretation of point clouds.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AugLift: Boosting Generalization in Lifting-based 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07112v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly improves generalization performance without requiring additional data collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models (e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures. Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$, while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model.

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1) Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios, achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025. 8 pages main paper, 8 figures, plus supplementary material</p></details> | None |
| **[Head Anchor Enhanced Detection and Association for Crowded Pedestrian Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05514v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection features from both the regression and classification branches of an object detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions, integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes. By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded environments where occlusions are prevalent.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics, object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7 to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is readily transferable to other 3D tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

This architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial inspections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 ICCV VISION Workshop</p></details> | None |

Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

To date, research has primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks. However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs (teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks that rely on preserving spatial detail.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing LABR navigation methods are limited by suboptimal trajectories from mapping-based approaches and the excessive computational demands of learning-based methods. To address this, we propose a two-stage lightweight framework that integrates global key points prediction with local trajectory refinement to generate efficient and reachable trajectories. In the first stage, the Global Key points Prediction Network (GKPN) was used to generate a hybrid land-air keypoint path. The GKPN includes a Sobel Perception Network (SPN) for improved obstacle detection and a Lightweight Attention Planning Network (LAPN) to improves predictive ability by capturing contextual information. In the second stage, the global path is segmented based on predicted key points and refined using a mapping-based planner to create smooth, collision-free trajectories. Experiments conducted on our LABR platform show that our framework reduces network parameters by 14\% and energy consumption during land-air transitions by 35\% compared to existing approaches.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data, such as GPT-4o, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across both text and images. But can they truly be used for this task in a zero-shot setting? And what are their limitations? In this paper, we explore these research questions via the free-form language-based robotic grasping task, and propose a novel method, FreeGrasp, leveraging the pre-trained VLMs' world knowledge to reason about human instructions and object spatial arrangements. Our method detects all objects as keypoints and uses these keypoints to annotate marks on images, aiming to facilitate GPT-4o's zero-shot spatial reasoning. This allows our method to determine whether a requested object is directly graspable or if other objects must be grasped and removed first. Since no existing dataset is specifically designed for this task, we introduce a synthetic dataset FreeGraspData by extending the MetaGraspNetV2 dataset with human-annotated instructions and ground-truth grasping sequences.

Existing methods primarily extract features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed solution integrates a UAV with ROS2 framework, that utilizes multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN) for search missions. System identification and PD controller deployment are performed for autonomous UAV navigation. The ROS2 environment utilizes the YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN for face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face recognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV operator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and immediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on specific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN model. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a safe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is performed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system parameters are used to design PD controllers that utilize YOLOv11-pose to estimate the distance between the UAVs camera and the identified individual. The initial experiments, conducted on 14 known individuals, demonstrated that the proposed subsystem can be successfully used in real time. The next step involves implementing the system on a large experimental UAV for field use and integrating autonomous navigation with GPS-guided control for rescue operations planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted and presented on the 34th International Conference on Robotics in Alpe-Adria-Danube Region, RAAD 2025, Belgrade Serbia</p></details> | None |

To address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a shared descriptor space. A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg benchmark. Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS field-of-view variation.

While current mainstream approaches to digital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations, interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less attention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high rendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and real-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient and expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered segmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables dynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present CartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital humans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape basis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes suitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based on facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the rapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that closely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute.

However, their dense and irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization. Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions, enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level anomaly detection, even using only raw features.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BEV-LIO(LC): BEV Image Assisted LiDAR-Inertial Odometry with Loop Closure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19242v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces BEV-LIO(LC), a novel LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) framework that combines Bird's Eye View (BEV) image representations of LiDAR data with geometry-based point cloud registration and incorporates loop closure (LC) through BEV image features. By normalizing point density, we project LiDAR point clouds into BEV images, thereby enabling efficient feature extraction and matching. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extractor is employed to extract distinctive local and global descriptors from the BEV images. Local descriptors are used to match BEV images with FAST keypoints for reprojection error construction, while global descriptors facilitate loop closure detection. Reprojection error minimization is then integrated with point-to-plane registration within an iterated Extended Kalman Filter (iEKF). In the back-end, global descriptors are used to create a KD-tree-indexed keyframe database for accurate loop closure detection. When a loop closure is detected, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) computes a coarse transform from BEV image matching, which serves as the initial estimate for Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The refined transform is subsequently incorporated into a factor graph along with odometry factors, improving the global consistency of localization. Extensive experiments conducted in various scenarios with different LiDAR types demonstrate that BEV-LIO(LC) outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving competitive localization accuracy.

However, these models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects, particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over 500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles, and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++ to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization. Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative implications for human-AI interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended Version of KptLLM. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.01846</p></details> | None |

Considering the high demands on pose estimation accuracy, mainstream monocular pose estimation methods typically consist of keypoint detectors and PnP solver. However, current keypoint detectors remain vulnerable to structural symmetry and partial occlusion of non-cooperative spacecraft. To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages the geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate keypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft keypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000 simulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations. Extensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy and effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft keypoint detectors.

In contrast to conventional training regimes that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust keypoint extractor. RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the discriminative capability of the learned descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust keypoint extraction and description.

Traditionally, matching is performed by assigning descriptors to interest points and identifying correspondences based on descriptor similarity. This work introduces a technique where interest points are inherently associated during detection, eliminating the need for computing, storing, transmitting, or matching descriptors. Although the matching accuracy is marginally lower than that of conventional approaches, our method completely eliminates the need for descriptors, leading to a drastic reduction in memory usage for localization systems.

Nevertheless, in complex traffic scenarios, conventional pose estimation approaches frequently fail to accurately reconstruct occluded keypoints, primarily due to obstructions caused by vehicles, vegetation, or architectural elements. To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time occluded pedestrian pose completion framework termed Separation and Dimensionality Reduction-based Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (SDR-GAIN). Unlike previous approaches that train visual models to distinguish occlusion patterns, SDR-GAIN aims to learn human pose directly from the numerical distribution of keypoint coordinates and interpolate missing positions. It employs a self-supervised adversarial learning paradigm to train lightweight generators with residual structures for the imputation of missing pose keypoints. Additionally, it integrates multiple pose standardization techniques to alleviate the difficulty of the learning process. Experiments conducted on the COCO and JAAD datasets demonstrate that SDR-GAIN surpasses conventional machine learning and Transformer-based missing data interpolation algorithms in accurately recovering occluded pedestrian keypoints, while simultaneously achieving microsecond-level real-time inference.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains.

Existing methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions. The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average precision without shape priors.

SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to model. Traditional SELD architectures rely on multichannel input, which limits their ability to leverage large-scale pre-training due to data constraints. To address this, we enhance standard SELD architectures with semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion, which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. Additionally, we incorporate autocorrelation-based acoustic features to improve distance estimation. We pre-train our models on curated synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets and apply a left-right channel swapping augmentation to further increase the training data. Both our audio-only and audio-visual systems substantially outperform the challenge baselines on the development set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy. Performance is further improved through model ensembling and a visual post-processing step based on human keypoints. Future work will investigate the contribution of each modality and explore architectural variants to further enhance results.</p></details> |  | None |

This is achieved by transforming discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i) spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.</p></details> |  | None |

For example, during mouse cranial window creation, a circular path with a radius of 2 to 4 mm needs to be milled on the mouse skull using a microdrill. The uneven surface and non-uniform thickness of the mouse skull make it difficult to fully automate this process, requiring the system to possess advanced perceptual and adaptive capabilities. In this study, we address this challenge by integrating a Microscopic Stereo Camera System (MSCS) into the robotic bone micro-milling system and proposing a novel pre-measurement pipeline for the target surface. Starting from uncalibrated cameras, the pipeline enables automatic calibration and 3D surface fitting through a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based keypoint detection. Combined with the existing feedback-based system, we develop the world's first autonomous robotic bone micro-milling system capable of rapidly, in real-time, and accurately perceiving and adapting to surface unevenness and non-uniform thickness, thereby enabling an end-to-end autonomous cranial window creation workflow without human assistance. Validation experiments on euthanized mice demonstrate that the improved system achieves a success rate of 85.7% and an average milling time of 2.1 minutes, showing not only significant performance improvements over the previous system but also exceptional accuracy, speed, and stability compared to human operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> | None |

It uses lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on Bird's Eye View (BEV) image-like representations of LiDAR data to achieve accurate global localization through place recognition, followed by 3-DoF pose estimation. Our detailed analyses reveal an interesting fact that CNNs are inherently effective at extracting distinctive features from LiDAR BEV images. Remarkably, keypoints of two BEV images with large translations can be effectively matched using CNN-extracted features. Building on this insight, we design a Rotation Equivariant Module (REM) to obtain distinctive features while enhancing robustness to rotational changes. A Rotation Equivariant and Invariant Network (REIN) is then developed by cascading REM and a descriptor generator, NetVLAD, to sequentially generate rotation equivariant local features and rotation invariant global descriptors. The global descriptors are used first to achieve robust place recognition, and then local features are used for accurate pose estimation. \revise{Experimental results on seven public datasets and our UGV platform demonstrate that BEVPlace++, even when trained on a small dataset (3000 frames of KITTI) only with place labels, generalizes well to unseen environments, performs consistently across different days and years, and adapts to various types of LiDAR scanners.} BEVPlace++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple tasks, including place recognition, loop closure detection, and global localization.

Accurate assessment of bone loss severity and pattern is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based deep learning framework to automatically detect and quantify alveolar bone loss and its patterns using intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Our method combines YOLOv8 for tooth detection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify anatomical landmarks, enabling precise calculation of bone loss severity. Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models segment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal vs. angular) via geometric analysis. Evaluated on a large, expertly annotated dataset of 1000 radiographs, our approach achieved high accuracy in detecting bone loss severity (intra-class correlation coefficient up to 0.80) and bone loss pattern classification (accuracy 87%). This automated system offers a rapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing reliance on subjective manual evaluation. By integrating AI into dental radiographic analysis, our framework has the potential to improve early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for periodontitis, ultimately enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is 17 pages with 5 tables and 12 figures.

While several 3D reconstruction and depth completion approaches address these challenges, they suffer from setup complexity or limited observation information utilization. To address this, leveraging the power of single view 3D object reconstruction approaches, we propose a training free framework SR3D that enables robotic grasping of transparent and specular objects from a single view observation. Specifically, given single view RGB and depth images, SR3D first uses the external visual models to generate 3D reconstructed object mesh based on RGB image. Then, the key idea is to determine the 3D object's pose and scale to accurately localize the reconstructed object back into its original depth corrupted 3D scene. Therefore, we propose view matching and keypoint matching mechanisms,which leverage both the 2D and 3D's inherent semantic and geometric information in the observation to determine the object's 3D state within the scene, thereby reconstructing an accurate 3D depth map for effective grasp detection. Experiments in both simulation and real world show the reconstruction effectiveness of SR3D.</p></details> |  | None |

Although recent deep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated datasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling high-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world settings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations and semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task learning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically optimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate auxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text detection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a convolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net, and hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic weight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of each loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon the SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for single-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and real-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach improves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while preserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap between simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task: SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed. Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time, that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly derived from a single-view SAR image.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures | None |

Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects. Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation.

In 3D HPE, occlusions, where parts of the body are not visible in the image, pose a significant challenge for accurate pose reconstruction. This paper presents a benchmark on the robustness of 3D HPE models under realistic occlusion conditions, involving combinations of occluded keypoints commonly observed in real-world scenarios. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D HPE models, spanning convolutional, transformer-based, graph-based, and diffusion-based architectures, using the BlendMimic3D dataset, a synthetic dataset with ground-truth 2D/3D annotations and occlusion labels. All models were originally trained on Human3.6M and tested here without retraining to assess their generalization. We introduce a protocol that simulates occlusion by adding noise into 2D keypoints based on real detector behavior, and conduct both global and per-joint sensitivity analyses. Our findings reveal that all models exhibit notable performance degradation under occlusion, with diffusion-based models underperforming despite their stochastic nature. Additionally, a per-joint occlusion analysis identifies consistent vulnerability in distal joints (e.g., wrists, feet) across models. Overall, this work highlights critical limitations of current 3D HPE models in handling occlusions, and provides insights for improving real-world robustness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Good Keypoints for the Two-View Geometry Estimation Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18767v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local features are essential to many modern downstream applications. Therefore, it is of interest to determine the properties of local features that contribute to the downstream performance for a better design of feature detectors and descriptors. In our work, we propose a new theoretical model for scoring feature points (keypoints) in the context of the two-view geometry estimation problem. The model determines two properties that a good keypoint for solving the homography estimation problem should have: be repeatable and have a small expected measurement error. This result provides key insights into why maximizing the number of correspondences doesn't always lead to better homography estimation accuracy. We use the developed model to design a method that detects keypoints that benefit the homography estimation and introduce the Bounded NeSS-ST (BoNeSS-ST) keypoint detector. The novelty of BoNeSS-ST comes from strong theoretical foundations, a more accurate keypoint scoring due to subpixel refinement and a cost designed for superior robustness to low saliency keypoints. As a result, BoNeSS-ST outperforms prior self-supervised local feature detectors on the planar homography estimation task and is on par with them on the epipolar geometry estimation task.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

While existing 3D object detection approaches operate globally and implicitly rely on the a priori existence of metric camera poses, our method, Rooms from Motion (RfM) operates on a collection of un-posed images. By replacing the standard 2D keypoint-based matcher of structure-from-motion with an object-centric matcher based on image-derived 3D boxes, we estimate metric camera poses, object tracks, and finally produce a global, semantic 3D object map. When a priori pose is available, we can significantly improve map quality through optimization of global 3D boxes against individual observations. RfM shows strong localization performance and subsequently produces maps of higher quality than leading point-based and multi-view 3D object detection methods on CA-1M and ScanNet++, despite these global methods relying on overparameterization through point clouds or dense volumes. Rooms from Motion achieves a general, object-centric representation which not only extends the work of Cubify Anything to full scenes but also allows for inherently sparse localization and parametric mapping proportional to the number of objects in a scene.</p></details> |  | None |

The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW applied to the full signals.

| **[Visual Loop Closure Detection Through Deep Graph Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21754v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual loop closure detection traditionally relies on place recognition methods to retrieve candidate loops that are validated using computationally expensive RANSAC-based geometric verification. As false positive loop closures significantly degrade downstream pose graph estimates, verifying a large number of candidates in online simultaneous localization and mapping scenarios is constrained by limited time and compute resources. While most deep loop closure detection approaches only operate on pairs of keyframes, we relax this constraint by considering neighborhoods of multiple keyframes when detecting loops. In this work, we introduce LoopGNN, a graph neural network architecture that estimates loop closure consensus by leveraging cliques of visually similar keyframes retrieved through place recognition. By propagating deep feature encodings among nodes of the clique, our method yields high-precision estimates while maintaining high recall. Extensive experimental evaluations on the TartanDrive 2.0 and NCLT datasets demonstrate that LoopGNN outperforms traditional baselines. Additionally, an ablation study across various keypoint extractors demonstrates that our method is robust, regardless of the type of deep feature encodings used, and exhibits higher computational efficiency compared to classical geometric verification baselines. We release our code, supplementary material, and keyframe data at https://loopgnn.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the models pre-trained on such data can be suboptimal for robot learning due to the significant visual gap between human hands and those of different robots. To remedy this, we propose H2R, a simple data augmentation technique that detects human hand keypoints, synthesizes robot motions in simulation, and composites rendered robots into egocentric videos. This process explicitly bridges the visual gap between human and robot embodiments during pre-training. We apply H2R to augment large-scale egocentric human video datasets such as Ego4D and SSv2, replacing human hands with simulated robotic arms to generate robot-centric training data. Based on this, we construct and release a family of 1M-scale datasets covering multiple robot embodiments (UR5 with gripper/Leaphand, Franka) and data sources (SSv2, Ego4D). To verify the effectiveness of the augmentation pipeline, we introduce a CLIP-based image-text similarity metric that quantitatively evaluates the semantic fidelity of robot-rendered frames to the original human actions. We validate H2R across three simulation benchmarks: Robomimic, RLBench and PushT and real-world manipulation tasks with a UR5 robot equipped with Gripper and Leaphand end-effectors. H2R consistently improves downstream success rates, yielding gains of 5.0%-10.2% in simulation and 6.7%-23.3% in real-world tasks across various visual encoders and policy learning methods. These results indicate that H2R improves the generalization ability of robotic policies by mitigating the visual discrepancies between human and robot domains.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods for document alignment rely on image-based features like keypoints, edges, and textures to estimate geometric transformations, such as homographies. However, these approaches often require access to the original document images, which may not always be available due to privacy, storage, or transmission constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) outputs as features for homography estimation. By utilizing the spatial positions and textual content of OCR-detected words, our method enables document alignment without relying on pixel-level image data. This technique is particularly valuable in scenarios where only OCR outputs are accessible. Furthermore, the method is robust to OCR noise, incorporating RANSAC to handle outliers and inaccuracies in the OCR data. On a set of test documents, we demonstrate that our OCR-based approach even performs more accurately than traditional image-based methods, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for document registration tasks. The proposed method facilitates applications in document processing, all while reducing reliance on high-dimensional image data.</p></details> |  | None |

Sustaining Long-Term Visual Localization via Handcrafted-Learned Feature Collaboration on CPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18652v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust long-term visual localization in complex industrial environments is critical for mobile robotic systems. Existing approaches face limitations: handcrafted features are illumination-sensitive, learned features are computationally intensive, and semantic- or marker-based methods are environmentally constrained. Handcrafted and learned features share similar representations but differ functionally. Handcrafted features are optimized for continuous tracking, while learned features excel in wide-baseline matching. Their complementarity calls for integration rather than replacement. Building on this, we propose a hierarchical localization framework. It leverages real-time handcrafted feature extraction for relative pose estimation. In parallel, it employs selective learned keypoint detection on optimized keyframes for absolute positioning. This design enables CPU-efficient, long-term visual localization. Experiments systematically progress through three validation phases: Initially establishing feature complementarity through comparative analysis, followed by computational latency profiling across algorithm stages on CPU platforms. Final evaluation under photometric variations (including seasonal transitions and diurnal cycles) demonstrates 47% average error reduction with significantly improved localization consistency.

Recently, bird's-eye view (BEV)-based perception approaches have emerged as superior alternatives to perspective-based solutions, offering enhanced spatial understanding and more natural outputs for planning. Existing BEV-based 3D object detection methods, typically adhering to angle-based representation, directly estimate the size and orientation of rotated bounding boxes. We observe that BEV-based 3D object detection is analogous to aerial oriented object detection, where angle-based methods are recognized for being affected by discontinuities in their loss functions. Drawing inspiration from this domain, we propose Restricted Quadrilateral Representation to define 3D regression targets. RQR3D regresses the smallest horizontal bounding box encapsulating the oriented box, along with the offsets between the corners of these two boxes, thereby transforming the oriented object detection problem into a keypoint regression task. RQR3D is compatible with any 3D object detection approach. We employ RQR3D within an anchor-free single-stage object detection method and introduce an objectness head to address class imbalance problem. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified radar fusion backbone that eliminates the need for voxel grouping and processes the BEV-mapped point cloud with standard 2D convolutions, rather than sparse convolutions. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that RQR3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera-radar 3D object detection, outperforming the previous best method by +4% in NDS and +2.4% in mAP, and significantly reducing the translation and orientation errors, which are crucial for safe autonomous driving. These consistent gains highlight the robustness, precision, and real-world readiness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Furthermore, we explore the application of keypoint-based 2D pose-estimation models for detecting hold usage in sport climbing. We determine usage by analyzing the key points of certain joints and the corresponding overlap with climbing holds. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models and analyze their accuracy on our dataset, identifying and highlighting climbing-specific challenges. Our dataset and results highlight key challenges in climbing-specific pose estimation and establish a foundation for future research toward AI-assisted systems for sports climbing.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at the International Workshop on Computer Vision in Sports (CVsports) at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, recent advances in online scene understanding still face limitations, especially in long-range or occluded scenarios, due to the inherent constraints of onboard sensors. To address this challenge, we propose a Standard-Definition (SD) Map Enhanced scene Perception and Topology reasoning (SEPT) framework, which explores how to effectively incorporate the SD map as prior knowledge into existing perception and reasoning pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a novel hybrid feature fusion strategy that combines SD maps with Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, considering both rasterized and vectorized representations, while mitigating potential misalignment between SD maps and BEV feature spaces. Additionally, we leverage the SD map characteristics to design an auxiliary intersection-aware keypoint detection task, which further enhances the overall scene understanding performance. Experimental results on the large-scale OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate that by effectively integrating SD map priors, our framework significantly improves both scene perception and topology reasoning, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> | None |

State-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance.

Generalization needs to take into account the high-level structural differences between distinct objects while still maintaining similar low-level interaction control. In this paper, we propose an example-based zero-shot approach to skill transfer. Rather than treating skills as atomic, we decompose skills into a prioritized list of grounded task-axis (GTA) controllers. Each GTAC defines an adaptable controller, such as a position or force controller, along an axis. Importantly, the GTACs are grounded in object key points and axes, e.g., the relative position of a screw head or the axis of its shaft. Zero-shot transfer is thus achieved by finding semantically-similar grounding features on novel target objects. We achieve this example-based grounding of the skills through the use of foundation models, such as SD-DINO, that can detect semantically similar keypoints of objects. We evaluate our framework on real-robot experiments, including screwing, pouring, and spatula scraping tasks, and demonstrate robust and versatile controller transfer for each.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current SCR methods often face challenges in handling repetitive textures and meaningless areas due to their reliance on implicit triangulation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate SCR system. Compared to existing SCR methods, we propose a unified architecture for both scene encoding and salient keypoint detection, allowing our system to prioritize the encoding of informative regions. This design significantly improves computational efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a mechanism that utilizes sequential information during both mapping and relocalization. The proposed method enhances the implicit triangulation, especially in environments with repetitive textures. Comprehensive experiments conducted across indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SCR methods. Our single-frame relocalization mode improves the recall rate of our baseline by 6.4% and increases the running speed from 56Hz to 90Hz. Furthermore, our sequence-based mode increases the recall rate by 11% while maintaining the original efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

While recent works have identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer, which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.</p></details> |  | None |

Ergonomic assessments can mitigate these risks by identifying workplace adjustments that improve posture and reduce strain. Camera-based systems offer a non-intrusive, cost-effective method for continuous ergonomic tracking, but they also raise significant privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a privacy-aware ergonomic assessment framework utilizing machine learning techniques. Our approach employs adversarial training to develop a lightweight neural network that obfuscates video data, preserving only the essential information needed for human pose estimation. This obfuscation ensures compatibility with standard pose estimation algorithms, maintaining high accuracy while protecting privacy. The obfuscated video data is transmitted to a central server, where state-of-the-art keypoint detection algorithms extract body landmarks. Using multi-view integration, 3D keypoints are reconstructed and evaluated with the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method. Our system provides a secure, effective solution for ergonomic monitoring in industrial environments, addressing both privacy and workplace safety concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 35th CIRP Design conference</p></details> | None |

Many approaches have emerged for editing images derived from vectors in the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN/2 models by identifying semantically meaningful directions (e.g., gender or age) in the latent space. By moving the vector in a specific direction, the ideal result would only change the target feature while preserving all the other features. Providing an ideal data augmentation approach for gesture research as it could be used to generate numerous image variations whilst keeping the facial expressions intact. However, entanglement issues, where changing one feature inevitably affects other features, impacts the ability to preserve facial expressions. To address this, we propose the use of an addition to the loss function of a Facial Keypoint Detection model to restrict changes to the facial expressions. Building on top of an existing model, adding the proposed Human Face Landmark Detection (HFLD) loss, provided by a pre-trained Facial Keypoint Detection model, to the original loss function. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the existing and our extended model, showing the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the entanglement issue and maintaining the facial expression. Our approach achieves up to 49% reduction in the change of emotion in our experiments. Moreover, we show the benefit of our approach by comparing with state-of-the-art models. By increasing the ability to preserve the facial gesture and expression during facial transformation, we present a way to create human face images with fixed expression but different appearances, making it a reliable data augmentation approach for Facial Gesture and Expression research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2nd International Workshop on Synthetic Data for Face and Gesture Analysis at IEEE FG 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing registration methods for color fundus images typically rely on keypoints and descriptors for alignment; however, a significant limitation is their reliance on labeled data, which is particularly scarce in the medical domain. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised registration pipeline that entirely eliminates the need for labeled data. Our approach is based on the principle that locations with distinctive descriptors constitute reliable keypoints. This fully inverts the conventional state-of-the-art approach, conditioning the detector on the descriptor rather than the opposite. First, we propose an innovative descriptor learning method that operates without keypoint detection or any labels, generating descriptors for arbitrary locations in retinal images. Next, we introduce a novel, label-free keypoint detector network which works by estimating descriptor performance directly from the input image. We validate our method through a comprehensive evaluation on four hold-out datasets, demonstrating that our unsupervised descriptor outperforms state-of-the-art supervised descriptors and that our unsupervised detector significantly outperforms existing unsupervised detection methods. Finally, our full registration pipeline achieves performance comparable to the leading supervised methods, while not employing any labeled data.

These images enable the application of deep learning (DL) approaches, originally developed for RGB images from cameras to lidar-only systems, eliminating other efforts, such as lidar-camera calibration.

To analyze the behavior of the topological graph, we employ an improved Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the general dynamics. The GNN model can predict the deformation of clothing and is employed to calculate the deformation Jacobi matrix for control.

While deep learning approaches have significantly improved performance, they often incur substantial computational costs, limiting their deployment in real-time edge applications. Efforts to create lightweight neural networks have seen some success, yet they often result in trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy.

Increasingly, robust multimodal matching has garnered interest in robotics, surveillance, remote sensing, and medical imaging. While traditional rely on detecting and matching spatial features, they break down when faced with noisy, misaligned, or cross-modal data. Recent deep learning methods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain constrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational demands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves beyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively. Instead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion signatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal motion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve natural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while remaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also requires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature detection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it outperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional approaches fail. By leveraging motion rather than appearance, Flow Intelligence enables robust, real-time video feature matching in diverse environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Results: The system demonstrated superior consistency in angle measurements compared to a cohort of eight moderately experienced orthopedists. The intraclass correlation coefficients for the CE, Tonnis, and Sharp angles were 0.957 (95% CI: 0.952--0.962), 0.942 (95% CI: 0.937--0.947), and 0.966 (95% CI: 0.964--0.968), respectively. The system achieved a diagnostic F1 score of 0.863 (95% CI: 0.851--0.876), significantly outperforming the orthopedist group (0.777, 95% CI: 0.737--0.817, p = 0.005), as well as using clinical diagnostic criteria for each angle individually (p<0.001). Conclusion: The proposed system provides reliable and consistent automated measurements of radiological angles and an explainable diagnostic output for DDH, outperforming moderately experienced clinicians. Clinical impact: This AI-powered solution reduces the variability and potential errors of manual measurements, offering clinicians a more consistent and interpretable tool for DDH diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stereophotoclinometry Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08252v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based surface reconstruction and characterization is crucial for missions to small celestial bodies, as it informs mission planning, navigation, and scientific analysis. However, current state-of-the-practice methods, such as stereophotoclinometry (SPC), rely heavily on human-in-the-loop verification and high-fidelity a priori information. This paper proposes Photoclinometry-from-Motion (PhoMo), a novel framework that incorporates photoclinometry techniques into a keypoint-based structure-from-motion (SfM) system to estimate the surface normal and albedo at detected landmarks to improve autonomous surface and shape characterization of small celestial bodies from in-situ imagery. In contrast to SPC, we forego the expensive maplet estimation step and instead use dense keypoint measurements and correspondences from an autonomous keypoint detection and matching method based on deep learning. Moreover, we develop a factor graph-based approach allowing for simultaneous optimization of the spacecraft's pose, landmark positions, Sun-relative direction, and surface normals and albedos via fusion of Sun vector measurements and image keypoint measurements. The proposed framework is validated on real imagery taken by the Dawn mission to the asteroid 4 Vesta and the minor planet 1 Ceres and compared against an SPC reconstruction, where we demonstrate superior rendering performance compared to an SPC solution and precise alignment to a stereophotogrammetry (SPG) solution without relying on any a priori camera pose and topography information or humans-in-the-loop.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2312.06865</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Efficient Real-Time Video Motion Transfer via Generative Time Series Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05537v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a deep learning framework designed to significantly optimize bandwidth for motion-transfer-enabled video applications, including video conferencing, virtual reality interactions, health monitoring systems, and vision-based real-time anomaly detection. To capture complex motion effectively, we utilize the First Order Motion Model (FOMM), which encodes dynamic objects by detecting keypoints and their associated local affine transformations. These keypoints are identified using a self-supervised keypoint detector and arranged into a time series corresponding to the successive frames. Forecasting is performed on these keypoints by integrating two advanced generative time series models into the motion transfer pipeline, namely the Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) and the Gated Recurrent Unit with Normalizing Flow (GRU-NF). The predicted keypoints are subsequently synthesized into realistic video frames using an optical flow estimator paired with a generator network, thereby facilitating accurate video forecasting and enabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. We validate our results across three datasets for video animation and reconstruction using the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture Embedding Distance, Structural Similarity Index, and Average Pair-wise Displacement. Our results confirm that by utilizing the superior reconstruction property of the Variational Autoencoder, the VRNN integrated FOMM excels in applications involving multi-step ahead forecasts such as video conferencing. On the other hand, by leveraging the Normalizing Flow architecture for exact likelihood estimation, and enabling efficient latent space sampling, the GRU-NF based FOMM exhibits superior capabilities for producing diverse future samples while maintaining high visual quality for tasks like real-time video-based anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A novel gesture interaction control method for rehabilitation lower extremity exoskeleton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01888v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Rehabilitation Lower Extremity Robotic Exoskeletons (RLEEX) technology, significant advancements have been made in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) methods. These include traditional physical HRI methods that are easily recognizable and various bio-electrical signal-based HRI methods that can visualize and predict actions. However, most of these HRI methods are contact-based, facing challenges such as operational complexity, sensitivity to interference, risks associated with implantable devices, and, most importantly, limitations in comfort. These challenges render the interaction less intuitive and natural, which can negatively impact patient motivation for rehabilitation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel non-contact gesture interaction control method for RLEEX, based on RGB monocular camera depth estimation. This method integrates three key steps: detecting keypoints, recognizing gestures, and assessing distance, thereby applying gesture information and augmented reality triggering technology to control gait movements of RLEEX. Results indicate that this approach provides a feasible solution to the problems of poor comfort, low reliability, and high latency in HRI for RLEEX platforms. Specifically, it achieves a gesture-controlled exoskeleton motion accuracy of 94.11\% and an average system response time of 0.615 seconds through non-contact HRI. The proposed non-contact HRI method represents a pioneering advancement in control interactions for RLEEX, paving the way for further exploration and development in this field.</p></details> |  | None |

Considering the extensive variation in lane structures worldwide, achieving high generalization capacity is particularly challenging, as algorithms must accurately identify a wide variety of lane patterns worldwide. Traditional top-down approaches rely heavily on learning lane characteristics from training datasets, often struggling with lanes exhibiting previously unseen attributes. To address this generalization limitation, we propose a method that detects keypoints of lanes and subsequently predicts sequential connections between them to construct complete 3D lanes. Each key point is essential for maintaining lane continuity, and we predict multiple proposals per keypoint by allowing adjacent grids to predict the same keypoint using an offset mechanism. PointNMS is employed to eliminate overlapping proposal keypoints, reducing redundancy in the estimated BEV graph and minimizing computational overhead from connection estimations. Our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on both the Apollo and OpenLane datasets, demonstrating superior F1 scores and a strong generalization capacity when models trained on OpenLane are evaluated on the Apollo dataset, compared to prior approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths. Integration of YOLO11 and Depth Anything Model provides a promising solution to 3D pose estimation of immature green fruits for robotic thinning applications.

A monocular RGB camera mounted on the platform is utilized to collect the visual data. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then employed to extract the features serving as the visual data for the servoing task. This paper contributes to the field by circumventing not only the challenge stemming from the need for man-made marker detection in conventional visual servoing techniques, but also enhancing the robustness against undesirable factors including occlusion, varying illumination, clutter, and background changes, thereby broadening the applicability of perception-guided motion control tasks in aerial robots.

| **[RatBodyFormer: Rat Body Surface from Keypoints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09599v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing rat behavior lies at the heart of many scientific studies. Past methods for automated rodent modeling have focused on 3D pose estimation from keypoints, e.g., face and appendages. The pose, however, does not capture the rich body surface movement encoding the subtle rat behaviors like curling and stretching. The body surface lacks features that can be visually defined, evading these established keypoint-based methods. In this paper, we introduce the first method for reconstructing the rat body surface as a dense set of points by learning to predict it from the sparse keypoints that can be detected with past methods. Our method consists of two key contributions. The first is RatDome, a novel multi-camera system for rat behavior capture, and a large-scale dataset captured with it that consists of pairs of 3D keypoints and 3D body surface points. The second is RatBodyFormer, a novel network to transform detected keypoints to 3D body surface points. RatBodyFormer is agnostic to the exact locations of the 3D body surface points in the training data and is trained with masked-learning. We experimentally validate our framework with a number of real-world experiments. Our results collectively serve as a novel foundation for automated rat behavior analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://vision.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/research/ratbodyformer/</p></details> | None |
| **[Incremental Object Keypoint Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20248v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing progress in object keypoint estimation primarily benefits from the conventional supervised learning paradigm based on numerous data labeled with pre-defined keypoints. However, these well-trained models can hardly detect the undefined new keypoints in test time, which largely hinders their feasibility for diverse downstream tasks. To handle this, various solutions are explored but still suffer from either limited generalizability or transferability. Therefore, in this paper, we explore a novel keypoint learning paradigm in that we only annotate new keypoints in the new data and incrementally train the model, without retaining any old data, called Incremental object Keypoint Learning (IKL). A two-stage learning scheme as a novel baseline tailored to IKL is developed. In the first Knowledge Association stage, given the data labeled with only new keypoints, an auxiliary KA-Net is trained to automatically associate the old keypoints to these new ones based on their spatial and intrinsic anatomical relations. In the second Mutual Promotion stage, based on a keypoint-oriented spatial distillation loss, we jointly leverage the auxiliary KA-Net and the old model for knowledge consolidation to mutually promote the estimation of all old and new keypoints. Owing to the investigation of the correlations between new and old keypoints, our proposed method can not just effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of old keypoints, but may even further improve the estimation of the old ones and achieve a positive transfer beyond anti-forgetting. Such an observation has been solidly verified by extensive experiments on different keypoint datasets, where our method exhibits superiority in alleviating the forgetting issue and boosting performance while enjoying labeling efficiency even under the low-shot data regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a Multiscale Feature Importance-based Bit Allocation (MFIBA) for end-to-end FCM. First, we find that the importance of features for machine vision tasks varies with the scales, object size, and image instances. Based on this finding, we propose a Multiscale Feature Importance Prediction (MFIP) module to predict the importance weight for each scale of features. Secondly, we propose a task loss-rate model to establish the relationship between the task accuracy losses of using compressed features and the bitrate of encoding these features. Finally, we develop a MFIBA for end-to-end FCM, which is able to assign coding bits of multiscale features more reasonably based on their importance. Experimental results demonstrate that when combined with a retained Efficient Learned Image Compression (ELIC), the proposed MFIBA achieves an average of 38.202% bitrate savings in object detection compared to the anchor ELIC. Moreover, the proposed MFIBA achieves an average of 17.212% and 36.492% feature bitrate savings for instance segmentation and keypoint detection, respectively. When the proposed MFIBA is applied to the LIC-TCM, it achieves an average of 18.103%, 19.866% and 19.597% bit rate savings on three machine vision tasks, respectively, which validates the proposed MFIBA has good generalizability and adaptability to different machine vision tasks and FCM base codecs.</p></details> |  | None |

In our work, we address both of these issues by utilizing a combination of a hand-crafted Shi-Tomasi detector, a specially designed metric that assesses the quality of keypoints, the stability score (SS), and a neural network. We build on the principled and localized keypoints provided by the Shi-Tomasi detector and learn the neural network to select good feature points via the stability score. The neural network incorporates the knowledge from the training targets in the form of the neural stability score (NeSS). Therefore, our method is named NeSS-ST since it combines the Shi-Tomasi detector and the properties of the neural stability score. It only requires sets of images for training without dataset pre-labeling or the need for reconstructed correspondence labels. We evaluate NeSS-ST on HPatches, ScanNet, MegaDepth and IMC-PT demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and good generalization on downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of ICCV 2023 paper</p></details> | None |
| **[STEP: Simultaneous Tracking and Estimation of Pose for Animals and Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13344v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce STEP, a novel framework utilizing Transformer-based discriminative model prediction for simultaneous tracking and estimation of pose across diverse animal species and humans. We are inspired by the fact that the human brain exploits spatiotemporal continuity and performs concurrent localization and pose estimation despite the specialization of brain areas for form and motion processing. Traditional discriminative models typically require predefined target states for determining model weights, a challenge we address through Gaussian Map Soft Prediction (GMSP) and Offset Map Regression Adapter (OMRA) Modules. These modules remove the necessity of keypoint target states as input, streamlining the process. Our method starts with a known target state in the initial frame of a given video sequence. It then seamlessly tracks the target and estimates keypoints of anatomical importance as output for subsequent frames. Unlike prevalent top-down pose estimation methods, our approach doesn't rely on per-frame target detections due to its tracking capability. This facilitates a significant advancement in inference efficiency and potential applications. We train and validate our approach on datasets encompassing diverse species. Our experiments demonstrate superior results compared to existing methods, opening doors to various applications, including but not limited to action recognition and behavioral analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HandOS: 3D Hand Reconstruction in One Stage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01537v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches of hand reconstruction predominantly adhere to a multi-stage framework, encompassing detection, left-right classification, and pose estimation. This paradigm induces redundant computation and cumulative errors. In this work, we propose HandOS, an end-to-end framework for 3D hand reconstruction. Our central motivation lies in leveraging a frozen detector as the foundation while incorporating auxiliary modules for 2D and 3D keypoint estimation. In this manner, we integrate the pose estimation capacity into the detection framework, while at the same time obviating the necessity of using the left-right category as a prerequisite. Specifically, we propose an interactive 2D-3D decoder, where 2D joint semantics is derived from detection cues while 3D representation is lifted from those of 2D joints. Furthermore, hierarchical attention is designed to enable the concurrent modeling of 2D joints, 3D vertices, and camera translation. Consequently, we achieve an end-to-end integration of hand detection, 2D pose estimation, and 3D mesh reconstruction within a one-stage framework, so that the above multi-stage drawbacks are overcome. Meanwhile, the HandOS reaches state-of-the-art performances on public benchmarks, e.g., 5.0 PA-MPJPE on FreiHand and 64.6\% PCK@0.05 on HInt-Ego4D.

| **[Point Cloud Structural Similarity-based Underwater Sonar Loop Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14020v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this letter, we propose a point cloud structural similarity-based loop detection method for underwater Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using sonar sensors. Existing sonar-based loop detection approaches often rely on 2D projection and keypoint extraction, which can lead to data loss and poor performance in feature-scarce environments. Additionally, methods based on neural networks or Bag-of-Words require extensive preprocessing, such as model training or vocabulary creation, reducing adaptability to new environments. To address these challenges, our method directly utilizes 3D sonar point clouds without projection and computes point-wise structural feature maps based on geometry, normals, and curvature. By leveraging rotation-invariant similarity comparisons, the proposed approach eliminates the need for keypoint detection and ensures robust loop detection across diverse underwater terrains. We validate our method using two real-world datasets: the Antarctica dataset obtained from deep underwater and the Seaward dataset collected from rivers and lakes. Experimental results show that our method achieves the highest loop detection performance compared to existing keypointbased and learning-based approaches while requiring no additional training or preprocessing.

Replacing human observers by computer vision lowers the cost of data collection and therefore allows to collect more extensive datasets. However, the majority of available computer vision algorithms to study animal behaviour is highly tailored towards a single research objective, limiting possibilities for data reuse. In this perspective, pose-estimation in combination with animal tracking offers opportunities to yield a higher level representation capturing both the spatial and temporal component of animal behaviour. Such a higher level representation allows to answer a wide variety of research questions simultaneously, without the need to develop repeatedly tailored computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we therefore first cope with several weaknesses of current pose-estimation algorithms and thereafter introduce KeySORT (Keypoint Simple and Online Realtime Tracking). KeySORT deploys an adaptive Kalman filter to construct tracklets in a bounding-box free manner, significantly improving the temporal consistency of detected keypoints. In this paper, we focus on pose estimation in cattle, but our methodology can easily be generalised to any other animal species. Our test results indicate our algorithm is able to detect up to 80% of the ground truth keypoints with high accuracy, with only a limited drop in performance when daylight recordings are compared to nightvision recordings. Moreover, by using KeySORT to construct skeletons, the temporal consistency of generated keypoint coordinates was largely improved, offering opportunities with regard to automated behaviour monitoring of animals.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing methods predominantly operate on RGB images, we propose a novel network that directly processes raw images, bypassing the need for the Image Signal Processor (ISP). This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations.

| **[DaD: Distilled Reinforcement Learning for Diverse Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07347v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keypoints are what enable Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems to scale to thousands of images. However, designing a keypoint detection objective is a non-trivial task, as SfM is non-differentiable. Typically, an auxiliary objective involving a descriptor is optimized. This however induces a dependency on the descriptor, which is undesirable. In this paper we propose a fully self-supervised and descriptor-free objective for keypoint detection, through reinforcement learning. To ensure training does not degenerate, we leverage a balanced top-K sampling strategy. While this already produces competitive models, we find that two qualitatively different types of detectors emerge, which are only able to detect light and dark keypoints respectively. To remedy this, we train a third detector, DaD, that optimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the pointwise maximum of both light and dark detectors. Our approach significantly improve upon SotA across a range of benchmarks.

However, dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and keypoint detection, pose significant challenges for MLLMs when represented solely as text outputs. Simultaneously, current MLLMs utilizing latent embeddings for visual task decoding generally demonstrate limited adaptability to both multi-task learning and multi-granularity scenarios. In this work, we present REF-VLM, an end-to-end framework for unified training of various visual decoding tasks. To address complex visual decoding scenarios, we introduce the Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm (TRP), which explicitly decouples three critical dimensions in visual decoding tasks through a triplet structure: concepts, decoding types, and targets. TRP employs symbolic delimiters to enforce structured representation learning, enhancing the parsability and interpretability of model outputs. Additionally, we construct Visual-Task Instruction Following Dataset (VTInstruct), a large-scale multi-task dataset containing over 100 million multimodal dialogue samples across 25 task types. Beyond text inputs and outputs, VT-Instruct incorporates various visual prompts such as point, box, scribble, and mask, and generates outputs composed of text and visual units like box, keypoint, depth and mask. The combination of different visual prompts and visual units generates a wide variety of task types, expanding the applicability of REF-VLM significantly. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our REF-VLM outperforms other MLLMs across a variety of standard benchmarks.

Among these methods, a recent subclass of approaches based on unsupervised keypoint detection stand out as very promising for interpretability. Specifically, these methods train a network to predict feature maps for fixed and moving images, from which explainable centres of mass are computed to obtain point clouds, that are then aligned in closed-form. However, the features returned by the network often yield spatially diffuse patterns that are hard to interpret, thus undermining the purpose of keypoint-based registration. Here, we propose a three-fold loss to regularise the spatial distribution of the features. First, we use the KL divergence to model features as point spread functions that we interpret as probabilistic keypoints. Then, we sharpen the spatial distributions of these features to increase the precision of the detected landmarks. Finally, we introduce a new repulsive loss across keypoints to encourage spatial diversity. Overall, our loss considerably improves the interpretability of the features, which now correspond to precise and anatomically meaningful landmarks. We demonstrate our three-fold loss in foetal rigid motion tracking and brain MRI affine registration tasks, where it not only outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised strategies, but also bridges the gap with state-of-the-art supervised methods.

This study evaluates the application of a deep learning keypoint and object detection model, YOLOv8-pose, for the automatic identification of localised periodontal bone loss landmarks, conditions and staging. YOLOv8-pose was fine-tuned on 193 annotated periapical radiographs. We propose a keypoint detection metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), which normalises the metric to the average tooth size of teeth in the image. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that adjusts certain keypoint predictions to align with the edge of the related tooth, using a supporting instance segmentation model trained on an open source auxiliary dataset. The model can sufficiently detect bone loss keypoints, tooth boxes, and alveolar ridge resorption, but has insufficient performance at detecting detached periodontal ligament and furcation involvement. The model with post-processing demonstrated a PRCK 0.25 of 0.726 and PRCK 0.05 of 0.401 for keypoint detection, mAP 0.5 of 0.715 for tooth object detection, mesial dice score of 0.593 for periodontal staging, and dice score of 0.280 for furcation involvement. Our annotation methodology provides a stage agnostic approach to periodontal disease detection, by ensuring most keypoints are present for each tooth in the image, allowing small imbalanced datasets. Our PRCK metric allows accurate evaluation of keypoints in dental domains.

| **[Night-Voyager: Consistent and Efficient Nocturnal Vision-Aided State Estimation in Object Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20054v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust state estimation at nighttime is essential for autonomous robotic navigation to achieve nocturnal or round-the-clock tasks. An intuitive question arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state estimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse illumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A pivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as stable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep space aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we propose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation framework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile localization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual methods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level metrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves as a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective propagation and utilization of object map information within the system. Night-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global localization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data association, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using map-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties in visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a feature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both simulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km), Night-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a critical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[A Novel Streamline-based diffusion MRI Tractography Registration Method with Probabilistic Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02481v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Registration of diffusion MRI tractography is an essential step for analyzing group similarities and variations in the brain's white matter (WM). Streamline-based registration approaches can leverage the 3D geometric information of fiber pathways to enable spatial alignment after registration. Existing methods usually rely on the optimization of the spatial distances to identify the optimal transformation. However, such methods overlook point connectivity patterns within the streamline itself, limiting their ability to identify anatomical correspondences across tractography datasets. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised approach using deep learning to perform streamline-based dMRI tractography registration. The overall idea is to identify corresponding keypoint pairs across subjects for spatial alignment of tractography datasets. We model tractography as point clouds to leverage the graph connectivity along streamlines. We propose a novel keypoint detection method for streamlines, framed as a probabilistic classification task to identify anatomically consistent correspondences across unstructured streamline sets. In the experiments, we compare several existing methods and show highly effective and efficient tractography registration performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust Palm-Vein Recognition Using the MMD Filter: Improving SIFT-Based Feature Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01612v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge with palm vein images is that slight movements of the fingers and thumb, or variations in hand posture, can stretch the skin in different areas and alter the vein patterns. This can result in an infinite number of variations in palm vein images for a given individual. This paper introduces a novel filtering technique for SIFT-based feature matching, known as the Mean and Median Distance (MMD) Filter. This method evaluates the differences in keypoint coordinates and computes the mean and median in each direction to eliminate incorrect matches. Experiments conducted on the 850nm subset of the CASIA dataset indicate that the proposed MMD filter effectively preserves correct points while reducing false positives detected by other filtering methods. A comparison with existing SIFT-based palm vein recognition systems demonstrates that the proposed MMD filter delivers outstanding performance, achieving lower Equal Error Rate (EER) values. This article presents an extended author's version based on our previous work, A Keypoint Filtering Method for SIFT based Palm-Vein Recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our previous work, presented at the 2022 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA) and published in IEEE Xplore.

Cholecystectomy, the gallbladder removal, is particularly well-suited for automation due to its standardized procedural steps and distinct anatomical boundaries. A key challenge in automating this procedure is dissecting with accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents a vision-based autonomous robotic dissection architecture that integrates real-time segmentation, keypoint detection, grasping and stretching the gallbladder with the left arm, and dissecting with the other. We introduce an improved segmentation dataset based on videos of robotic cholecystectomy performed by various surgeons, incorporating a new ``liver bed'' class to enhance boundary tracking after multiple rounds of dissection. Our system employs state-of-the-art segmentation models and an adaptive boundary extraction method that maintains accuracy despite tissue deformations and visual variations. Moreover, we implemented an automated grasping and pulling strategy to optimize tissue tension before dissection upon our previous work. Ex vivo evaluations on porcine livers demonstrate that our framework significantly improves dissection precision and consistency, marking a step toward fully autonomous robotic cholecystectomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[CNSv2: Probabilistic Correspondence Encoded Neural Image Servo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00132v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual servo based on traditional image matching methods often requires accurate keypoint correspondence for high precision control. However, keypoint detection or matching tends to fail in challenging scenarios with inconsistent illuminations or textureless objects, resulting significant performance degradation. Previous approaches, including our proposed Correspondence encoded Neural image Servo policy (CNS), attempted to alleviate these issues by integrating neural control strategies. While CNS shows certain improvement against error correspondence over conventional image-based controllers, it could not fully resolve the limitations arising from poor keypoint detection and matching. In this paper, we continue to address this problem and propose a new solution: Probabilistic Correspondence Encoded Neural Image Servo (CNSv2). CNSv2 leverages probabilistic feature matching to improve robustness in challenging scenarios. By redesigning the architecture to condition on multimodal feature matching, CNSv2 achieves high precision, improved robustness across diverse scenes and runs in real-time. We validate CNSv2 with simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of detector-based methods in visual servo tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Our system adopts a hybrid approach that combines deep learning techniques for feature detection and matching with traditional backend optimization methods. Specifically, we propose a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) that simultaneously extracts keypoints and structural lines. These features are then associated, matched, triangulated, and optimized in a coupled manner. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight relocalization pipeline that reuses the built map, where keypoints, lines, and a structure graph are used to match the query frame with the map.

Stroke predominantly affects older adults, with 75% of cases occurring in individuals aged 65 and older, underscoring the urgent need for tailored rehabilitation strategies in aging populations. Despite the critical role therapists play in evaluating rehabilitation progress and ensuring the effectiveness of treatment, current assessment methods can often be subjective, inconsistent, and time-consuming, leading to delays in adjusting therapy protocols. This study aims to address these challenges by providing a solution for consistent and timely analysis. Specifically, we perform temporal segmentation of video recordings to capture detailed activities during stroke patients' rehabilitation. The main application scenario motivating this study is the clinical assessment of daily tabletop object interactions, which are crucial for post-stroke physical rehabilitation. To achieve this, we present a framework that leverages the biomechanics of movement during therapy sessions. Our solution divides the process into two main tasks: 2D keypoint detection to track patients' physical movements, and 1D time-series temporal segmentation to analyze these movements over time. This dual approach enables automated labeling with only a limited set of real-world data, addressing the challenges of variability in patient movements and limited dataset availability. By tackling these issues, our method shows strong potential for practical deployment in physical therapy settings, enhancing the speed and accuracy of rehabilitation assessments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Personalized Topology-Informed Localization of Standard 12-Lead ECG Electrode Placement from Incomplete Cardiac MRIs for Efficient Cardiac Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13945v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) offer personalized in-silico cardiac representations for the inference of multi-scale properties tied to cardiac mechanisms. The creation of CDTs requires precise information about the electrode position on the torso, especially for the personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) calibration. However, current studies commonly rely on additional acquisition of torso imaging and manual/semi-automatic methods for ECG electrode localization. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient topology-informed model to fully automatically extract personalized ECG standard electrode locations from 2D clinically standard cardiac MRIs. Specifically, we obtain the sparse torso contours from the cardiac MRIs and then localize the standard electrodes of 12-lead ECG from the contours. Cardiac MRIs aim at imaging of the heart instead of the torso, leading to incomplete torso geometry within the imaging. To tackle the missing topology, we incorporate the electrodes as a subset of the keypoints, which can be explicitly aligned with the 3D torso topology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the time-consuming conventional model projection-based method in terms of accuracy (Euclidean distance: $1.24 \pm 0.293$ cm vs. $1.48 \pm 0.362$ cm) and efficiency ($2$~s vs. $30$-$35$~min). We further demonstrate the effectiveness of using the detected electrodes for in-silico ECG simulation, highlighting their potential for creating accurate and efficient CDT models.

The primary goal is to transform high-resolution or high-dimensional data into an interpretable format to generate actionable insights, aiding decision-making and advancing knowledge. Currently, this task relies on complex, human-designed workflows comprising iterative steps such as denoising, spatial sampling, keypoint detection, feature generation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolutions. The introduction of machine learning over the past decade has accelerated tasks like image segmentation and object detection via supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction via unsupervised methods. However, both classical and NN-based approaches still require human input, whether for hyperparameter tuning, data labeling, or both. The growing use of automated imaging tools, from atomically resolved imaging to biological applications, demands unsupervised methods that optimize data representation for human decision-making or autonomous experimentation. Here, we discuss advances in reward-based workflows, which adopt expert decision-making principles and demonstrate strong transfer learning across diverse tasks. We represent image analysis as a decision-making process over possible operations and identify desiderata and their mappings to classical decision-making frameworks. Reward-driven workflows enable a shift from supervised, black-box models sensitive to distribution shifts to explainable, unsupervised, and robust optimization in image analysis. They can function as wrappers over classical and DCNN-based methods, making them applicable to both unsupervised and supervised workflows (e.g., classification, regression for structure-property mapping) across imaging and hyperspectral data.</p></details> | 38 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[Towards Biomarker Discovery for Early Cerebral Palsy Detection: Evaluating Explanations Through Kinematic Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16452v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a prevalent motor disability in children, for which early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. While skeleton-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models have shown promise in automatically predicting CP risk from infant videos, their "black-box" nature raises concerns about clinical explainability. To address this, we introduce a perturbation framework tailored for infant movement features and use it to compare two explainable AI (XAI) methods: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). First, we identify significant and non-significant body keypoints in very low- and very high-risk infant video snippets based on the XAI attribution scores. We then conduct targeted velocity and angular perturbations, both individually and in combination, on these keypoints to assess how the GCN model's risk predictions change. Our results indicate that velocity-driven features of the arms, hips, and legs have a dominant influence on CP risk predictions, while angular perturbations have a more modest impact. Furthermore, CAM and Grad-CAM show partial convergence in their explanations for both low- and high-risk CP groups. Our findings demonstrate the use of XAI-driven movement analysis for early CP prediction and offer insights into potential movement-based biomarker discovery that warrant further clinical validation.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures | None |

| **[SAM-LAD: Segment Anything Model Meets Zero-Shot Logic Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00625v4)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly detection is vital in real-world applications, such as industrial defect detection and medical diagnosis. However, most existing methods focus on local structural anomalies and fail to detect higher-level functional anomalies under logical conditions. Although recent studies have explored logical anomaly detection, they can only address simple anomalies like missing or addition and show poor generalizability due to being heavily data-driven. To fill this gap, we propose SAM-LAD, a zero-shot, plug-and-play framework for logical anomaly detection in any scene. First, we obtain a query image's feature map using a pre-trained backbone. Simultaneously, we retrieve the reference images and their corresponding feature maps via the nearest neighbor search of the query image. Then, we introduce the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain object masks of the query and reference images. Each object mask is multiplied with the entire image's feature map to obtain object feature maps. Next, an Object Matching Model (OMM) is proposed to match objects in the query and reference images. To facilitate object matching, we further propose a Dynamic Channel Graph Attention (DCGA) module, treating each object as a keypoint and converting its feature maps into feature vectors. Finally, based on the object matching relations, an Anomaly Measurement Model (AMM) is proposed to detect objects with logical anomalies. Structural anomalies in the objects can also be detected. We validate our proposed SAM-LAD using various benchmarks, including industrial datasets (MVTec Loco AD, MVTec AD), and the logical dataset (DigitAnatomy). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAM-LAD outperforms existing SoTA methods, particularly in detecting logical anomalies.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.05768 by other authors</p></details> | None |

While prior validation studies show MMMC performs well on average, they do not provide what is needed in clinical practice or for large-scale utilization of MMMC -- confidence intervals over specific kinematic estimates from a specific individual analyzed using a possibly unique camera configuration. We extend our previous work using an implicit representation of trajectories optimized end-to-end through a differentiable biomechanical model to learn the posterior probability distribution over pose given all the detected keypoints. This posterior probability is learned through a variational approximation and estimates confidence intervals for individual joints at each moment in a trial, showing confidence intervals generally within 10-15 mm of spatial error for virtual marker locations, consistent with our prior validation studies. Confidence intervals over joint angles are typically only a few degrees and widen for more distal joints. The posterior also models the correlation structure over joint angles, such as correlations between hip and pelvis angles. The confidence intervals estimated through this method allow us to identify times and trials where kinematic uncertainty is high.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[An Appearance Defect Detection Method for Cigarettes Based on C-CenterNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06119v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the poor adaptability of traditional methods in the cigarette detection task on the automatic cigarette production line, it is difficult to accurately identify whether a cigarette has defects and the types of defects; thus, a cigarette appearance defect detection method based on C-CenterNet is proposed. This detector uses keypoint estimation to locate center points and regresses all other defect properties. Firstly, Resnet50 is used as the backbone feature extraction network, and the convolutional block attention mechanism (CBAM) is introduced to enhance the network's ability to extract effective features and reduce the interference of non-target information. At the same time, the feature pyramid network is used to enhance the feature extraction of each layer. Then, deformable convolution is used to replace part of the common convolution to enhance the learning ability of different shape defects. Finally, the activation function ACON (ActivateOrNot) is used instead of the ReLU activation function, and the activation operation of some neurons is adaptively selected to improve the detection accuracy of the network. The experimental results are mainly acquired via the mean Average Precision (mAP). The experimental results show that the mAP of the C-CenterNet model applied in the cigarette appearance defect detection task is 95.01%. Compared with the original CenterNet model, the model's success rate is increased by 6.14%, so it can meet the requirements of precision and adaptability in cigarette detection tasks on the automatic cigarette production line.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures | None |

In recent years, the explosion of deep learning for vision applications has led to many works in surgical instrument segmentation, while lesser focus has been on tracking specific tool keypoints, such as tool tips. In this work, we propose a novel, multi-frame context-driven deep learning framework to localize and track tool keypoints in surgical videos. We train and test our models on the annotated frames from the 2015 EndoVis Challenge dataset, resulting in state-of-the-art performance. By leveraging sophisticated deep learning models and multi-frame context, we achieve 90\% keypoint detection accuracy and a localization RMS error of 5.27 pixels. Results on a self-annotated JIGSAWS dataset with more challenging scenarios also show that the proposed multi-frame models can accurately track tool-tip and tool-base keypoints, with ${<}4.2$-pixel RMS error overall. Such a framework paves the way for accurately tracking surgical instrument keypoints, enabling further downstream use cases.

| **[MIFNet: Learning Modality-Invariant Features for Generalizable Multimodal Image Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11299v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many keypoint detection and description methods have been proposed for image matching or registration. While these methods demonstrate promising performance for single-modality image matching, they often struggle with multimodal data because the descriptors trained on single-modality data tend to lack robustness against the non-linear variations present in multimodal data. Extending such methods to multimodal image matching often requires well-aligned multimodal data to learn modality-invariant descriptors. However, acquiring such data is often costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a modality-invariant feature learning network (MIFNet) to compute modality-invariant features for keypoint descriptions in multimodal image matching using only single-modality training data. Specifically, we propose a novel latent feature aggregation module and a cumulative hybrid aggregation module to enhance the base keypoint descriptors trained on single-modality data by leveraging pre-trained features from Stable Diffusion models. We validate our method with recent keypoint detection and description methods in three multimodal retinal image datasets (CF-FA, CF-OCT, EMA-OCTA) and two remote sensing datasets (Optical-SAR and Optical-NIR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIFNet is able to learn modality-invariant feature for multimodal image matching without accessing the targeted modality and has good zero-shot generalization ability.

Many depth sensing (or RGB-D) cameras are available on the market and selecting the best one for your application can be challenging. In this work, we tested four stereoscopic RGB-D cameras that sense the distance by using two images from slightly different views. We empirically compared four cameras (Intel RealSense D435, Intel RealSense D455, StereoLabs ZED 2, and Luxonis OAK-D Pro) in three scenarios: (i) planar surface perception, (ii) plastic doll perception, (iii) household object perception (YCB dataset). We recorded and evaluated more than 3,000 RGB-D frames for each camera. For table-top robotics scenarios with distance to objects up to one meter, the best performance is provided by the D435 camera. For longer distances, the other three models perform better, making them more suitable for some mobile robotics applications. OAK-D Pro additionally offers integrated AI modules (e.g., object and human keypoint detection). ZED 2 is not a standalone device and requires a computer with a GPU for depth data acquisition.

We provide theoretical results that outline conditions for the correctness of these gradients and provide efficient means for their computation. Our approach is first applied to two simple-but-demonstrative simulated examples, which expose the potential pitfalls of reliance on local optimization in existing, state-of-the-art, differentiable optimization methods.

Researchers have consistently aimed to leverage LiDAR's precise spatial information to enhance camera-based detectors through methods like depth supervision and bird-eye-view (BEV) feature distillation. However, existing approaches often face challenges due to the inherent differences between LiDAR and camera data representations. In this paper, we introduce the TiGDistill-BEV, a novel approach that effectively bridges this gap by leveraging the strengths of both sensors. Our method distills knowledge from diverse modalities(e.g., LiDAR) as the teacher model to a camera-based student detector, utilizing the Target Inner-Geometry learning scheme to enhance camera-based BEV detectors through both depth and BEV features by leveraging diverse modalities. Specially, we propose two key modules: an inner-depth supervision module to learn the low-level relative depth relations within objects which equips detectors with a deeper understanding of object-level spatial structures, and an inner-feature BEV distillation module to transfer high-level semantics of different key points within foreground targets. To further alleviate the domain gap, we incorporate both inter-channel and inter-keypoint distillation to model feature similarity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that TiGDistill-BEV significantly boosts camera-based only detectors achieving a state-of-the-art with 62.8% NDS and surpassing previous methods by a significant margin.

However, traditional sampling methods of preprocessing often ignore semantic features, leading to detail loss and ground point interference in 3D object detection. To address this, we propose a multi-branch two-stage 3D object detection framework using a Semantic-aware Multi-branch Sampling (SMS) module and multi-view consistency constraints. The SMS module includes random sampling, Density Equalization Sampling (DES) for enhancing distant objects, and Ground Abandonment Sampling (GAS) to focus on non-ground points. The sampled multi-view points are processed through a Consistent KeyPoint Selection (CKPS) module to generate consistent keypoint masks for efficient proposal sampling. The first-stage detector uses multi-branch parallel learning with multi-view consistency loss for feature aggregation, while the second-stage detector fuses multi-view data through a Multi-View Fusion Pooling (MVFP) module to precisely predict 3D objects. The experimental results on the KITTI dataset and Waymo Open Dataset show that our method achieves excellent detection performance improvement for a variety of backbones, especially for low-performance backbones with the simple network structures.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GIMS: Image Matching System Based on Adaptive Graph Construction and Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18221v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

| **[A Novel Approach to Tomato Harvesting Using a Hybrid Gripper with Semantic Segmentation and Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16755v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current agriculture and farming industries are able to reap advancements in robotics and automation technology to harvest fruits and vegetables using robots with adaptive grasping forces based on the compliance or softness of the fruit or vegetable. A successful operation depends on using a gripper that can adapt to the mechanical properties of the crops. This paper proposes a new robotic harvesting approach for tomato fruit using a novel hybrid gripper with a soft caging effect. It uses its six flexible passive auxetic structures based on fingers with rigid outer exoskeletons for good gripping strength and shape conformability. The gripper is actuated through a scotch-yoke mechanism using a servo motor. To perform tomato picking operations through a gripper, a vision system based on a depth camera and RGB camera implements the fruit identification process. It incorporates deep learning-based keypoint detection of the tomato's pedicel and body for localization in an occluded and variable ambient light environment and semantic segmentation of ripe and unripe tomatoes. In addition, robust trajectory planning of the robotic arm based on input from the vision system and control of robotic gripper movements are carried out for secure tomato handling. The tunable grasping force of the gripper would allow the robotic handling of fruits with a broad range of compliance.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we propose a novel fall detection system using FLAMe (Federated Learning with Attention Mechanism), a federated learning (FL) based algorithm. FLAMe trains around important keypoint information and only transmits the trained important weights to the server, reducing communication costs and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, the lightweight keypoint transformer model is integrated into the FL framework to effectively learn spatio-temporal features. We validated the experiment using 22,672 video samples from the "Fall Accident Risk Behavior Video-Sensor Pair data" dataset from AI-Hub. As a result of the experiment, the FLAMe-based system achieved an accuracy of 94.02% with about 190,000 transmission parameters, maintaining performance similar to that of existing centralized learning while maximizing efficiency by reducing communication costs by about 40% compared to the existing FL algorithm, FedAvg. Therefore, the FLAMe algorithm has demonstrated that it provides robust performance in the distributed environment of smart cities and is a practical and effective solution for public safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, AAAI 2025 FLUID Workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[Corn Ear Detection and Orientation Estimation Using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14954v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring growth behavior of maize plants such as the development of ears can give key insights into the plant's health and development. Traditionally, the measurement of the angle of ears is performed manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To address these challenges, this paper presents a computer vision-based system for detecting and tracking ears of corn in an image sequence. The proposed system could accurately detect, track, and predict the ear's orientation, which can be useful in monitoring their growth behavior. This can significantly save time compared to manual measurement and enables additional areas of ear orientation research and potential increase in efficiencies for maize production. Using an object detector with keypoint detection, the algorithm proposed could detect 90 percent of all ears. The cardinal estimation had a mean absolute error (MAE) of 18 degrees, compared to a mean 15 degree difference between two people measuring by hand. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using computer vision techniques for monitoring maize growth and can lead to further research in this area.</p></details> | 22 pages;15 figures | None |

Given a target video, these two fields are jointly optimized to reconstruct it through a carefully tailored rendering pipeline. We advisedly introduce some regularizations into the optimization process, urging the canonical content field to inherit semantics (e.g., the object shape) from the video. With such a design, CoDeF naturally supports lifting image algorithms for video processing, in the sense that one can apply an image algorithm to the canonical image and effortlessly propagate the outcomes to the entire video with the aid of the temporal deformation field. We experimentally show that CoDeF is able to lift image-to-image translation to video-to-video translation and lift keypoint detection to keypoint tracking without any training. More importantly, thanks to our lifting strategy that deploys the algorithms on only one image, we achieve superior cross-frame consistency in processed videos compared to existing video-to-video translation approaches, and even manage to track non-rigid objects like water and smog.

However, achieving nonlinearity-a critical component of computation-remains challenging in the optical domain. Here we introduce a design that leverages a multiple-scattering cavity to passively induce optical nonlinear random mapping with a continuous-wave laser at a low power. Each scattering event effectively mixes information from different areas of a spatial light modulator, resulting in a highly nonlinear mapping between the input data and output pattern. We demonstrate that our design retains vital information even when the readout dimensionality is reduced, thereby enabling optical data compression. This capability allows our optical platforms to offer efficient optical information processing solutions across applications. We demonstrate our design's efficacy across tasks, including classification, image reconstruction, keypoint detection and object detection, all of which are achieved through optical data compression combined with a digital decoder. In particular, high performance at extreme compression ratios is observed in real-time pedestrian detection. Our findings open pathways for novel algorithms and unconventional architectural designs for optical computing.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, current SCR methods often face challenges in handling repetitive textures and meaningless areas due to their reliance on implicit triangulation. In this paper, we propose an efficient scene coordinate encoding and relocalization method. Compared with the existing SCR methods, we design a unified architecture for both scene encoding and salient keypoint detection, enabling our system to focus on encoding informative regions, thereby significantly enhancing efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a mechanism that leverages sequential information during both map encoding and relocalization, which strengthens implicit triangulation, particularly in repetitive texture environments. Comprehensive experiments conducted across indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) SCR methods. Our single-frame relocalization mode improves the recall rate of our baseline by 6.4% and increases the running speed from 56Hz to 90Hz. Furthermore, our sequence-based mode increases the recall rate by 11% while maintaining the original efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, existing methods generally exhibit suboptimal performance under extreme conditions such as significant appearance changes and domain shifts. In this study, we introduce a multi-level feature aggregation network that incorporates two pivotal components to facilitate the learning of robust and accurate features with domain adaptation. First, we employ domain adaptation supervision to align high-level feature distributions across different domains to achieve invariant domain representations. Second, we propose a Transformer-based booster that enhances descriptor robustness by integrating visual and geometric information through wave position encoding concepts, effectively handling complex conditions. To ensure the accuracy and robustness of features, we adopt a hierarchical architecture to capture comprehensive information and apply meticulous targeted supervision to keypoint detection, descriptor extraction, and their coupled processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, RADA, achieves excellent results in image matching, camera pose estimation, and visual localization tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Point-level reasoning on visual data is challenging as it requires precise localization capability, posing problems even for powerful models like DINO or CLIP. Traditional methods for 3D keypoint detection rely heavily on annotated 3D datasets and extensive supervised training, limiting their scalability and applicability to new categories or domains. In contrast, our method utilizes the rich knowledge embedded within Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we demonstrate, for the first time, that pixel-level annotations used to train recent MLLMs can be exploited for both extracting and naming salient keypoints on 3D models without any ground truth labels or supervision. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks compared to supervised methods, despite not requiring any 3D keypoint annotations during training. Our results highlight the potential of integrating language models for localized 3D shape understanding. This work opens new avenues for cross-modal learning and underscores the effectiveness of MLLMs in contributing to 3D computer vision challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is accessible at https://sites.google.com/view/zerokey</p></details> | None |
| **[Key-Grid: Unsupervised 3D Keypoints Detection using Grid Heatmap Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02237v3)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting 3D keypoints with semantic consistency is widely used in many scenarios such as pose estimation, shape registration and robotics. Currently, most unsupervised 3D keypoint detection methods focus on the rigid-body objects. However, when faced with deformable objects, the keypoints they identify do not preserve semantic consistency well. In this paper, we introduce an innovative unsupervised keypoint detector Key-Grid for both the rigid-body and deformable objects, which is an autoencoder framework. The encoder predicts keypoints and the decoder utilizes the generated keypoints to reconstruct the objects. Unlike previous work, we leverage the identified keypoint in formation to form a 3D grid feature heatmap called grid heatmap, which is used in the decoder section. Grid heatmap is a novel concept that represents the latent variables for grid points sampled uniformly in the 3D cubic space, where these variables are the shortest distance between the grid points and the skeleton connected by keypoint pairs. Meanwhile, we incorporate the information from each layer of the encoder into the decoder section. We conduct an extensive evaluation of Key-Grid on a list of benchmark datasets. Key-Grid achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the semantic consistency and position accuracy of keypoints. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of Key-Grid to noise and downsampling. In addition, we achieve SE-(3) invariance of keypoints though generalizing Key-Grid to a SE(3)-invariant backbone.</p></details> |  | None |

Our dataset comprises over 1 million high-resolution images, each annotated with detailed 3D head meshes, facial landmarks, and bounding boxes. Using this dataset, we introduce a new model architecture capable of simultaneous head detection and head mesh reconstruction from a single image in a single step. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve strong performance on real images. Furthermore, the versatility of our dataset makes it applicable across a broad spectrum of tasks, offering a general and comprehensive representation of human heads.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose the first certifiably optimal category-level approach for simultaneous shape estimation and pose tracking of an object of known category (e.g. a car). Our approach uses 3D semantic keypoint measurements extracted from an RGB-D image sequence, and phrases the estimation as a fixed-lag smoothing problem. Temporal constraints enforce the object's rigidity (fixed shape) and smooth motion according to a constant-twist motion model. The solutions to this problem are the estimates of the object's state (poses, velocities) and shape (paramaterized according to the active shape model) over the smoothing horizon. Our key contribution is to show that despite the non-convexity of the fixed-lag smoothing problem, we can solve it to certifiable optimality using a small-size semidefinite relaxation. We also present a fast outlier rejection scheme that filters out incorrect keypoint detections with shape and time compatibility tests, and wrap our certifiable solver in a graduated non-convexity scheme. We evaluate the proposed approach on synthetic and real data, showcasing its performance in a table-top manipulation scenario and a drone-based vehicle tracking application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE RA-L. 11 pages, 6 figures (with appendix).

Our approach estimates key geometric features -- including diameter, length, and volume -- for rod-like geometries with varying curvature and general objects with constant skeleton slope. The framework integrates segmentation, mask processing, skeleton construction, and 2D-3D transformation, packaged in a user-friendly interface. We validate our framework by estimating the diameters of Canola stems -- collected from agricultural fields in North Dakota -- which are thin and non-uniform, posing challenges for existing methods. Measuring its diameters is critical, as it is a phenotypic traits that correlates with the health and yield of Canola crops. This application also exemplifies the potential of Measure Anything, where integrating intelligent models -- such as keypoint detection -- extends its scalability to fully automate the measurement process for high-throughput applications.

Although CNN-based and Transformer-based methods have achieved breakthrough progress, they often fail to deliver superior performance and real-time speed. This paper introduces MamKPD, the first efficient yet effective mamba-based pose estimation framework for 2D keypoint detection. The conventional Mamba module exhibits limited information interaction between patches. To address this, we propose a lightweight contextual modeling module (CMM) that uses depth-wise convolutions to model inter-patch dependencies and linear layers to distill the pose cues within each patch. Subsequently, by combining Mamba for global modeling across all patches, MamKPD effectively extracts instances' pose information. We conduct extensive experiments on human and animal pose estimation datasets to validate the effectiveness of MamKPD. Our MamKPD-L achieves 77.3% AP on the COCO dataset with 1492 FPS on an NVIDIA GTX 4090 GPU. Moreover, MamKPD achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPII dataset and competitive results on the AP-10K dataset while saving 85% of the parameters compared to ViTPose.

Cattle's body shape and joint articulation carry significant information about their welfare, yet acquiring comprehensive datasets for 3D body pose estimation presents a formidable challenge. This study delves into the construction of such a dataset specifically tailored for cattle. Leveraging the expertise of digital artists, we use a single animated 3D model to represent diverse cattle postures. To address the disparity between virtual and real-world data, we augment the 3D model's shape to encompass a range of potential body appearances, thereby narrowing the "sim2real" gap. We use these annotated models to train a deep-learning framework capable of estimating internal joints solely based on external surface curvature. Our contribution is specifically the use of geodesic distance over the surface manifold, coupled with multilateration to extract joints in a semantic keypoint detection encoder-decoder architecture. We demonstrate the robustness of joint extraction by comparing the link lengths extracted on real cattle mobbing and walking within a race. Furthermore, inspired by the established allometric relationship between bone length and the overall height of mammals, we utilise the estimated joints to predict hip height within a real cattle dataset, extending the utility of our approach to offer insights into improving cattle monitoring practices.</p></details> |  | None |

A keen interest was manifested by researchers in the last decade to characterize and manipulate deformable objects of non-fluid nature, such as clothes and ropes. Even though several propositions were made in the regard of object characterization, however researchers were always confronted with the need of pixel-level information of the object through images to extract relevant information. This usually is accomplished by means of segmentation networks trained on manually labeled data for this purpose. In this paper, we address the subject of characterizing weld pool to define stable features that serve as information for further motion control objectives. We achieve this by employing different pipelines. The first one consists of characterizing fluid deformable objects through the use of a generative model that is trained using a teacher-student framework. And in the second one we leverage foundation models by using them as teachers to characterize the object in the image, without the need of any pre-training and any dataset. The performance of knowledge distillation from foundation models into a smaller generative model shows prominent results in the characterization of deformable objects. The student network was capable of learning to retrieve the keypoitns of the object with an error of 13.4 pixels. And the teacher was evaluated based on its capacities to retrieve pixel level information represented by the object mask, with a mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of 75.26%.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional frameworks, such as object detection, segmentation, and keypoint detection, struggle in resource-constrained environments, often resulting in substantial target omissions. To address these challenges, we introduce OCDet, a lightweight Object Center Detection framework optimized for edge devices with NPUs. OCDet predicts heatmaps representing object center probabilities and extracts center points through peak identification. Unlike prior methods using fixed Gaussian distribution, we introduce Generalized Centerness (GC) to generate ground truth heatmaps from bounding box annotations, providing finer spatial details without additional manual labeling. Built on NPU-friendly Semantic FPN with MobileNetV4 backbones, OCDet models are trained by our Balanced Continuous Focal Loss (BCFL), which alleviates data imbalance and focuses training on hard negative examples for probability regression tasks. Leveraging the novel Center Alignment Score (CAS) with Hungarian matching, we demonstrate that OCDet consistently outperforms YOLO11 in object center detection, achieving up to 23% higher CAS while requiring 42% fewer parameters, 34% less computation, and 64% lower NPU latency. When compared to keypoint detection frameworks, OCDet achieves substantial CAS improvements up to 186% using identical models. By integrating GC, BCFL, and CAS, OCDet establishes a new paradigm for efficient and robust object center detection on edge devices with NPUs.

The key to accuracy and robustness lies in high-quality training data. Existing training datasets containing real images with pseudo ground truth (pGT) use SMPLify to fit SMPL to sparse 2D joint locations, assuming a simplified camera with default intrinsics. We make two contributions that improve pGT accuracy. First, to estimate camera intrinsics, we develop a field-of-view prediction model (HumanFoV) trained on a dataset of images containing people. We use the estimated intrinsics to enhance the 4D-Humans dataset by incorporating a full perspective camera model during SMPLify fitting. Second, 2D joints provide limited constraints on 3D body shape, resulting in average-looking bodies. To address this, we use the BEDLAM dataset to train a dense surface keypoint detector. We apply this detector to the 4D-Humans dataset and modify SMPLify to fit the detected keypoints, resulting in significantly more realistic body shapes. Finally, we upgrade the HMR2.0 architecture to include the estimated camera parameters. We iterate model training and SMPLify fitting initialized with the previously trained model. This leads to more accurate pGT and a new model, CameraHMR, with state-of-the-art accuracy. Code and pGT are available for research purposes.</p></details> | 3DV 2025 | None |

Due to the presence of two modalities, misalignment and modality imbalance are the most significant issues in multispectral pedestrian detection. In this paper, we propose M ulti S pectral pedestrian DE tection TR ansformer (MS-DETR) to fix above issues. MS-DETR consists of two modality-specific backbones and Transformer encoders, followed by a multi-modal Transformer decoder, and the visible and thermal features are fused in the multi-modal Transformer decoder. To well resist the misalignment between multi-modal images, we design a loosely coupled fusion strategy by sparsely sampling some keypoints from multi-modal features independently and fusing them with adaptively learned attention weights. Moreover, based on the insight that not only different modalities, but also different pedestrian instances tend to have different confidence scores to final detection, we further propose an instance-aware modality-balanced optimization strategy, which preserves visible and thermal decoder branches and aligns their predicted slots through an instance-wise dynamic loss.

The study evaluates two pose estimation workflows: DeepLabCut, known for its application in laboratory settings and emerging wildlife fieldwork, and YOLO-NAS-Pose, a newly released pose estimation model not previously applied to wildlife behavioral studies. These models are trained to analyze elephant herd behavior, focusing on low-resolution ($\sim$50 pixels) subjects to detect key points such as the head, spine, and ears of multiple elephants within a frame. Both workflows demonstrated acceptable quality of pose estimation on the test set, facilitating the automated detection of basic behaviors crucial for studying elephant herd dynamics. For the metrics selected for pose estimation evaluation on the test set -- root mean square error (RMSE), percentage of correct keypoints (PCK), and object keypoint similarity (OKS) -- the YOLO-NAS-Pose workflow outperformed DeepLabCut. Additionally, YOLO-NAS-Pose exceeded DeepLabCut in object detection evaluation. This approach introduces a novel method for wildlife behavioral research, including the burgeoning field of wildlife drone monitoring, with significant implications for wildlife conservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CV4Animals: Computer Vision for Animal Behavior Tracking and Modeling Workshop in conjunction with Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2024</p></details> | None |

This paper aims to adapt to specific fields at low cost using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). We explore a novel domain shift from a diverse, large pool of internet-sourced data to a small set of data collected by a robot at specific locations, minimizing the need for extensive on-field data collection. Additionally, we introduce a novel module -- the Multi-level Attention-based Adversarial Discriminator (MAAD) -- which can be integrated at the feature extractor level of any detection model. In this study, we incorporate MAAD with CenterNet to simultaneously detect leaf, stem, and vein instances. Our results show significant performance improvements in the unlabeled target domain compared to baseline models, with a 7.5% increase in object detection accuracy and a 5.1% improvement in keypoint detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[LiFT: A Surprisingly Simple Lightweight Feature Transform for Dense ViT Descriptors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14625v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple self-supervised method to enhance the performance of ViT features for dense downstream tasks. Our Lightweight Feature Transform (LiFT) is a straightforward and compact postprocessing network that can be applied to enhance the features of any pre-trained ViT backbone. LiFT is fast and easy to train with a self-supervised objective, and it boosts the density of ViT features for minimal extra inference cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LiFT can be applied with approaches that use additional task-specific downstream modules, as we integrate LiFT with ViTDet for COCO detection and segmentation. Despite the simplicity of LiFT, we find that it is not simply learning a more complex version of bilinear interpolation. Instead, our LiFT training protocol leads to several desirable emergent properties that benefit ViT features in dense downstream tasks. This includes greater scale invariance for features, and better object boundary maps. By simply training LiFT for a few epochs, we show improved performance on keypoint correspondence, detection, segmentation, and object discovery tasks. Overall, LiFT provides an easy way to unlock the benefits of denser feature arrays for a fraction of the computational cost.

Traditional search-based methods depend on initial camera pose estimates, which can struggle in non-standard positions and dynamic environments. In response, we propose an optimization-based calibration pipeline that leverages a 3D soccer field model and a predefined set of keypoints to overcome these limitations. Our method also introduces a novel refinement module that improves initial calibration by using detected field lines in a non-linear optimization process. This approach outperforms existing techniques in both multi-view and single-view 3D camera calibration tasks, while maintaining competitive performance in homography estimation. Extensive experimentation on real-world soccer datasets, including SoccerNet-Calibration, WorldCup 2014, and TS-WorldCup, highlights the robustness and accuracy of our method across diverse broadcast scenarios. Our approach offers significant improvements in camera calibration precision and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of "No Bells, Just Whistles: Sports Field Registration Leveraging Geometric Properties"</p></details> | None |

However, how to best control the image content remains an open challenge. We introduce LatentKeypointGAN, a two-stage GAN which is trained end-to-end on the classical GAN objective with internal conditioning on a set of space keypoints. These keypoints have associated appearance embeddings that respectively control the position and style of the generated objects and their parts. A major difficulty that we address with suitable network architectures and training schemes is disentangling the image into spatial and appearance factors without domain knowledge and supervision signals. We demonstrate that LatentKeypointGAN provides an interpretable latent space that can be used to re-arrange the generated images by re-positioning and exchanging keypoint embeddings, such as generating portraits by combining the eyes, nose, and mouth from different images. In addition, the explicit generation of keypoints and matching images enables a new, GAN-based method for unsupervised keypoint detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Facial Chick Sexing: An Automated Chick Sexing System From Chick Facial Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09155v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chick sexing, the process of determining the gender of day-old chicks, is a critical task in the poultry industry due to the distinct roles that each gender plays in production. While effective traditional methods achieve high accuracy, color, and wing feather sexing is exclusive to specific breeds, and vent sexing is invasive and requires trained experts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach inspired by facial gender classification techniques in humans: facial chick sexing. This new method does not require expert knowledge and aims to reduce training time while enhancing animal welfare by minimizing chick manipulation. We develop a comprehensive system for training and inference that includes data collection, facial and keypoint detection, facial alignment, and classification. We evaluate our model on two sets of images: Cropped Full Face and Cropped Middle Face, both of which maintain essential facial features of the chick for further analysis. Our experiment demonstrates the promising viability, with a final accuracy of 81.89%, of this approach for future practices in chick sexing by making them more universally applicable.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Soccer Camera Calibration Through Keypoint Exploitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07401v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate camera calibration is essential for transforming 2D images from camera sensors into 3D world coordinates, enabling precise scene geometry interpretation and supporting sports analytics tasks such as player tracking, offside detection, and performance analysis. However, obtaining a sufficient number of high-quality point pairs remains a significant challenge for both traditional and deep learning-based calibration methods. This paper introduces a multi-stage pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging the structural features of the football pitch. Our approach significantly increases the number of usable points for calibration by exploiting line-line and line-conic intersections, points on the conics, and other geometric features. To mitigate the impact of imperfect annotations, we employ data fitting techniques. Our pipeline utilizes deep learning for keypoint and line detection and incorporates geometric constraints based on real-world pitch dimensions. A voter algorithm iteratively selects the most reliable keypoints, further enhancing calibration accuracy. We evaluated our approach on the largest football broadcast camera calibration dataset available, and secured the top position in the SoccerNet Camera Calibration Challenge 2023 [arXiv:2309.06006], which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

Current methods for evaluating robustness rely on collecting and annotating extensive test sets. While this is common practice, the process is labor-intensive and expensive with no guarantee of sufficient coverage across attributes of interest. Recently, model diagnosis frameworks have emerged leveraging user inputs (e.g., text) to assess the vulnerability of the model. However, such dependence on human can introduce bias and limitation given the domain knowledge of particular users. This paper proposes Unsupervised Model Diagnosis (UMO), that leverages generative models to produce semantic counterfactual explanations without any user guidance. Given a differentiable computer vision model (i.e., the target model), UMO optimizes for the most counterfactual directions in a generative latent space. Our approach identifies and visualizes changes in semantics, and then matches these changes to attributes from wide-ranging text sources, such as dictionaries or language models. We validate the framework on multiple vision tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation, keypoint detection). Extensive experiments show that our unsupervised discovery of semantic directions can correctly highlight spurious correlations and visualize the failure mode of target models without any human intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Traditional approaches typically require separate models for each garment type, which limits scalability and adaptability. In contrast, this paper presents a unified approach using vision-language models (VLMs) to improve keypoint prediction across various garment categories. By interpreting both visual and semantic information, our model enables robots to manage different garment states with a single model. We created a large-scale synthetic dataset using advanced simulation techniques, allowing scalable training without extensive real-world data. Experimental results indicate that the VLM-based method significantly enhances keypoint detection accuracy and task success rates, providing a more flexible and general solution for robotic garment manipulation. In addition, this research also underscores the potential of VLMs to unify various garment manipulation tasks within a single framework, paving the way for broader applications in home automation and assistive robotics for future.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional methods such as stationary sensors and mobile systems like UAVs are limited in coverage and constrained by high costs and legal restrictions. Satellite-based approaches provide broad spatial coverage but face challenges, including high costs, low frame rates, and difficulty detecting small vehicles in high-resolution imagery. We propose a Keypoint R-CNN model to track vehicle trajectories across RGB bands, leveraging band timing differences to estimate speed. Validation is performed using drone footage and GPS data covering highways in Germany and Poland. Our model achieved a Mean Average Precision of 0.53 and velocity estimation errors of approximately 3.4 m/s compared to GPS data. Results from drone comparison reveal underestimations, with average speeds of 112.85 km/h for satellite data versus 131.83 km/h from drone footage. While challenges remain with high-speed accuracy, this approach demonstrates the potential for scalable, daily traffic monitoring across vast areas, providing valuable insights into global traffic dynamics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Keypoint Detection with Distilled Depth Keypoint Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14700v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing unsupervised keypoint detection methods apply artificial deformations to images such as masking a significant portion of images and using reconstruction of original image as a learning objective to detect keypoints. However, this approach lacks depth information in the image and often detects keypoints on the background. To address this, we propose Distill-DKP, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages depth maps and RGB images for keypoint detection in a self-supervised setting. During training, Distill-DKP extracts embedding-level knowledge from a depth-based teacher model to guide an image-based student model with inference restricted to the student. Experiments show that Distill-DKP significantly outperforms previous unsupervised methods by reducing mean L2 error by 47.15% on Human3.6M, mean average error by 5.67% on Taichi, and improving keypoints accuracy by 1.3% on DeepFashion dataset. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate the sensitivity of knowledge distillation across different layers of the network.

The former typically relies on laborious and time-consuming manual annotations, posing considerable challenges in expanding keypoint detection to a broader range of keypoint categories and animal species. The latter, though less dependent on extensive manual input, still requires necessary support images with annotation for reference during testing. To realize zero-shot keypoint detection without any prior annotation, we introduce the Open-Vocabulary Keypoint Detection (OVKD) task, which is innovatively designed to use text prompts for identifying arbitrary keypoints across any species. In pursuit of this goal, we have developed a novel framework named Open-Vocabulary Keypoint Detection with Semantic-feature Matching (KDSM). This framework synergistically combines vision and language models, creating an interplay between language features and local keypoint visual features. KDSM enhances its capabilities by integrating Domain Distribution Matrix Matching (DDMM) and other special modules, such as the Vision-Keypoint Relational Awareness (VKRA) module, improving the framework's generalizability and overall performance.Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KDSM significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of performance and achieves remarkable success in the OVKD task.Impressively, our method, operating in a zero-shot fashion, still yields results comparable to state-of-the-art few-shot species class-agnostic keypoint detection methods.We will make the source code publicly accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Computer Vision</p></details> | None |

Most existing models accept either the text prompt (e.g., ``the nose of a cat''), or the visual prompt (e.g., support image with keypoint annotations), to detect the corresponding keypoints in query image, thereby, exhibiting either zero-shot or few-shot detection ability. However, the research on taking multimodal prompt is still underexplored, and the prompt diversity in semantics and language is far from opened. For example, how to handle unseen text prompts for novel keypoint detection and the diverse text prompts like ``Can you detect the nose and ears of a cat?'' In this work, we open the prompt diversity from three aspects: modality, semantics (seen v.s. unseen), and language, to enable a more generalized zero- and few-shot keypoint detection (Z-FSKD). We propose a novel OpenKD model which leverages multimodal prototype set to support both visual and textual prompting. Further, to infer the keypoint location of unseen texts, we add the auxiliary keypoints and texts interpolated from visual and textual domains into training, which improves the spatial reasoning of our model and significantly enhances zero-shot novel keypoint detection. We also found large language model (LLM) is a good parser, which achieves over 96% accuracy to parse keypoints from texts. With LLM, OpenKD can handle diverse text prompts. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Z-FSKD and initiates new ways to deal with unseen text and diverse texts.

However, 3D reconstruction of underground objects to generate point cloud maps remains a challenge. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is one of the most powerful and extensively used tools for detecting and locating underground objects such as plant root systems and pipelines, with its cost-effectiveness and continuously evolving technology. This paper introduces a parabolic signal detection network based on deep convolutional neural networks, utilizing B-scan images from GPR sensors. The detected keypoints can aid in accurately fitting parabolic curves used to interpret the original GPR B-scan images as cross-sections of the object model. Additionally, a multi-task point cloud network was designed to perform both point cloud segmentation and completion simultaneously, filling in sparse point cloud maps. For unknown locations, GPR A-scan data can be used to match corresponding A-scan data in the constructed map, pinpointing the position to verify the accuracy of the map construction by the model.

| **[PoIFusion: Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection via Fusion at Points of Interest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09212v2)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present PoIFusion, a conceptually simple yet effective multi-modal 3D object detection framework to fuse the information of RGB images and LiDAR point clouds at the points of interest (PoIs). Different from the most accurate methods to date that transform multi-sensor data into a unified view or leverage the global attention mechanism to facilitate fusion, our approach maintains the view of each modality and obtains multi-modal features by computation-friendly projection and interpolation. In particular, our PoIFusion follows the paradigm of query-based object detection, formulating object queries as dynamic 3D boxes and generating a set of PoIs based on each query box. The PoIs serve as the keypoints to represent a 3D object and play the role of the basic units in multi-modal fusion. Specifically, we project PoIs into the view of each modality to sample the corresponding feature and integrate the multi-modal features at each PoI through a dynamic fusion block. Furthermore, the features of PoIs derived from the same query box are aggregated together to update the query feature. Our approach prevents information loss caused by view transformation and eliminates the computation-intensive global attention, making the multi-modal 3D object detector more applicable. We conducted extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets to evaluate our approach. Remarkably, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both datasets without any bells and whistles, \emph{i.e.}, 74.9\% NDS and 73.4\% mAP on nuScenes, and 31.6\% CDS and 40.6\% mAP on Argoverse2.

However, accurate and robust angle estimation from fisheye images in the Manhattan world has remained an open challenge because general scene images tend to lack constraints such as lines, arcs, and vanishing points. To achieve higher accuracy and robustness, we propose a learning-based calibration method that uses heatmap regression, which is similar to pose estimation using keypoints, to detect the directions of labeled image coordinates. Simultaneously, our two estimators recover the rotation and remove fisheye distortion by remapping from a general scene image. Without considering vanishing-point constraints, we find that additional points for learning-based methods can be defined. To compensate for the lack of vanishing points in images, we introduce auxiliary diagonal points that have the optimal 3D arrangement of spatial uniformity. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms conventional methods on large-scale datasets and with off-the-shelf cameras.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 | None |
