| **[Contribution-Guided Asymmetric Learning for Robust Multimodal Fusion under Imbalance and Noise](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26289v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning faces two major challenges: modality imbalance and data noise, which significantly affect the robustness and generalization ability of models. Existing methods achieve modality balance by suppressing dominant modalities, but they neglect the inherent differences in the information value between modalities, potentially leading to convergence to suboptimal solutions. This paper proposes an innovative modality compression paradigm, Contribution-Guided Asymmetric Learning (CAL), which aims to enhance the contribution of high-contribution modalities while compressing weak modalities to increase their contribution, allowing both to improve the performance of multimodal information fusion. CAL is based on a modality contribution metric W^m combining the information quantity I(m) and confidence D(m), and it designs an asymmetric gradient acceleration mechanism and a contribution-aware Asymmetric Information Bottleneck (AIB) compression mechanism. The former accelerates the gradient update of modalities, while the latter dynamically compresses the noise of low-contribution modalities. On five benchmark datasets, including emotion recognition, scene recognition, and event localization tasks, CAL has shown outstanding performance in imbalanced fusion tasks and noise robustness tests. On CREMA-D, KS, and AVE, CAL achieves 79.30%, 74.82%, and 74.21% accuracy, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art model ARL. In high-noise robustness tests, CAL also achieved leading performance under various attack strategies on the MVSA-Single and NYUD2 datasets. These results validate the significant advantages of CAL in modality imbalance and noise interference. CAL, as a flexible and efficient framework, is easy to transfer to other tasks and has broad adaptability and potential application prospects.</p></details> |  | None |

The quadratic complexity in attention and autoregressive generation, as well as the constantly growing key value (KV) cache size, severely hinder the prefilling and decoding stages. Recent efforts have attempted to compress KV cache by identifying and pruning KV cache of less important tokens, but these methods typically rely on attention scores to estimate token importance, making them incompatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Sparse Attention, which do not explicitly compute attention matrices. Moreover, existing methods overlook how sparse attention, while accelerating the prefilling stage, alters the information structure of the KV cache, thereby compromising the effectiveness of downstream KV cache compression strategies. To address this issue, we propose PureKV, a plug-and-play framework for joint optimization of sparse attention and KV cache compression. We first introduce a KV cache compression strategy that is fully compatible with efficient attention accelerators. Our method utilizes lower layer attention scores to estimate the importance of high layers' KV cache, enabling active pruning without compromising accuracy. In addition, we have designed a Spatial-Temporal Sparse Attention (ST-SpAttn) module specifically tailored for video KV cache compression algorithms. This module combines spatial and temporal attention sparsity to improve the compression efficiency of KV cache optimization algorithms by purifying spatial noise and temporal redundancy in KV cache. At the same time, ST-SpAttn also accelerated the prefilling stage of VLLMs. Extensive experiments on VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2, Qwen2.5-VL) have shown that PureKV achieves 5.0 times KV cache compression and 3.16 times prefill acceleration, with negligible quality degradation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FourierCompress: Layer-Aware Spectral Activation Compression for Efficient and Accurate Collaborative LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16418v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative large language model (LLM) inference enables real-time, privacy-preserving AI services on resource-constrained edge devices by partitioning computational workloads between client devices and edge servers. However, this paradigm is severely hindered by communication bottlenecks caused by the transmission of high-dimensional intermediate activations, exacerbated by the autoregressive decoding structure of LLMs, where bandwidth consumption scales linearly with output length. Existing activation compression methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high compression ratios, low reconstruction error, and computational efficiency. This paper proposes FourierCompress, a novel, layer-aware activation compression framework that exploits the frequency-domain sparsity of LLM activations. We rigorously demonstrate that activations from the first Transformer layer exhibit strong smoothness and energy concentration in the low-frequency domain, making them highly amenable to near-lossless compression via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). FourierCompress transforms activations into the frequency domain, retains only a compact block of low-frequency coefficients, and reconstructs the signal at the server using conjugate symmetry, enabling seamless hardware acceleration on DSPs and FPGAs. Extensive experiments on Llama 3 and Qwen2.5 models across 10 commonsense reasoning datasets demonstrate that FourierCompress preserves performance remarkably close to the uncompressed baseline, outperforming Top-k, QR, and SVD. FourierCompress bridges the gap between communication efficiency (an average 7.6x reduction in activation size), near-lossless inference (less than 0.3% average accuracy loss), and significantly faster compression (achieving over 32x reduction in compression time compared to Top-k via hardware acceleration) for edge-device LLM inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Autoencoding-Free Context Compression for LLMs via Contextual Semantic Anchors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08907v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.</p></details> | 18 pages,9 figures | None |
| **[Are We Using the Right Benchmark: An Evaluation Framework for Visual Token Compression Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07143v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of visual token compression methods.

DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii) AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than their base counterparts without compromising quality, and further enable 2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU.

| **[Efficient Reasoning Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10903v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable progress in solving complex and logic-intensive tasks by generating extended Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) prior to arriving at a final answer. Yet, the emergence of this "slow-thinking" paradigm, with numerous tokens generated in sequence, inevitably introduces substantial computational overhead. To this end, it highlights an urgent need for effective acceleration. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in efficient reasoning. It categorizes existing works into three key directions: (1) shorter - compressing lengthy CoTs into concise yet effective reasoning chains; (2) smaller - developing compact language models with strong reasoning capabilities through techniques such as knowledge distillation, other model compression techniques, and reinforcement learning; and (3) faster - designing efficient decoding strategies to accelerate inference of reasoning models. A curated collection of papers discussed in this survey is available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/fscdc/Awesome-Efficient-Reasoning-Models.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/fscdc/Awesome-Efficient-Reasoning-Models) |
| **[Diffusion Generative Models Meet Compressed Sensing, with Applications to Imaging and Finance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03898v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study we develop dimension-reduction techniques to accelerate diffusion model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models (hence, CSDM): First, compress the dataset into a latent space (from an ambient space), and train a diffusion model in the latent space; next, apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent space for decoding back to the original space; and the goal is to facilitate the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under certain sparsity assumptions on data, our proposed approach achieves provably faster convergence, via combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. It also sheds light on the best choice of the latent space dimension. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we run numerical experiments on a range of datasets, including handwritten digits, medical and climate images, and financial time series for stress testing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SnipSnap: A Joint Compression Format and Dataflow Co-Optimization Framework for Efficient Sparse LLM Accelerator Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17072v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing scale of large language models (LLMs) has intensified demands on computation and memory, making efficient inference a key challenge. While sparsity can reduce these costs, existing design space exploration (DSE) frameworks often overlook compression formats, a key factor for leveraging sparsity on accelerators. This paper proposes SnipSnap, a joint compression format and dataflow co-optimization framework for efficient sparse LLM accelerator design. SnipSnap introduces: (1) a hierarchical compression format encoding to expand the design space; (2) an adaptive compression engine for selecting formats under diverse sparsity; and (3) a progressive co-search workflow that jointly optimizes dataflow and compression formats. SnipSnap achieves 18.24% average memory energy savings via format optimization, along with 2248.3$\times$ and 21.0$\times$ speedups over Sparseloop and DiMO-Sparse frameworks, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 31st Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2026)</p></details> | None |
| **[LoopServe: An Adaptive Dual-phase LLM Inference Acceleration System for Multi-Turn Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13681v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. As a result, these models cannot accurately identify and prioritize the most relevant context, leading to degraded response quality. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a new benchmark with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DiTReducio: A Training-Free Acceleration for DiT-Based TTS via Progressive Calibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09748v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have advanced non-autoregressive (NAR) speech synthesis, their high computational demands remain an limitation. Existing DiT-based text-to-speech (TTS) model acceleration approaches mainly focus on reducing sampling steps through distillation techniques, yet they remain constrained by training costs. We introduce DiTReducio, a training-free acceleration framework that compresses computations in DiT-based TTS models via progressive calibration. We propose two compression methods, Temporal Skipping and Branch Skipping, to eliminate redundant computations during inference. Moreover, based on two characteristic attention patterns identified within DiT layers, we devise a pattern-guided strategy to selectively apply the compression methods. Our method allows flexible modulation between generation quality and computational efficiency through adjustable compression thresholds. Experimental evaluations conducted on F5-TTS and MegaTTS 3 demonstrate that DiTReducio achieves a 75.4% reduction in FLOPs and improves the Real-Time Factor (RTF) by 37.1%, while preserving generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mask-Encoded Sparsification: Mitigating Biased Gradients in Communication-Efficient Split Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13787v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel framework designed to achieve a high compression ratio in Split Learning (SL) scenarios where resource-constrained devices are involved in large-scale model training. Our investigations demonstrate that compressing feature maps within SL leads to biased gradients that can negatively impact the convergence rates and diminish the generalization capabilities of the resulting models. Our theoretical analysis provides insights into how compression errors critically hinder SL performance, which previous methodologies underestimate. To address these challenges, we employ a narrow bit-width encoded mask to compensate for the sparsification error without increasing the order of time complexity. Supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, our framework significantly reduces compression errors and accelerates the convergence. Extensive experiments also verify that our method outperforms existing solutions regarding training efficiency and communication complexity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Empirical Study of Knowledge Distillation for Code Understanding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15423v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026 (Cycle 1)</p></details> | None |
| **[DECA: A Near-Core LLM Decompression Accelerator Grounded on a 3D Roofline Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19349v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To alleviate the memory bandwidth bottleneck in Large Language Model (LLM) inference workloads, weight matrices are stored in memory in quantized and sparsified formats. Hence, before tiles of these matrices can be processed by in-core generalized matrix multiplication (GeMM) hardware engines, they need to be dequantized and de-sparsified. This is currently performed in software with vector operations. Unfortunately, this approach delivers only modest performance. Moreover, it is hard to understand how to improve the system, as the overall GeMM performance depends on the interaction between memory resources, vector units, and hardware matrix engines. To improve the performance of LLM inference in advanced platforms equipped with in-core GeMM engines and HBM, this paper makes three main contributions. First, it develops an analytical performance model with a 3D visual representation that provides insights into how memory resources, vector units, and hardware matrix engines interact to deliver compressed GeMM performance. Second, it proposes DECA, a new near-core ML-model decompression accelerator. DECA offloads tile de-sparsification and dequantization from the CPU, producing ready-to-use tiles for in-core GeMM engines. Third, it introduces a new ISA extension that enables out-of-order invocation of the near-core accelerator. With this extension, accelerator and core computations can interleave and overlap with high-performance. Our evaluation shows that, in a simulated 56-core Xeon 4 server with HBM, DECA accelerates the execution of compressed GeMMs by up to 4x over the use of optimized Intel software kernels. Further, DECA reduces the next-token generation time of Llama2-70B and OPT-66B by 1.6x-2.6x.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unlocking the Potential of Digital Pathology: Novel Baselines for Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13137v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology offers a groundbreaking opportunity to transform clinical practice in histopathological image analysis, yet faces a significant hurdle: the substantial file sizes of pathological Whole Slide Images (WSI). While current digital pathology solutions rely on lossy JPEG compression to address this issue, lossy compression can introduce color and texture disparities, potentially impacting clinical decision-making. While prior research addresses perceptual image quality and downstream performance independently of each other, we jointly evaluate compression schemes for perceptual and downstream task quality on four different datasets. In addition, we collect an initially uncompressed dataset for an unbiased perceptual evaluation of compression schemes. Our results show that deep learning models fine-tuned for perceptual quality outperform conventional compression schemes like JPEG-XL or WebP for further compression of WSI. However, they exhibit a significant bias towards the compression artifacts present in the training data and struggle to generalize across various compression schemes. We introduce a novel evaluation metric based on feature similarity between original files and compressed files that aligns very well with the actual downstream performance on the compressed WSI. Our metric allows for a general and standardized evaluation of lossy compression schemes and mitigates the requirement to independently assess different downstream tasks. Our study provides novel insights for the assessment of lossy compression schemes for WSI and encourages a unified evaluation of lossy compression schemes to accelerate the clinical uptake of digital pathology.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SSVQ: Unleashing the Potential of Vector Quantization with Sign-Splitting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08668v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector Quantization (VQ) has emerged as a prominent weight compression technique, showcasing substantially lower quantization errors than uniform quantization across diverse models, particularly in extreme compression scenarios. However, its efficacy during fine-tuning is limited by the constraint of the compression format, where weight vectors assigned to the same codeword are restricted to updates in the same direction. Consequently, many quantized weights are compelled to move in directions contrary to their local gradient information. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel VQ paradigm, Sign-Splitting VQ (SSVQ), which decouples the sign bit of weights from the codebook. Our approach involves extracting the sign bits of uncompressed weights and performing clustering and compression on all-positive weights. We then introduce latent variables for the sign bit and jointly optimize both the signs and the codebook. Additionally, we implement a progressive freezing strategy for the learnable sign to ensure training stability. Extensive experiments on various modern models and tasks demonstrate that SSVQ achieves a significantly superior compression-accuracy trade-off compared to conventional VQ. Furthermore, we validate our algorithm on a hardware accelerator, showing that SSVQ achieves a 3$\times$ speedup over the 8-bit compressed model by reducing memory access. Our code is available at https://github.com/list0830/SSVQ.</p></details> | ICCV'25 camera ready | [Code Link](https://github.com/list0830/SSVQ) |
| **[GQSA: Group Quantization and Sparsity for Accelerating Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17560v4)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model compression has emerged as a mainstream solution to reduce memory usage and computational overhead. This paper presents Group Quantization and Sparse Acceleration (GQSA), a novel compression technique tailored for LLMs. Traditional methods typically focus exclusively on either quantization or sparsification, but relying on a single strategy often results in significant performance loss at high compression rates. In contrast, GQSA integrates quantization and sparsification in a tightly coupled manner, leveraging GPU-friendly structured group sparsity and quantization for efficient acceleration. Building upon system-algorithm co-design principles, we propose a two-stage sparse optimization strategy that ensures the performance superiority of the compressed model. On the engine side, we introduce a "task-centric" parallel strategy, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first application in the domain of sparse computing. Compared to the traditional 2:4 sparse method, the GQSA offers a more flexible and adjustable sparsity rate, as well as a higher weight compression rate, and is efficiently compatible with weight-only quantization methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, under the GQSA W4S50% compression setting, the model's accuracy surpasses that of both 2:4 pruning and W2 quantization. Furthermore, at the inference level, GQSA outperforms W2 by 1.26$\times$ and 2:4 pruning by 2.35$\times$ in terms of speed.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |
| **[ABQ-LLM: Arbitrary-Bit Quantized Inference Acceleration for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08554v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical application is constrained by substantial memory and computational demands. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered an effective method to accelerate LLM inference. Despite its growing popularity in LLM model compression, PTQ deployment faces two major challenges. First, low-bit quantization leads to performance degradation. Second, restricted by the limited integer computing unit type on GPUs, quantized matrix operations with different precisions cannot be effectively accelerated. To address these issues, we introduce a novel arbitrary-bit quantization algorithm and inference framework, ABQ-LLM. It achieves superior performance across various quantization settings and enables efficient arbitrary-precision quantized inference on the GPU. ABQ-LLM introduces several key innovations: (1) a distribution correction method for transformer blocks to mitigate distribution differences caused by full quantization of weights and activations, improving performance at low bit-widths. (2) the bit balance strategy to counteract performance degradation from asymmetric distribution issues at very low bit-widths (e.g., 2-bit). (3) an innovative quantization acceleration framework that reconstructs the quantization matrix multiplication of arbitrary precision combinations based on BTC (Binary TensorCore) equivalents, gets rid of the limitations of INT4/INT8 computing units. ABQ-LLM can convert each component bit width gain into actual acceleration gain, maximizing performance under mixed precision(e.g., W6A6, W2A8). Based on W2*A8 quantization configuration on LLaMA-7B model, it achieved a WikiText2 perplexity of 7.59 (2.17$\downarrow $ vs 9.76 in AffineQuant). Compared to SmoothQuant, we realized 1.6$\times$ acceleration improvement and 2.7$\times$ memory compression gain.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |
| **[Accelerating Parallel Diffusion Model Serving with Residual Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17511v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices, limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations, saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information. To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On 4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method. CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings, and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at https://github.com/Cobalt-27/CompactFusion</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Cobalt-27/CompactFusion) |

Users can access different compressed model versions according to their resources and budget. However, while existing compression operations primarily focus on optimizing the trade-off between resource efficiency and model performance, the privacy risks introduced by compression remain overlooked and insufficiently understood. In this work, through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA), we propose CompLeak, the first privacy risk evaluation framework examining three widely used compression configurations that are pruning, quantization, and weight clustering supported by the commercial model compression framework of Google's TensorFlow-Lite (TF-Lite) and Facebook's PyTorch Mobile. CompLeak has three variants, given available access to the number of compressed models and original model. CompLeakNR starts by adopting existing MIA methods to attack a single compressed model, and identifies that different compressed models influence members and non-members differently. When the original model and one compressed model are available, CompLeakSR leverages the compressed model as a reference to the original model and uncovers more privacy by combining meta information (e.g., confidence vector) from both models. When multiple compressed models are available with/without accessing the original model, CompLeakMR innovatively exploits privacy leakage info from multiple compressed versions to substantially signify the overall privacy leakage. We conduct extensive experiments on seven diverse model architectures (from ResNet to foundation models of BERT and GPT-2), and six image and textual benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their 1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge \underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness; 2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15 real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides, PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost, indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained devices.</p></details> | Accepted via KDD-25 | None |
| **[Compress Any Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08765v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 tables, 8 figures</p></details> | None |

The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition originated from the observed behaviour in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed projections, via so-called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appears in iterative fashion and acts as a smart neural architecture search, The experiments demonstrated the utility of this dual-tomography producing state-of-the-art performance with efficient compression during training, accelerating and supporting lottery ticket hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from statistical physics perspective, we formulated the so-called {\it Gibbs randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression relationship via Gibbs entropy. Practically, the DTC framework provides a promising approach for massively energy- and resource-efficient deep learning training.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures | None |

Although quantization paves a way for model compression and acceleration, existing methods face challenges in achieving low-bit quantization efficiently. In this paper, we identify imbalanced activation distributions as a primary source of quantization difficulty, and propose to adjust these distributions through weight finetuning to be more quantization-friendly. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while enhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across three high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple bit-width settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible, here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders. With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under 1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3) alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT, yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Quantization is a key technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the 4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose EoRA, a novel fine-tuning-free method that augments compressed LLMs with low-rank matrices, allowing users to rapidly enhance task-specific performance and freely balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational overhead beyond the constraints of compression formats. EoRA consistently outperforms prior training-free low rank methods in recovering the accuracy of compressed LLMs, achieving notable accuracy improvements (e.g., $\mathbf{10.84\%}$ on ARC-Challenge, $\mathbf{6.74\%}$ on MathQA, and $\mathbf{6.74\%}$ on GSM8K) for LLaMA3-8B compressed to 3-bit. We also introduce an optimized CUDA kernel, accelerating inference by up to 1.4x and reducing memory overhead through quantizing EoRA. Overall, EoRA offers a prompt solution for improving the accuracy of compressed models under varying user requirements, enabling more efficient and flexible deployment of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/EoRA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/NVlabs/EoRA) |

However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless separator tokens (i.e., punctuations) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional compression methods such as pruning, distillation, and low-rank approximation focus on reducing the effective number of neurons in the network, while quantization focuses on reducing the numerical precision of individual weights to reduce the model size while keeping the number of neurons fixed. While these compression methods have been relatively successful in practice, there is no compelling reason to believe that truncating the number of neurons is an optimal strategy. In this context, this paper introduces CompactifAI, an innovative LLM compression approach using quantum-inspired Tensor Networks that focuses on the model's correlation space instead, allowing for a more controlled, refined and interpretable model compression. Our method is versatile and can be implemented with - or on top of - other compression techniques. As a benchmark, we demonstrate that a combination of CompactifAI with quantization allows to reduce a 93% the memory size of LlaMA 7B, reducing also 70% the number of parameters, accelerating 50% the training and 25% the inference times of the model, and just with a small accuracy drop of 2% - 3%, going much beyond of what is achievable today by other compression techniques. Our methods also allow to perform a refined layer sensitivity profiling, showing that deeper layers tend to be more suitable for tensor network compression, which is compatible with recent observations on the ineffectiveness of those layers for LLM performance. Our results imply that standard LLMs are, in fact, heavily overparametrized, and do not need to be large at all.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, and supplementary information of 2 pages and 1 figure.

Recent advancements in AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However, existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1) text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2) unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for lower-quality images.

In this work, we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (BackSlash), a novel training-time compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). BackSlash enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity, significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance. Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that BackSlash can reduce memory usage by 60% - 90% without accuracy loss and provides significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover, BackSlash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining accuracy even at 80% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for accelerated inference on edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |

As DNNs and datasets grow, distributed training becomes extremely time-consuming and demands larger clusters. A main bottleneck is the resulting gradient aggregation overhead. While gradient compression and sparse collective communication techniques are commonly employed to alleviate network load, many gradient compression schemes do not achieve acceleration of the training process while also preserving accuracy. This paper introduces PacTrain, a novel framework that accelerates distributed training by combining pruning with sparse gradient compression. Active pruning of the neural network makes the model weights and gradients sparse. By ensuring the global knowledge of the gradient sparsity among all distributed training workers, we can perform lightweight compression communication without harming accuracy. We show that the PacTrain compression scheme achieves a near-optimal compression strategy while remaining compatible with the all-reduce primitive. Experimental evaluations show that PacTrain improves training throughput by 1.25 to 8.72 times compared to state-of-the-art compression-enabled systems for representative vision and language models training tasks under bandwidth-constrained conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper takes a step forward in accelerating the training of LIC methods by modeling the neural training dynamics. We first propose a Sensitivity-aware True and Dummy Embedding Training mechanism (STDET) that clusters LIC model parameters into few separate modes where parameters are expressed as affine transformations of reference parameters within the same mode. By further utilizing the stable intra-mode correlations throughout training and parameter sensitivities, we gradually embed non-reference parameters, reducing the number of trainable parameters. Additionally, we incorporate a Sampling-then-Moving Average (SMA) technique, interpolating sampled weights from stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training to obtain the moving average weights, ensuring smooth temporal behavior and minimizing training state variances. Overall, our method significantly reduces training space dimensions and the number of trainable parameters without sacrificing model performance, thus accelerating model convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the Noisy quadratic model, showing that the proposed method achieves a lower training variance than standard SGD. Our approach offers valuable insights for further developing efficient training methods for LICs.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR | None |

To mitigate these issues, there has been a concerted effort in post-hoc neural network pruning techniques that do not require costly retraining. Despite the considerable progress being made, existing methods often exhibit a steady drop in model performance as the compression increases. In this paper, we present a novel approach to compressing large transformers, coined OATS, that utilizes the second moment information in the input embeddings to decompose the model weights into a sum of sparse and low-rank matrices. Without any retraining, OATS achieves state-of-the-art performance when compressing models by up to $60\%$ on large language models such as Llama-3 and Phi-3 and vision transformers such as ViT and DINOv2 while delivering up to $1.37\times$ the CPU acceleration versus a model that was comparably pruned.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

Token reduction techniques that compress models by sharing the denoising process among similar tokens have been introduced. However, existing approaches neglect the denoising priors of the diffusion models, leading to suboptimal acceleration and diminished image quality. This study proposes a novel concept: attend to prune feature redundancies in areas not attended by the diffusion process. We analyze the location and degree of feature redundancies based on the structure-then-detail denoising priors. Subsequently, we introduce SDTM, a structure-then-detail token merging approach that dynamically compresses feature redundancies. Specifically, we design dynamic visual token merging, compression ratio adjusting, and prompt reweighting for different stages. Served in a post-training way, the proposed method can be integrated seamlessly into any DiT architecture.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a key optimization algorithm, plays a central role in this process. However, communication bottlenecks often limit scalability and efficiency, leading to increasing adoption of compressed SGD techniques to alleviate these challenges. Despite addressing communication overheads, compressed SGD introduces trustworthiness concerns, as gradient exchanges among nodes are vulnerable to attacks like gradient inversion (GradInv) and membership inference attacks (MIA). The trustworthiness of compressed SGD remains unexplored, leaving important questions about its reliability unanswered. In this paper, we provide a trustworthiness evaluation of compressed versus uncompressed SGD. Specifically, we conducted empirical studies using GradInv attacks, revealing that compressed SGD demonstrates significantly higher resistance to privacy leakage compared to uncompressed SGD. In addition, our findings suggest that MIA may not be a reliable metric for assessing privacy risks in distributed learning.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a physics-aware in-situ compression method using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to approximate electron and ion velocity distribution functions with a number of Gaussian components. This GMM-based method allows us to capture plasma features such as mean velocity and temperature, and it enables us to identify heating processes and generate beams. We first construct a histogram to reduce computational overhead and apply GPU-accelerated, in-situ GMM fitting within iPIC3D, a large-scale implicit Particle-in-Cell simulator, ensuring real-time compression. The compressed representation is stored using the ADIOS 2 library, thus optimizing the I/O process. The GPU and histogramming implementation provides a significant speed-up with respect to GMM on particles (both in time and required memory at run-time), enabling real-time compression. Compared to algorithms like SZ, MGARD, and BLOSC2, our GMM-based method has a physics-based approach, retaining the physical interpretation of plasma phenomena such as beam formation, acceleration, and heating mechanisms.

However, SRAM CIM faces limitations in executing larger models due to its cell size and on-chip memory constraints. This work proposes CIMPool, a CIM-aware compression and acceleration framework that counters this limitation through a weight sharing-based compression technique, aptly named `Weight Pool,' enabling significantly larger neural networks to be accommodated within on-chip memory constraints. This method minimizes the accuracy trade-off typically associated with parameter compression, allowing CIMPool to achieve a significantly larger compression ratio compared to the traditional quantization method with iso-accuracy. Furthermore, CIMPool co-optimizes the compression algorithm, hardware, and dataflow to efficiently implement the hardware permutation required by weight pool compression, with negligible area and throughput overhead. Empirical results demonstrate that CIMPool can achieve 8-bit level accuracy with an effective 0.5-bit precision, reduce chip area by 62.3% for ResNet-18, and enable the execution of an order of magnitude larger models for a given area budget in SRAM CIMs. When DRAM is used to store weights, CIMPool can reduce the total energy by 3.24x compared to iso-accuracy traditional CIMs.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, these models often face significant computational bottlenecks, particularly in attention mechanisms, which hinder their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DiTFastAttnV2, a post-training compression method designed to accelerate attention in MMDiT. Through an in-depth analysis of MMDiT's attention patterns, we identify key differences from prior DiT-based methods and propose head-wise arrow attention and caching mechanisms to dynamically adjust attention heads, effectively bridging this gap. We also design an Efficient Fused Kernel for further acceleration. By leveraging local metric methods and optimization techniques, our approach significantly reduces the search time for optimal compression schemes to just minutes while maintaining generation quality. Furthermore, with the customized kernel, DiTFastAttnV2 achieves a 68% reduction in attention FLOPs and 1.5x end-to-end speedup on 2K image generation without compromising visual fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as sequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their high computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and hardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review that systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains lacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of model compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and hardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging research directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The goal is to inspire further research with a contemporary guide on optimizing ViTs for efficient deployment on edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the limited eFPGA logic and memory significantly constrain compute capabilities and model size. As such, ML application deployment on eFPGAs is in direct contrast with the most recent FPGA approaches developing architecture-specific implementations and maximizing throughput over resource frugality. This paper focuses on the opposite side of this trade-off: the proposed eFPGA accelerator focuses on minimizing resource usage and allowing flexibility for on-field recalibration over throughput. This allows for runtime changes in model size, architecture, and input data dimensionality without offline resynthesis. This is made possible through the use of a bitwise compressed inference architecture of the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm. TM compute does not require any multiplication operations, being limited to only bitwise AND, OR, NOT, summations and additions. Additionally, TM model compression allows the entire model to fit within the on-chip block RAM of the eFPGA. The paper uses this accelerator to propose a strategy for runtime model tuning in the field. The proposed approach uses 2.5x fewer Look-up-Tables (LUTs) and 3.38x fewer registers than the current most resource-fugal design and achieves up to 129x energy reduction compared with low-power microcontrollers running the same ML application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by the 2025 EDGE AI FOUNDATION Austin</p></details> | None |

In baseline experiments, random-k compression results in severe performance degradation, highlighting its inefficacy. In contrast, using top-k and DGC at 50 times compression yields performance improvements, reducing perplexity by up to 0.06 compared to baseline. Experiments across 1, 2, and 4 workers demonstrate that conservative sparsification can have a regularizing effect, especially for smaller models, while compression ratios above 5000 times impair performance, particularly for DGC. Communication times are reduced across all compression methods, with top-k and DGC decreasing communication to negligible levels at high compression ratios. However, increased computation times offset this efficiency for top-k due to sorting demands, making it less scalable than DGC or QSGD. In convergence tests, sparsification techniques show accelerated convergence, requiring fewer epochs than the baseline, which has implications for computational savings. Although precision trade-offs emerge, floating point errors are mitigated by compression. This study's findings underscore the need to tune hyperparameters specifically for each compression technique to achieve optimal model performance, especially in distributed training systems.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, we propose an efficient, training-free prompt compression method that retains key information within compressed prompts. We identify specific attention heads in transformer-based LLMs, which we designate as evaluator heads, that are capable of selecting tokens in long inputs that are most significant for inference. Building on this discovery, we develop EHPC, an Evaluator Head-based Prompt Compression method, which enables LLMs to rapidly "skim through" input prompts by leveraging only the first few layers with evaluator heads during the pre-filling stage, subsequently passing only the important tokens to the model for inference. EHPC achieves state-of-the-art results across two mainstream benchmarks: prompt compression and long-context inference acceleration. Consequently, it effectively reduces the complexity and costs associated with commercial API calls. We further demonstrate that EHPC attains competitive results compared to key-value cache-based acceleration methods, thereby highlighting its potential to enhance the efficiency of LLMs for long-context tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

As linear layers in LLMs are mainly resource consuming parts, this paper develops a tensor-train decomposition (TTD) for LLMs with a further hardware implementation on FPGA. TTD compression is applied to the linear layers in ChatGLM3-6B and LLaMA2-7B models with compression ratios (CRs) for the whole network 1.94$\times$ and 1.60$\times$, respectively. The compressed LLMs are further implemented on FPGA hardware within a highly efficient group vector systolic array (GVSA) architecture, which has DSP-shared parallel vector PEs for TTD inference, as well as optimized data communication in the accelerator. Experimental results show that the corresponding TTD based LLM accelerator implemented on FPGA achieves 1.45$\times$ and 1.57$\times$ reduction in first token delay for ChatGLM3-6B and LLaMA2-7B models, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

In this article, we introduce DiffVC, a diffusion-based perceptual neural video compression framework that effectively integrates foundational diffusion model with the video conditional coding paradigm. This framework uses temporal context from previously decoded frame and the reconstructed latent representation of the current frame to guide the diffusion model in generating high-quality results. To accelerate the iterative inference process of diffusion model, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Information Reuse (TDIR) strategy, which significantly enhances inference efficiency with minimal performance loss by reusing the diffusion information from previous frames. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by distortion differences across various bitrates, we propose the Quantization Parameter-based Prompting (QPP) mechanism, which utilizes quantization parameters as prompts fed into the foundational diffusion model to explicitly modulate intermediate features, thereby enabling a robust variable bitrate diffusion-based neural compression framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution delivers excellent performance in both perception metrics and visual quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lillama: Large Language Models Compression via Low-Rank Feature Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16719v2)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM structured pruning methods typically involve two steps: (1) compression with calibration data and (2) costly continued pretraining on billions of tokens to recover lost performance. This second step is necessary as the first significantly impacts model accuracy. Prior research suggests pretrained Transformer weights aren't inherently low-rank, unlike their activations, which may explain this drop. Based on this observation, we propose Lillama, a compression method that locally distills activations with low-rank weights. Using SVD for initialization and a joint loss combining teacher and student activations, we accelerate convergence and reduce memory use with local gradient updates. Lillama compresses Mixtral-8x7B within minutes on a single A100 GPU, removing 10 billion parameters while retaining over 95% of its original performance. Phi-2 3B can be compressed by 40% with just 13 million calibration tokens, resulting in a small model that competes with recent models of similar size. The method generalizes well to non-transformer architectures, compressing Mamba-3B by 20% while maintaining 99% performance.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures | None |

However, conventional VQ techniques lead to significant accuracy loss because the important weights are not well preserved. To tackle this problem, a novel approach called MVQ is proposed, which aims at better approximating important weights with a limited number of codewords. At the algorithm level, our approach removes the less important weights through N:M pruning and then minimizes the vector clustering error between the remaining weights and codewords by the masked k-means algorithm. Only distances between the unpruned weights and the codewords are computed, which are then used to update the codewords. At the architecture level, our accelerator implements vector quantization on an EWS (Enhanced weight stationary) CNN accelerator and proposes a sparse systolic array design to maximize the benefits brought by masked vector quantization.\\ Our algorithm is validated on various models for image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MVQ not only outperforms conventional vector quantization methods at comparable compression ratios but also reduces FLOPs. Under ASIC evaluation, our MVQ accelerator boosts energy efficiency by 2.3$\times$ and reduces the size of the systolic array by 55\% when compared with the base EWS accelerator. Compared to the previous sparse accelerators, MVQ achieves 1.73$\times$ higher energy efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASPLOS '25</p></details> | None |

However, despite their impressive capabilities, the substantial computational costs of these large-scale models pose significant challenges for real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution, enabling model compression and accelerated inference for pretrained models, without the costly retraining. However, research on DiT quantization remains sparse, and existing PTQ frameworks, primarily designed for traditional diffusion models, tend to suffer from biased quantization, leading to notable performance degradation. In this work, we identify that DiTs typically exhibit significant spatial variance in both weights and activations, along with temporal variance in activations. To address these issues, we propose Q-DiT, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates two key techniques: automatic quantization granularity allocation to handle the significant variance of weights and activations across input channels, and sample-wise dynamic activation quantization to adaptively capture activation changes across both timesteps and samples. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and VBench demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-DiT. Specifically, when quantizing DiT-XL/2 to W6A8 on ImageNet ($256 \times 256$), Q-DiT achieves a remarkable reduction in FID by 1.09 compared to the baseline. Under the more challenging W4A8 setting, it maintains high fidelity in image and video generation, establishing a new benchmark for efficient, high-quality quantization in DiTs.

Therefore, data compression is essential for meteorological research, but an efficient compression scheme capable of keeping high accuracy with high compressibility is still lacking. As an emerging technique, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has recently acquired impressive momentum and demonstrates high promise for compressing diverse natural data. However, the INR-based compression encounters a bottleneck due to the sophisticated spatio-temporal properties and variability. To address this issue, we propose Hierarchical Harmonic decomposition implicit neural compression (HiHa) for atmospheric data. HiHa firstly segments the data into multi-frequency signals through decomposition of multiple complex harmonic, and then tackles each harmonic respectively with a frequency-based hierarchical compression module consisting of sparse storage, multi-scale INR and iterative decomposition sub-modules. We additionally design a temporal residual compression module to accelerate compression by utilizing temporal continuity. Experiments depict that HiHa outperforms both mainstream compressors and other INR-based methods in both compression fidelity and capabilities, and also demonstrate that using compressed data in existing data-driven models can achieve the same accuracy as raw data.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their high computational cost and memory footprint hinder their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Conventional pruning approaches can only compress and accelerate the MSA module using head pruning, although the head is not an atomic unit. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-aware neuron-level pruning method, Structured Neuron-level Pruning (SNP). SNP prunes neurons with less informative attention scores and eliminates redundancy among heads. Specifically, it prunes graphically connected query and key layers having the least informative attention scores while preserving the overall attention scores. Value layers, which can be pruned independently, are pruned to eliminate inter-head redundancy. Our proposed method effectively compresses and accelerates Transformer-based models for both edge devices and server processors. For instance, the DeiT-Small with SNP runs 3.1$\times$ faster than the original model and achieves performance that is 21.94\% faster and 1.12\% higher than the DeiT-Tiny. Additionally, SNP combine successfully with conventional head or block pruning approaches. SNP with head pruning could compress the DeiT-Base by 80\% of the parameters and computational costs and achieve 3.85$\times$ faster inference speed on RTX3090 and 4.93$\times$ on Jetson Nano.</p></details> |  | None |

Numerous efficient techniques, including weight pruning, quantization, and distillation, have been embraced to compress LLMs, targeting memory reduction and inference acceleration, which underscore the redundancy in LLMs. However, most model compression techniques concentrate on weight optimization, overlooking the exploration of optimal architectures. Besides, traditional architecture search methods, limited by the elevated complexity with extensive parameters, struggle to demonstrate their effectiveness on LLMs. In this paper, we propose a training-free architecture search framework to identify optimal subnets that preserve the fundamental strengths of the original LLMs while achieving inference acceleration. Furthermore, after generating subnets that inherit specific weights from the original LLMs, we introduce a reformation algorithm that utilizes the omitted weights to rectify the inherited weights with a small amount of calibration data. Compared with SOTA training-free structured pruning works that can generate smaller networks, our method demonstrates superior performance across standard benchmarks.

A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and accessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts, such as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are effective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs yields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache, a novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In this paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention by distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based on these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache budget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget across different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to better evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy comparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method accelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and speeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV cache in GPU by 90%.</p></details> |  | None |

By parameterizing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as neural network layers, these Neural ODEs are memory-efficient to train, process time-series naturally and incorporate knowledge of physical systems into deep learning models. However, the practical applications of Neural ODEs are limited due to long inference times, because the outputs of the embedded ODE layers are computed numerically with differential equation solvers that can be computationally demanding. Here we show that mathematical model order reduction methods can be used for compressing and accelerating Neural ODEs by accurately simulating the continuous nonlinear dynamics in low-dimensional subspaces. We implement our novel compression method by developing Neural ODEs that integrate the necessary subspace-projection and interpolation operations as layers of the neural network. We validate our approach by comparing it to neuron pruning and SVD-based weight truncation methods from the literature in image and time-series classification tasks. The methods are evaluated by acceleration versus accuracy when adjusting the level of compression. On this spectrum, we achieve a favourable balance over existing methods by using model order reduction when compressing a convolutional Neural ODE. In compressing a recurrent Neural ODE, SVD-based weight truncation yields good performance. Based on our results, our integration of model order reduction with Neural ODEs can facilitate efficient, dynamical system-driven deep learning in resource-constrained applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

The key and value storage of the attention map in the KV (key-value) cache accounts for more than 80\% of this memory consumption. Nowadays, most existing KV cache compression methods focus on intra-layer compression within a single Transformer layer but few works consider layer-wise compression. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play method called \textit{KVSharer}, which shares the KV cache between layers to achieve layer-wise compression. Rather than intuitively sharing based on higher similarity, we discover a counterintuitive phenomenon: sharing dissimilar KV caches better preserves the model performance. Experiments show that \textit{KVSharer} can reduce KV cache computation by 30\%, thereby lowering memory consumption without significantly impacting model performance and it can also achieve at least 1.3 times generation acceleration. Additionally, we verify that \textit{KVSharer} is compatible with existing intra-layer KV cache compression methods, and combining both can further save memory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review by ICLR2025</p></details> | None |

To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios, achieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory costs for KV cache.

Most existing $N{:}M$ sparsity methods compress neural networks with a uniform setting for all layers in a network or heuristically determine the layer-wise configuration by considering the number of parameters in each layer. However, very few methods have been designed for obtaining a layer-wise customized $N{:}M$ sparse configuration for vision transformers (ViTs), which usually consist of transformer blocks involving the same number of parameters. In this work, to address the challenge of selecting suitable sparse configuration for ViTs on $N{:}M$ sparsity-supporting accelerators, we propose ELSA, Exploiting Layer-wise $N{:}M$ Sparsity for ViTs. Considering not only all $N{:}M$ sparsity levels supported by a given accelerator but also the expected throughput improvement, our methodology can reap the benefits of accelerators supporting mixed sparsity by trading off negligible accuracy loss with both memory usage and inference time reduction for ViT models. For instance, our approach achieves a noteworthy 2.9$\times$ reduction in FLOPs for both Swin-B and DeiT-B with only a marginal degradation of accuracy on ImageNet.

However, these approaches rely on data-intensive communication routines to collect, aggregate, and re-distribute gradients, activations, and other important model information, which pose significant overhead. Co-designed with GPU-based compression libraries, MPI libraries have been proven to reduce message size significantly, and leverage interconnect bandwidth, thus increasing training efficiency while maintaining acceptable accuracy. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of compression-assisted MPI collectives under the context of distributed LLM training using 3D parallelism and ZeRO optimizations. We scaled up to 192 V100 GPUs on the Lassen supercomputer. First, we enabled a naïve compression scheme across all collectives and observed a 22.5\% increase in TFLOPS per GPU and a 23.6\% increase in samples per second for GPT-NeoX-20B training. Nonetheless, such a strategy ignores the sparsity discrepancy among messages communicated in each parallelism degree, thus introducing more errors and causing degradation in training loss. Therefore, we incorporated hybrid compression settings toward each parallel dimension and adjusted the compression intensity accordingly. Given their low-rank structure (arXiv:2301.02654), we apply aggressive compression on gradients when performing DP All-reduce. We adopt milder compression to preserve precision while communicating activations, optimizer states, and model parameters in TP and PP. Using the adjusted hybrid compression scheme, we demonstrate a 17.3\% increase in TFLOPS per GPU and a 12.7\% increase in samples per second while reaching baseline loss convergence.</p></details> |  | None |

To accelerate model inference and reduce costs, we propose an innovative prompt compression framework called LanguaShrink. Inspired by the observation that LLM performance depends on the density and position of key information in the input prompts, LanguaShrink leverages psycholinguistic principles and the Ebbinghaus memory curve to achieve task-agnostic prompt compression. This effectively reduces prompt length while preserving essential information. We referred to the training method of OpenChat.The framework introduces part-of-speech priority compression and data distillation techniques, using smaller models to learn compression targets and employing a KL-regularized reinforcement learning strategy for training.\cite{wang2023openchat} Additionally, we adopt a chunk-based compression algorithm to achieve adjustable compression rates. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, including LongBench, ZeroScrolls, Arxiv Articles, and a newly constructed novel test set.

| **[Enhancing and Accelerating Large Language Models via Instruction-Aware Contextual Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15491v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their remarkable performance across various tasks. However, to mitigate the issue of hallucinations, LLMs often incorporate retrieval-augmented pipeline to provide them with rich external knowledge and context. Nevertheless, challenges stem from inaccurate and coarse-grained context retrieved from the retriever. Supplying irrelevant context to the LLMs can result in poorer responses, increased inference latency, and higher costs. This paper introduces a method called Instruction-Aware Contextual Compression, which filters out less informative content, thereby accelerating and enhancing the use of LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that Instruction-Aware Contextual Compression notably reduces memory consumption and minimizes generation latency while maintaining performance levels comparable to those achieved with the use of the full context. Specifically, we achieved a 50% reduction in context-related costs, resulting in a 5% reduction in inference memory usage and a 2.2-fold increase in inference speed, with only a minor drop of 0.047 in Rouge-1. These findings suggest that our method strikes an effective balance between efficiency and performance.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |
| **[Bandwidth-Aware and Overlap-Weighted Compression for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14736v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current data compression methods, such as sparsification in Federated Averaging (FedAvg), effectively enhance the communication efficiency of Federated Learning (FL). However, these methods encounter challenges such as the straggler problem and diminished model performance due to heterogeneous bandwidth and non-IID (Independently and Identically Distributed) data. To address these issues, we introduce a bandwidth-aware compression framework for FL, aimed at improving communication efficiency while mitigating the problems associated with non-IID data. First, our strategy dynamically adjusts compression ratios according to bandwidth, enabling clients to upload their models at a close pace, thus exploiting the otherwise wasted time to transmit more data. Second, we identify the non-overlapped pattern of retained parameters after compression, which results in diminished client update signals due to uniformly averaged weights. Based on this finding, we propose a parameter mask to adjust the client-averaging coefficients at the parameter level, thereby more closely approximating the original updates, and improving the training convergence under heterogeneous environments. Our evaluations reveal that our method significantly boosts model accuracy, with a maximum improvement of 13% over the uncompressed FedAvg. Moreover, it achieves a $3.37\times$ speedup in reaching the target accuracy compared to FedAvg with a Top-K compressor, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating convergence with compression. The integration of common compression techniques into our framework further establishes its potential as a versatile foundation for future cross-device, communication-efficient FL research, addressing critical challenges in FL and advancing the field of distributed machine learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LLMLingua-2: Data Distillation for Efficient and Faithful Task-Agnostic Prompt Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12968v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency. Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective. To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context. Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT. We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs. Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.

| **[Non-Vacuous Generalization Bounds for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17173v3)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models can contain billions of parameters, raising the question of whether they can generalize beyond the training data or simply parrot their training corpora. We provide the first non-vacuous generalization bounds for pretrained large language models (LLMs), indicating that language models are capable of discovering regularities that generalize to unseen data. In particular, we derive a compression bound that is valid for the unbounded log-likelihood loss using prediction smoothing, and we extend the bound to handle subsampling, accelerating bound computation by orders of magnitude on massive datasets. To achieve the extreme level of compression required for non-vacuous bounds, we devise SubLoRA, a simple low-dimensional nonlinear parameterization that leads to non-vacuous generalization bounds for models with nearly a billion parameters. Finally, we use our bounds to understand LLM generalization and find that larger models have better generalization bounds and are more compressible than smaller models.</p></details> | ICML 2024 | None |
| **[Unlocking Data-free Low-bit Quantization with Matrix Decomposition for KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12591v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Key-value~(KV) caching is an important technique to accelerate the inference of large language models~(LLMs), but incurs significant memory overhead. To compress the size of KV cache, existing methods often compromise precision or require extra data for calibration, limiting their practicality in LLM deployment. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{DecoQuant}, a novel data-free low-bit quantization technique based on tensor decomposition methods, to effectively compress KV cache. Our core idea is to adjust the outlier distribution of the original matrix by performing tensor decomposition, so that the quantization difficulties are migrated from the matrix to decomposed local tensors. Specially, we find that outliers mainly concentrate on small local tensors, while large tensors tend to have a narrower value range. Based on this finding, we propose to apply low-bit quantization to the large tensor, while maintaining high-precision representation for the small tensor. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed quantization method to compress the KV cache of LLMs to accelerate the inference and develop an efficient dequantization kernel tailored specifically for DecoQuant. Through extensive experiments, DecoQuant demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains, showcasing up to a $\sim$75\% reduction in memory footprint while maintaining comparable generation quality.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, deploying them brings significant challenges due to the huge cost of memory, energy, and computation. To address these challenges, researchers have developed various model compression techniques such as model quantization and model pruning. Recently, there has been a surge in research of compression methods to achieve model efficiency while retaining the performance. Furthermore, more and more works focus on customizing the DNN hardware accelerators to better leverage the model compression techniques. In addition to efficiency, preserving security and privacy is critical for deploying DNNs. However, the vast and diverse body of related works can be overwhelming. This inspires us to conduct a comprehensive survey on recent research toward the goal of high-performance, cost-efficient, and safe deployment of DNNs. Our survey first covers the mainstream model compression techniques such as model quantization, model pruning, knowledge distillation, and optimizations of non-linear operations. We then introduce recent advances in designing hardware accelerators that can adapt to efficient model compression approaches. Additionally, we discuss how homomorphic encryption can be integrated to secure DNN deployment. Finally, we discuss several issues, such as hardware evaluation, generalization, and integration of various compression approaches. Overall, we aim to provide a big picture of efficient DNNs, from algorithm to hardware accelerators and security perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is the accepted version for TNNLS(IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems)</p></details> | None |

On the algorithm side, the ultimate goal of quantization or pruning is accelerating the expensive DNN computations on low-power hardware. However, such a "design-and-deploy" workflow faces under-explored challenges in the current hardware-algorithm co-design community. First, although the state-of-the-art quantization algorithm can achieve low precision with negligible degradation of accuracy, the latest deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch) can only support non-customizable 8-bit precision, data format, and parameter extraction. Secondly, the objective of quantization is to enable the computation with low-precision data. However, the current SoTA algorithm treats the quantized integer as an intermediate result, while the final output of the quantizer is the "discretized" floating-point values, ignoring the practical needs and adding additional workload to hardware designers for integer parameter extraction and layer fusion. Finally, the compression toolkits designed by the industry are constrained to their in-house product or a handful of algorithms. The limited degree of freedom in the current toolkit and the under-explored customization hinder the prototype ASIC or FPGA-based accelerator design. To resolve these challenges, we propose Torch2Chip, an open-sourced, fully customizable, and high-performance toolkit that supports user-designed compression followed by automatic model fusion and parameter extraction. Torch2Chip incorporates the hierarchical design workflow, and the user-customized compression algorithm will be directly packed into the deployment-ready format for prototype chip verification with either CNN or vision transformer (ViT).

As DNNs and datasets get larger, they require distributed training on increasingly larger clusters. A main bottleneck is the resulting communication overhead where workers exchange model updates (i.e., gradients) on a per-round basis. To address this bottleneck and accelerate training, a widely-deployed approach is compression. However, previous deployments often apply bi-directional compression schemes by simply using a uni-directional gradient compression scheme in each direction. This results in significant computational overheads at the parameter server and increased compression error, leading to longer training and lower accuracy. We introduce Tensor Homomorphic Compression (THC), a novel bi-directional compression framework that enables the direct aggregation of compressed values and thus eliminating the aforementioned computational overheads. Moreover, THC is compatible with in-network aggregation (INA), which allows for further acceleration. Our evaluation shows that training representative vision and language models with THC reaches target accuracy by 1.40x to 1.47x faster using INA and 1.28x to 1.33x faster using a software PS compared with state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages body, 21 pages total</p></details> | None |

Unlike the hand-engineered transforms in the classical frameworks, NN-based models learn the non-linear transforms providing more compact bit representations, and achieve faster coding speed on parallel devices over their classical counterparts. Those properties evoked the attention of both scientific and industrial communities, resulting in the standardization activity JPEG-AI. The verification model for the standardization process of JPEG-AI is already in development and has surpassed the advanced VVC intra codec. To generate reconstructed images with the desired bits per pixel and assess the BD-rate performance of both the JPEG-AI verification model and VVC intra, bit rate matching is employed. However, the current state of the JPEG-AI verification model experiences significant slowdowns during bit rate matching, resulting in suboptimal performance due to an unsuitable model. The proposed methodology offers a gradual algorithmic optimization for matching bit rates, resulting in a fourfold acceleration and over 1% improvement in BD-rate at the base operation point. At the high operation point, the acceleration increases up to sixfold.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at (IEEE) PCS 2024; 6 pages</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose Variator, a parameter-efficient acceleration method that enhances computational efficiency through plug-and-play compression plugins. Compression plugins are designed to reduce the sequence length via compressing multiple hidden vectors into one and trained with original PLMs frozen. Different from traditional model acceleration methods, which compress PLMs to smaller sizes, Variator offers two distinct advantages: (1) In real-world applications, the plug-and-play nature of our compression plugins enables dynamic selection of different compression plugins with varying acceleration ratios based on the current workload. (2) The compression plugin comprises a few compact neural network layers with minimal parameters, significantly saving storage and memory overhead, particularly in scenarios with a growing number of tasks. We validate the effectiveness of Variator on seven datasets. Experimental results show that Variator can save 53% computational costs using only 0.9% additional parameters with a performance drop of less than 2%. Moreover, when the model scales to billions of parameters, Variator matches the strong performance of uncompressed PLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of EMNLP</p></details> | None |

However, the significant memory and computational costs incurred during the inference process make it challenging to deploy large models on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we investigate compression and efficient inference methods for large language models from an algorithmic perspective. Regarding taxonomy, similar to smaller models, compression and acceleration algorithms for large language models can still be categorized into quantization, pruning, distillation, compact architecture design, dynamic networks. However, Large language models have two prominent characteristics compared to smaller models: (1) Most of compression algorithms require finetuning or even retraining the model after compression. The most notable aspect of large models is the very high cost associated with model finetuning or training. Therefore, many algorithms for large models, such as quantization and pruning, start to explore tuning-free algorithms. (2) Large models emphasize versatility and generalization rather than performance on a single task. Hence, many algorithms, such as knowledge distillation, focus on how to preserving their versatility and generalization after compression. Since these two characteristics were not very pronounced in early large models, we further distinguish large language models into medium models and ``real'' large models. Additionally, we also provide an introduction to some mature frameworks for efficient inference of large models, which can support basic compression or acceleration algorithms, greatly facilitating model deployment for users.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, review 380 papers.

| **[HALOC: Hardware-Aware Automatic Low-Rank Compression for Compact Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.09422v2)** | 2024-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank compression is an important model compression strategy for obtaining compact neural network models. In general, because the rank values directly determine the model complexity and model accuracy, proper selection of layer-wise rank is very critical and desired. To date, though many low-rank compression approaches, either selecting the ranks in a manual or automatic way, have been proposed, they suffer from costly manual trials or unsatisfied compression performance. In addition, all of the existing works are not designed in a hardware-aware way, limiting the practical performance of the compressed models on real-world hardware platforms. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose HALOC, a hardware-aware automatic low-rank compression framework. By interpreting automatic rank selection from an architecture search perspective, we develop an end-to-end solution to determine the suitable layer-wise ranks in a differentiable and hardware-aware way. We further propose design principles and mitigation strategy to efficiently explore the rank space and reduce the potential interference problem. Experimental results on different datasets and hardware platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. On CIFAR-10 dataset, HALOC enables 0.07% and 0.38% accuracy increase over the uncompressed ResNet-20 and VGG-16 models with 72.20% and 86.44% fewer FLOPs, respectively. On ImageNet dataset, HALOC achieves 0.9% higher top-1 accuracy than the original ResNet-18 model with 66.16% fewer FLOPs. HALOC also shows 0.66% higher top-1 accuracy increase than the state-of-the-art automatic low-rank compression solution with fewer computational and memory costs. In addition, HALOC demonstrates the practical speedups on different hardware platforms, verified by the measurement results on desktop GPU, embedded GPU and ASIC accelerator.</p></details> | AAAI-23 | None |

But despite rapidly growing research interests in learning-based image compression, no published method offers both lossless and near-lossless modes. In this paper, we propose a unified and powerful deep lossy plus residual (DLPR) coding framework for both lossless and near-lossless image compression. In the lossless mode, the DLPR coding system first performs lossy compression and then lossless coding of residuals. We solve the joint lossy and residual compression problem in the approach of VAEs, and add autoregressive context modeling of the residuals to enhance lossless compression performance. In the near-lossless mode, we quantize the original residuals to satisfy a given $\ell_\infty$ error bound, and propose a scalable near-lossless compression scheme that works for variable $\ell_\infty$ bounds instead of training multiple networks. To expedite the DLPR coding, we increase the degree of algorithm parallelization by a novel design of coding context, and accelerate the entropy coding with adaptive residual interval. Experimental results demonstrate that the DLPR coding system achieves both the state-of-the-art lossless and near-lossless image compression performance with competitive coding speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>manus...</summary><p>manuscript accepted by TPAMI, source code:https://github.com/BYchao100/Deep-Lossy-Plus-Residual-Coding</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/BYchao100/Deep-Lossy-Plus-Residual-Coding) |

However, most of the existing accelerators suffer from high power consumption and focus on image applications only. This paper presents a low power accelerator for speech separation through algorithm and hardware optimizations. At the algorithm level, the model is compressed with structured sensitivity as well as unstructured pruning, and further quantized to the shifted 8-bit floating-point format instead of the 32-bit floating-point format. The computations with the zero kernel and zero activation values are skipped by decomposition of the dilated and transposed convolutions. At the hardware level, the compressed model is then supported by an architecture with eight independent multipliers and accumulators (MACs) with a simple zero-skipping hardware to take advantage of the activation sparsity and low power processing. The proposed approach reduces the model size by 95.44\% and computation complexity by 93.88\%. The final implementation with the TSMC 40 $nm$ process can achieve real-time speech separation and consumes 1.6 mW power when operated at 150 MHz. The normalized energy efficiency and area efficiency are 2.344 TOPS/W and 14.42 GOPS/mm$^2$, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most of these neural networks are large and inefficient making it a barrier for deployment in practical wireless systems that require low-latency and low memory footprints for individual network functions. To mitigate these limitations, we propose accelerated and compressed efficient neural networks for massive MIMO CSI feedback. Specifically, we have thoroughly investigated the adoption of network pruning, post-training dynamic range quantization, and weight clustering to optimize CSI feedback compression for massive MIMO systems. Furthermore, we have deployed the proposed model compression techniques on commodity hardware and demonstrated that in order to achieve inference gains, specialized libraries that accelerate computations for sparse neural networks are required. Our findings indicate that there is remarkable value in applying these model compression techniques and the proposed joint pruning and quantization approach reduced model size by 86.5% and inference time by 76.2% with minimal impact to model accuracy. These compression methods are crucial to pave the way for practical adoption and deployments of deep learning-based techniques in commercial wireless systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE ICC 2023 Conference</p></details> | None |

To facilitate intelligent applications across edge devices, researchers have proposed partitioning a large model into several sub-models, and deploying each of them to a different edge device to collaboratively train a DNN model. However, the communication overhead caused by the large amount of data transmitted from one device to another during training, as well as the sub-optimal partition point due to the inaccurate latency prediction of computation at each edge device can significantly slow down training. In this paper, we propose AccEPT, an acceleration scheme for accelerating the edge collaborative pipeline-parallel training. In particular, we propose a light-weight adaptive latency predictor to accurately estimate the computation latency of each layer at different devices, which also adapts to unseen devices through continuous learning. Therefore, the proposed latency predictor leads to better model partitioning which balances the computation loads across participating devices. Moreover, we propose a bit-level computation-efficient data compression scheme to compress the data to be transmitted between devices during training. Our numerical results demonstrate that our proposed acceleration approach is able to significantly speed up edge pipeline parallel training up to 3 times faster in the considered experimental settings.</p></details> |  | None |

For example, the SwitchTransformer-c2048 model has 1.6 trillion parameters, requiring 3.2TB of accelerator memory to run efficiently, which makes practical deployment challenging and expensive. In this paper, we present a solution to this memory problem, in form of a new compression and execution framework called QMoE. Specifically, QMoE consists of a scalable algorithm which accurately compresses trillion-parameter MoEs to less than 1 bit per parameter, in a custom format co-designed with bespoke GPU decoding kernels to facilitate efficient end-to-end compressed inference, with minor runtime overheads relative to uncompressed execution. Concretely, QMoE can compress the 1.6 trillion parameter SwitchTransformer-c2048 model to less than 160GB (20x compression, 0.8 bits per parameter) at only minor accuracy loss, in less than a day on a single GPU. This enables, for the first time, the execution of a trillion-parameter model on affordable commodity hardware, like a single server with 4x NVIDIA A6000 or 8x NVIDIA 3090 GPUs, at less than 5% runtime overhead relative to ideal uncompressed inference.

Previous randomized algorithms exploit sparsity in PDE updates for acceleration. However such methods are applicable to a limited class of decomposable PDEs, which have sparse features in the value domain. We propose Reel, which accelerates the learning of PDEs via random projection and has much broader applicability. Reel exploits the sparsity by decomposing dense updates into sparse ones in both the value and frequency domains. This decomposition enables efficient learning when the source of the updates consists of gradually changing terms across large areas (sparse in the frequency domain) in addition to a few rapid updates concentrated in a small set of "interfacial" regions (sparse in the value domain). Random projection is then applied to compress the sparse signals for learning. To expand the model applicability, Taylor series expansion is used in Reel to approximate the nonlinear PDE updates with polynomials in the decomposable form. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation between the projected loss function and the original one with poly-logarithmic number of projected dimensions. Experimentally, we provide empirical evidence that our proposed Reel can lead to faster learning of PDE models (70-98% reduction in training time when the data is compressed to 1% of its original size) with comparable quality as the non-compressed models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their excessive overhead leads to large latency and computational costs. The statically compression methods allocate fixed computation to different samples, resulting in redundant computation. The dynamic token pruning method selectively shortens the sequences but are unable to change the model size and hardly achieve the speedups as static pruning. In this paper, we propose a model accelaration approaches for large language models that incorporates dynamic token downsampling and static pruning, optimized by the information bottleneck loss. Our model, Infor-Coef, achieves an 18x FLOPs speedup with an accuracy degradation of less than 8\% compared to BERT.

Specially, an original large model with dense weight parameters is first pruned into a sparse one by 2:4 structured pruning, which considers the GPU's acceleration of 2:4 structured sparse pattern with FP16 data type, then the floating-point sparse model is further quantized into a fixed-point one by sparse-distillation-aware quantization aware training, which considers GPU can provide an extra speedup of 2:4 sparse calculation with integer tensors. A mixed-strategy knowledge distillation is used during the pruning and quantization process. The proposed compression scheme is flexible to support supervised and unsupervised learning styles. Experiment results show GPUSQ-ViT scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression by reducing vision transformer models 6.4-12.7 times on model size and 30.3-62 times on FLOPs with negligible accuracy degradation on ImageNet classification, COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation benchmarking tasks. Moreover, GPUSQ-ViT can boost actual deployment performance by 1.39-1.79 times and 3.22-3.43 times of latency and throughput on A100 GPU, and 1.57-1.69 times and 2.11-2.51 times improvement of latency and throughput on AGX Orin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2023, 11 pages, 6 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Filter Pruning via Filters Similarity in Consecutive Layers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13397v1)** | 2023-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filter pruning is widely adopted to compress and accelerate the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but most previous works ignore the relationship between filters and channels in different layers. Processing each layer independently fails to utilize the collaborative relationship across layers. In this paper, we intuitively propose a novel pruning method by explicitly leveraging the Filters Similarity in Consecutive Layers (FSCL). FSCL compresses models by pruning filters whose corresponding features are more worthless in the model. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FSCL, and it yields remarkable improvement over state-of-the-art on accuracy, FLOPs and parameter reduction on several benchmark models and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2023 (oral)</p></details> | None |

They alternate local computations and two-way communication with a distant orchestrating server. Communication, which can be slow and costly, is the main bottleneck in this setting. To reduce the communication load and therefore accelerate distributed gradient descent, two strategies are popular: 1) communicate less frequently; that is, perform several iterations of local computations between the communication rounds; and 2) communicate compressed information instead of full-dimensional vectors. We propose the first algorithm for distributed optimization and federated learning, which harnesses these two strategies jointly and converges linearly to an exact solution in the strongly convex setting, with a doubly accelerated rate: our algorithm benefits from the two acceleration mechanisms provided by local training and compression, namely a better dependency on the condition number of the functions and on the dimension of the model, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

And the storage of gene data has become an important issue. Traditional gene data compression methods rely on general software like G-zip, which fails to utilize the interrelation of nucleotide sequence. Recently, many researchers begin to investigate deep learning based gene data compression method. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based gene compression method named GeneFormer. Specifically, we first introduce a modified transformer structure to fully explore the nucleotide sequence dependency. Then, we propose fixed-length parallel grouping to accelerate the decoding speed of our autoregressive model. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method saves 29.7% bit rate compared with the state-of-the-art method, and the decoding speed is significantly faster than all existing learning-based gene compression methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Hierarchy Quantization Compression algorithm based on Dynamic Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.14760v1)** | 2023-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike traditional distributed machine learning, federated learning stores data locally for training and then aggregates the models on the server, which solves the data security problem that may arise in traditional distributed machine learning. However, during the training process, the transmission of model parameters can impose a significant load on the network bandwidth. It has been pointed out that the vast majority of model parameters are redundant during model parameter transmission. In this paper, we explore the data distribution law of selected partial model parameters on this basis, and propose a deep hierarchical quantization compression algorithm, which further compresses the model and reduces the network load brought by data transmission through the hierarchical quantization of model parameters. And we adopt a dynamic sampling strategy for the selection of clients to accelerate the convergence of the model. Experimental results on different public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we implement a working prototype of a new distributed inference acceleration method HALP using three raspberry Pi 4. HALP accelerates inference by designing a seamless collaboration among edge devices (EDs) in Edge Computing. We maximize the parallelization between communication and computation among the collaborative EDs by optimizing the task partitioning ratio based on the segment-based partitioning. Experimental results show that the distributed inference HALP achieves 1.7x inference acceleration for VGG-16. Then, we combine distributed inference with conventional neural network model compression by setting up different shrinking hyperparameters for MobileNet-V1. In this way, we can further accelerate inference but at the cost of inference accuracy loss. To strike a balance between latency and accuracy, we propose dynamic model selection to select a model which provides the highest accuracy within the latency constraint. It is shown that the model selection with distributed inference HALP can significantly improve service reliability compared to the conventional stand-alone computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by European Wireless 2022</p></details> | None |

With the widespread use of mobile devices, neural network models based on platforms with low computing power are gradually being paid attention. However, due to the limitation of computing power, deep learning algorithms are usually not available on mobile devices. This paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network, TripleNet, which can operate easily on Raspberry Pi. Adopted from the concept of block connections in ThreshNet, the newly proposed network model compresses and accelerates the network model, reduces the amount of parameters of the network, and shortens the inference time of each image while ensuring the accuracy. Our proposed TripleNet and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) neural networks perform image classification experiments with the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets on Raspberry Pi. The experimental results show that, compared with GhostNet, MobileNet, ThreshNet, EfficientNet, and HarDNet, the inference time of TripleNet per image is shortened by 15%, 16%, 17%, 24%, and 30%, respectively.

For resource-constrained devices, there is an urgent need for a spatially and temporally efficient model which retains the major capacity of PLMs. However, existing statically compressed models are unaware of the diverse complexities between input instances, potentially resulting in redundancy and inadequacy for simple and complex inputs. Also, miniature models with early exiting encounter challenges in the trade-off between making predictions and serving the deeper layers. Motivated by such considerations, we propose a collaborative optimization for PLMs that integrates static model compression and dynamic inference acceleration. Specifically, the PLM is slenderized in width while the depth remains intact, complementing layer-wise early exiting to speed up inference dynamically. To address the trade-off of early exiting, we propose a joint training approach that calibrates slenderization and preserves contributive structures to each exit instead of only the final layer. Experiments are conducted on GLUE benchmark and the results verify the Pareto optimality of our approach at high compression and acceleration rate with 1/8 parameters and 1/19 FLOPs of BERT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2022 main conference</p></details> | None |

However, it is difficult to find a satisfactory compromise solution in a reasonable time due to the complexity of solution space searching. To solve this problem, we first formulate a multi-objective optimization problem based on a sub-network of the full model and propose a Sub-network Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (SMOEA) for filter pruning. By progressively pruning the convolutional layers in groups, SMOEA can obtain a lightweight pruned result with better performance.Experiments on VGG-14 model for CIFAR-10 verify the effectiveness of the proposed SMOEA. Specifically, the accuracy of the pruned model with 16.56% parameters decreases by 0.28% only, which is better than the widely used popular filter pruning criteria.</p></details> |  | None |

However, accelerating the model itself and achieving better inference efficiency through model compression has not been thoroughly explored yet. Model compression could provide the benefits of reducing memory footprints, enabling low-precision computations, and ultimately achieving cost-effective inference. To combine parameter-efficient adaptation and model compression, we propose AlphaTuning consisting of post-training quantization of the pre-trained language model and fine-tuning only some parts of quantized parameters for a target task. Specifically, AlphaTuning works by employing binary-coding quantization, which factorizes the full-precision parameters into binary parameters and a separate set of scaling factors. During the adaptation phase, the binary values are frozen for all tasks, while the scaling factors are fine-tuned for the downstream task. We demonstrate that AlphaTuning, when applied to GPT-2 and OPT, performs competitively with full fine-tuning on a variety of downstream tasks while achieving >10x compression ratio under 4-bit quantization and >1,000x reduction in the number of trainable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2022</p></details> | None |

However, this pipeline suffers from high computational cost and long inference latency, which largely depends on two essential factors: 1) network architecture parameters, 2) sequential data stream. Recently, the parameters of image-based generative models have been significantly compressed via more efficient network architectures. Nevertheless, existing methods mainly focus on slimming network architectures and ignore the size of the sequential data stream. Moreover, due to the lack of temporal coherence, image-based compression is not sufficient for the compression of the video task. In this paper, we present a spatial-temporal compression framework, \textbf{Fast-Vid2Vid}, which focuses on data aspects of generative models. It makes the first attempt at time dimension to reduce computational resources and accelerate inference. Specifically, we compress the input data stream spatially and reduce the temporal redundancy. After the proposed spatial-temporal knowledge distillation, our model can synthesize key-frames using the low-resolution data stream. Finally, Fast-Vid2Vid interpolates intermediate frames by motion compensation with slight latency. On standard benchmarks, Fast-Vid2Vid achieves around real-time performance as 20 FPS and saves around 8x computational cost on a single V100 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2022, Project Page: https://fast-vid2vid.github.io/ , Code: https://github.com/fast-vid2vid/fast-vid2vid</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/fast-vid2vid/fast-vid2vid) |

However, existing parallel I/O libraries cannot fully utilize lossy compression to accelerate parallel write due to the lack of deep understanding on compression-write performance. To this end, we propose to deeply integrate predictive lossy compression with HDF5 to significantly improve the parallel-write performance. Specifically, we propose analytical models to predict the time of compression and parallel write before the actual compression to enable compression-write overlapping. We also introduce an extra space in the process to handle possible data overflows resulting from prediction uncertainty in compression ratios. Moreover, we propose an optimization to reorder the compression tasks to increase the overlapping efficiency. Experiments with up to 4,096 cores from Summit show that our solution improves the write performance by up to 4.5X and 2.9X over the non-compression and lossy compression solutions, respectively, with only 1.5% storage overhead (compared to original data) on two real-world HPC applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 18 figures, accepted by ACM/IEEE SC'22</p></details> | None |

However, the throughput for most of them is less than 1 MB/s even with the most advanced AI accelerated chips, preventing them from most real-world applications, which often require 100 MB/s. In this paper, we propose PILC, an end-to-end image lossless compression framework that achieves 200 MB/s for both compression and decompression with a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, 10 times faster than the most efficient one before. To obtain this result, we first develop an AI codec that combines auto-regressive model and VQ-VAE which performs well in lightweight setting, then we design a low complexity entropy coder that works well with our codec. Experiments show that our framework compresses better than PNG by a margin of 30% in multiple datasets.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel compression and acceleration method based on data distribution characteristics for deep neural networks, namely Pruning Filter via Gaussian Distribution Feature (PFGDF). Compared with previous advanced pruning methods, PFGDF compresses the model by filters with insignificance in distribution, regardless of the contribution and sensitivity information of the convolution filter. PFGDF is significantly different from weight sparsification pruning because it does not require the special accelerated library to process the sparse weight matrix and introduces no more extra parameters. The pruning process of PFGDF is automated. Furthermore, the model compressed by PFGDF can restore the same performance as the uncompressed model. We evaluate PFGDF through extensive experiments, on CIFAR-10, PFGDF compresses the convolution filter on VGG-16 by 66.62% with more than 90% parameter reduced, while the inference time is accelerated by 83.73% on Huawei MATE 10.</p></details> |  | None |

Compared with other types of models, however, they are large, which results in a high hardware requirement to abridge time for both training and inference processes. In this work, cross-layer parameter sharing (CLPS), and knowledge distillation (KD) are used to reduce the sizes of transformers in molecular science. Both methods not only have competitive QSAR predictive performance as compared to the original BERT model, but also are more parameter efficient. Furthermore, by integrating CLPS and KD into a two-state chemical network, we introduce a new deep lite chemical transformer model, DeLiCaTe. DeLiCaTe captures general-domains as well as task-specific knowledge, which lead to a 4x faster rate of both training and inference due to a 10- and 3-times reduction of the number of parameters and layers, respectively. Meanwhile, it achieves comparable performance in QSAR and VS modeling. Moreover, we anticipate that the model compression strategy provides a pathway to the creation of effective generative transformer models for organic drug and material design.</p></details> |  | None |

As a model compression and acceleration method, knowledge distillation effectively improves the performance of small models by transferring the dark knowledge from the teacher detector. However, most of the existing distillation-based detection methods mainly imitating features near bounding boxes, which suffer from two limitations. First, they ignore the beneficial features outside the bounding boxes. Second, these methods imitate some features which are mistakenly regarded as the background by the teacher detector. To address the above issues, we propose a novel Feature-Richness Score (FRS) method to choose important features that improve generalized detectability during distilling. The proposed method effectively retrieves the important features outside the bounding boxes and removes the detrimental features within the bounding boxes. Extensive experiments show that our methods achieve excellent performance on both anchor-based and anchor-free detectors. For example, RetinaNet with ResNet-50 achieves 39.7% in mAP on the COCO2017 dataset, which even surpasses the ResNet-101 based teacher detector 38.9% by 0.8%.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is arguably the workhorse algorithm of ML. Distributed ML models trained by SGD involve large amounts of gradient communication, which limits the scalability of distributed ML. Thus, it is important to compress the gradients for reducing communication. In this paper, we propose FastSGD, a Fast compressed SGD framework for distributed ML. To achieve a high compression ratio at a low cost, FastSGD represents the gradients as key-value pairs, and compresses both the gradient keys and values in linear time complexity. For the gradient value compression, FastSGD first uses a reciprocal mapper to transform original values into reciprocal values, and then, it utilizes a logarithm quantization to further reduce reciprocal values to small integers. Finally, FastSGD filters reduced gradient integers by a given threshold. For the gradient key compression, FastSGD provides an adaptive fine-grained delta encoding method to store gradient keys with fewer bits. Extensive experiments on practical ML models and datasets demonstrate that FastSGD achieves the compression ratio up to 4 orders of magnitude, and accelerates the convergence time up to 8x, compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Compared with image classification, object detection is a more complex task, and designing specific KD methods for object detection is non-trivial. In this work, we elaborately study the behaviour difference between the teacher and student detection models, and obtain two intriguing observations: First, the teacher and student rank their detected candidate boxes quite differently, which results in their precision discrepancy. Second, there is a considerable gap between the feature response differences and prediction differences between teacher and student, indicating that equally imitating all the feature maps of the teacher is the sub-optimal choice for improving the student's accuracy. Based on the two observations, we propose Rank Mimicking (RM) and Prediction-guided Feature Imitation (PFI) for distilling one-stage detectors, respectively. RM takes the rank of candidate boxes from teachers as a new form of knowledge to distill, which consistently outperforms the traditional soft label distillation. PFI attempts to correlate feature differences with prediction differences, making feature imitation directly help to improve the student's accuracy. On MS COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks, extensive experiments are conducted on various detectors with different backbones to validate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, RetinaNet with ResNet50 achieves 40.4% mAP in MS COCO, which is 3.5% higher than its baseline, and also outperforms previous KD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2022</p></details> | None |

However, state-of-the-art accelerators such as GPUs are only equipped with very limited memory capacities due to hardware design constraints, which significantly limits the maximum batch size and hence performance speedup when training large-scale DNNs. Traditional memory saving techniques either suffer from performance overhead or are constrained by limited interconnect bandwidth or specific interconnect technology. In this paper, we propose a novel memory-efficient CNN training framework (called COMET) that leverages error-bounded lossy compression to significantly reduce the memory requirement for training, to allow training larger models or to accelerate training. Different from the state-of-the-art solutions that adopt image-based lossy compressors (such as JPEG) to compress the activation data, our framework purposely adopts error-bounded lossy compression with a strict error-controlling mechanism. Specifically, we perform a theoretical analysis on the compression error propagation from the altered activation data to the gradients, and empirically investigate the impact of altered gradients over the training process. Based on these analyses, we optimize the error-bounded lossy compression and propose an adaptive error-bound control scheme for activation data compression. We evaluate our design against state-of-the-art solutions with five widely-adopted CNNs and ImageNet dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework can significantly reduce the training memory consumption by up to 13.5X over the baseline training and 1.8X over another state-of-the-art compression-based framework, respectively, with little or no accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 17 figures, accepted by VLDB 2022. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2011.09017</p></details> | None |
| **[Accelerating JPEG Decompression on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09219v1)** | 2021-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The JPEG compression format has been the standard for lossy image compression for over multiple decades, offering high compression rates at minor perceptual loss in image quality. For GPU-accelerated computer vision and deep learning tasks, such as the training of image classification models, efficient JPEG decoding is essential due to limitations in memory bandwidth. As many decoder implementations are CPU-based, decoded image data has to be transferred to accelerators like GPUs via interconnects such as PCI-E, implying decreased throughput rates. JPEG decoding therefore represents a considerable bottleneck in these pipelines. In contrast, efficiency could be vastly increased by utilizing a GPU-accelerated decoder. In this case, only compressed data needs to be transferred, as decoding will be handled by the accelerators. In order to design such a GPU-based decoder, the respective algorithms must be parallelized on a fine-grained level. However, parallel decoding of individual JPEG files represents a complex task. In this paper, we present an efficient method for JPEG image decompression on GPUs, which implements an important subset of the JPEG standard. The proposed algorithm evaluates codeword locations at arbitrary positions in the bitstream, thereby enabling parallel decompression of independent chunks.

| **[Learning Interpretation with Explainable Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06945v1)** | 2021-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been considered as a key solution in model compression and acceleration in recent years. In KD, a small student model is generally trained from a large teacher model by minimizing the divergence between the probabilistic outputs of the two. However, as demonstrated in our experiments, existing KD methods might not transfer critical explainable knowledge of the teacher to the student, i.e. the explanations of predictions made by the two models are not consistent. In this paper, we propose a novel explainable knowledge distillation model, called XDistillation, through which both the performance the explanations' information are transferred from the teacher model to the student model. The XDistillation model leverages the idea of convolutional autoencoders to approximate the teacher explanations. Our experiments shows that models trained by XDistillation outperform those trained by conventional KD methods not only in term of predictive accuracy but also faithfulness to the teacher models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE BigData 2021</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, the same strategies have yielded ungratified performance on regression tasks because the nature between these and classification tasks differs. In this paper, a novel sign-exponent-only floating-point network (SEOFP-NET) technique is proposed to compress the model size and accelerate the inference time for speech enhancement, a regression task of speech signal processing. The proposed method compressed the sizes of deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement models by quantizing the fraction bits of single-precision floating-point parameters during training. Before inference implementation, all parameters in the trained SEOFP-NET model are slightly adjusted to accelerate the inference time by replacing the floating-point multiplier with an integer-adder. For generalization, the SEOFP-NET technique is introduced to different speech enhancement tasks in speech signal processing with different model architectures under various corpora. The experimental results indicate that the size of SEOFP-NET models can be significantly compressed by up to 81.249% without noticeably downgrading their speech enhancement performance, and the inference time can be accelerated to 1.212x compared with the baseline models. The results also verify that the proposed SEOFP-NET can cooperate with other efficiency strategies to achieve a synergy effect for model compression. In addition, the just noticeable difference (JND) was applied to the user study experiment to statistically analyze the effect of speech enhancement on listening. The results indicate that the listeners cannot facilely differentiate between the enhanced speech signals processed by the baseline model and the proposed SEOFP-NET.</p></details> |  | None |

Fortunately, recent advances in deep generative models have spearheaded a new class of so-called "neural compression" algorithms, which significantly outperform traditional codecs in terms of compression ratio. Unfortunately, the application of neural compression garners little commercial interest due to its limited bandwidth; therefore, developing highly efficient frameworks is of critical practical importance. In this paper, we discuss lossless compression using normalizing flows which have demonstrated a great capacity for achieving high compression ratios. As such, we introduce iFlow, a new method for achieving efficient lossless compression. We first propose Modular Scale Transform (MST) and a novel family of numerically invertible flow transformations based on MST. Then we introduce the Uniform Base Conversion System (UBCS), a fast uniform-distribution codec incorporated into iFlow, enabling efficient compression. iFlow achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and is $5\times$ quicker than other high-performance schemes. Furthermore, the techniques presented in this paper can be used to accelerate coding time for a broad class of flow-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for NeurIPS 2021 Spotlight</p></details> | None |
| **[Accelerating Framework of Transformer by Hardware Design and Model Compression Co-Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10030v1)** | 2021-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art Transformer-based models, with gigantic parameters, are difficult to be accommodated on resource constrained embedded devices. Moreover, with the development of technology, more and more embedded devices are available to run a Transformer model. For a Transformer model with different constraints (tight or loose), it can be deployed onto devices with different computing power. However, in previous work, designers did not choose the best device among multiple devices. Instead, they just used an existing device to deploy model, which was not necessarily the best fit and may lead to underutilization of resources. To address the deployment challenge of Transformer and the problem to select the best device, we propose an algorithm & hardware closed-loop acceleration framework. Given a dataset, a model, latency constraint LC and accuracy constraint AC, our framework can provide a best device satisfying both constraints. In order to generate a compressed model with high sparsity ratio, we propose a novel pruning technique, hierarchical pruning (HP). We optimize the sparse matrix storage format for HP matrix to further reduce memory usage for FPGA implementation. We design a accelerator that takes advantage of HP to solve the problem of concurrent random access. Experiments on Transformer and TinyBert model show that our framework can find different devices for various LC and AC, covering from low-end devices to high-end devices. Our HP can achieve higher sparsity ratio and is more flexible than other sparsity pattern. Our framework can achieve 37x, 1.9x, 1.7x speedup compared to CPU, GPU and FPGA, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Generative Adversarial Networks are powerful yet, resource-hungry deep-learning models. Their main difference from ordinary deep learning models is the nature of their output. For example, GAN output can be a whole image versus other models detecting objects or classifying images. Thus, the architecture and numeric precision of the network affect the quality and speed of the solution. Hence, accelerating GANs is pivotal. Accelerating GANs can be classified into three main tracks: (1) Memory compression, (2) Computation optimization, and (3) Data-flow optimization. Because data transfer is the main source of energy usage, memory compression leads to the most savings. Thus, in this paper, we survey memory compression techniques for CNN-Based GANs. Additionally, the paper summarizes opportunities and challenges in GANs acceleration and suggests open research problems to be further investigated.</p></details> | 21 pages, 17 figures | None |

For efficiently processing these computational- and memory-intensive applications, tensors of these over-parameterized models are compressed by leveraging sparsity, size reduction, and quantization of tensors. Unstructured sparsity and tensors with varying dimensions yield irregular computation, communication, and memory access patterns; processing them on hardware accelerators in a conventional manner does not inherently leverage acceleration opportunities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the efficient execution of sparse and irregular tensor computations of ML models on hardware accelerators. In particular, it discusses enhancement modules in the architecture design and the software support; categorizes different hardware designs and acceleration techniques and analyzes them in terms of hardware and execution costs; analyzes achievable accelerations for recent DNNs; highlights further opportunities in terms of hardware/software/model co-design optimizations (inter/intra-module). The takeaways from this paper include: understanding the key challenges in accelerating sparse, irregular-shaped, and quantized tensors; understanding enhancements in accelerator systems for supporting their efficient computations; analyzing trade-offs in opting for a specific design choice for encoding, storing, extracting, communicating, computing, and load-balancing the non-zeros; understanding how structured sparsity can improve storage efficiency and balance computations; understanding how to compile and map models with sparse tensors on the accelerators; understanding recent design trends for efficient accelerations and further opportunities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Proceedings of the IEEE</p></details> | None |

Slim Graph enables the developer to express numerous compression schemes using small and programmable compression kernels that can access and modify local parts of input graphs. Such kernels are executed in parallel by the underlying engine, isolating developers from complexities of parallel programming. Our kernels implement novel graph compression schemes that preserve numerous graph properties, for example connected components, minimum spanning trees, or graph spectra. Finally, Slim Graph uses statistical divergences and other metrics to analyze the accuracy of lossy graph compression. We illustrate both theoretically and empirically that Slim Graph accelerates numerous graph algorithms, reduces storage used by graph datasets, and ensures high accuracy of results. Slim Graph may become the common ground for developing, executing, and analyzing emerging lossy graph compression schemes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, limited by large model and computation complexity, GCNs for action recognition like 2s-AGCN have insufficient power-efficiency and throughput on GPU. Thus, the demand of model reduction and hardware acceleration for low-power GCNs action recognition application becomes continuously higher. To address challenges above, this paper proposes a runtime sparse feature compress accelerator with hybrid pruning method: RFC-HyPGCN. First, this method skips both graph and spatial convolution workloads by reorganizing the multiplication order. Following spatial convolution workloads channel-pruning dataflow, a coarse-grained pruning method on temporal filters is designed, together with sampling-like fine-grained pruning on time dimension. Later, we come up with an architecture where all convolutional layers are mapped on chip to pursue high throughput. To further reduce storage resource utilization, online sparse feature compress format is put forward. Features are divided and encoded into several banks according to presented format, then bank storage is split into depth-variable mini-banks. Furthermore, this work applies quantization, input-skipping and intra-PE dynamic data scheduling to accelerate the model. In experiments, proposed pruning method is conducted on 2s-AGCN, acquiring 3.0x-8.4x model compression ratio and 73.20\% graph-skipping efficiency with balancing weight pruning. Implemented on Xilinx XCKU-115 FPGA, the proposed architecture has the peak performance of 1142 GOP/s and achieves up to 9.19x and 3.91x speedup over high-end GPU NVIDIA 2080Ti and NVIDIA V100, respectively. Compared with latest accelerator for action recognition GCNs models, our design reaches 22.9x speedup and 28.93\% improvement on DSP efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2021 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)</p></details> | None |

We propose Weight Distillation to transfer the knowledge in the large network parameters through a parameter generator. Our experiments on WMT16 En-Ro, NIST12 Zh-En, and WMT14 En-De machine translation tasks show that weight distillation can train a small network that is 1.88~2.94x faster than the large network but with competitive performance.

Deep learning and, especially, the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provides impressive results in analyzing and understanding complex and dynamic scenes from visual data. The prediction horizons for those perception systems are very short and inference must often be performed in real time, stressing the need of transforming the original large pre-trained networks into new smaller models, by utilizing Model Compression and Acceleration (MCA) techniques. Our goal in this work is to investigate best practices for appropriately applying novel weight sharing techniques, optimizing the available variables and the training procedures towards the significant acceleration of widely adopted DNNs. Extensive evaluation studies carried out using various state-of-the-art DNN models in object detection and tracking experiments, provide details about the type of errors that manifest after the application of weight sharing techniques, resulting in significant acceleration gains with negligible accuracy losses.</p></details> |  | None |

However, to achieve these results, there is a high demand for computing and storing resources. This becomes problematic when, for instance, real-time, mobile applications are considered, in which the involved (embedded) devices have limited resources. A common way of addressing this problem is to transform the original large pre-trained networks into new smaller models, by utilizing Model Compression and Acceleration (MCA) techniques. Within the MCA framework, we propose a clustering-based approach that is able to increase the number of employed centroids/representatives, while at the same time, have an acceleration gain compared to conventional, $k$-means based approaches. This is achieved by imposing a special structure to the employed representatives, which is enabled by the particularities of the problem at hand. Moreover, the theoretical acceleration gains are presented and the key system hyper-parameters that affect that gain, are identified. Extensive evaluation studies carried out using various state-of-the-art DNN models trained in image classification, validate the superiority of the proposed method as compared for its use in MCA tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Most of the work in the literature utilize traditional segmentation methods that require a large amount of computational and storage resources. Deep learning has transformed computer vision and dramatically improved machine translation, though it requires massive dataset for training and significant resources for inference. More importantly, energy-efficient embedded vision hardware delivering real-time and robust performance is crucial in the aforementioned application. In this work, we propose a U-Net based tree delineation method, which is effectively trained using multi-spectral imagery but can then delineate single-spectrum images. The deep architecture that also performs localization, i.e., a class label corresponds to each pixel, has been successfully used to allow training with a small set of segmented images. The ground truth data were generated using traditional image denoising and segmentation approaches. To be able to execute the proposed DNN efficiently in embedded platforms designed for deep learning approaches, we employ traditional model compression and acceleration methods. Extensive evaluation studies using data collected from UAVs equipped with multi-spectral cameras demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in terms of delineation accuracy and execution efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Although capable of reducing a reasonable amount of model parameters, previous unstructured or structured weight pruning methods can hardly truly accelerate inference, either due to the poor hardware compatibility of the unstructured sparsity or due to the low sparse rate of the structurally pruned network. Aiming at reducing both storage and computation, as well as preserving the original task performance, we propose a generalized weight unification framework at a hardware compatible micro-structured level to achieve high amount of compression and acceleration. Weight coefficients of a selected micro-structured block are unified to reduce the storage and computation of the block without changing the neuron connections, which turns to a micro-structured pruning special case when all unified coefficients are set to zero, where neuron connections (hence storage and computation) are completely removed. In addition, we developed an effective training framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which converts our complex constrained optimization into separately solvable subproblems. Through iteratively optimizing the subproblems, the desired micro-structure can be ensured with high compression ratio and low performance degradation. We extensively evaluated our method using a variety of benchmark models and datasets for different applications. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures and 5 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Efficient Full 8-bit Integer DNN Online Training on Resource-limited Devices without Batch Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13890v1)** | 2021-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Huge computational costs brought by convolution and batch normalization (BN) have caused great challenges for the online training and corresponding applications of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially in resource-limited devices. Existing works only focus on the convolution or BN acceleration and no solution can alleviate both problems with satisfactory performance. Online training has gradually become a trend in resource-limited devices like mobile phones while there is still no complete technical scheme with acceptable model performance, processing speed, and computational cost. In this research, an efficient online-training quantization framework termed EOQ is proposed by combining Fixup initialization and a novel quantization scheme for DNN model compression and acceleration. Based on the proposed framework, we have successfully realized full 8-bit integer network training and removed BN in large-scale DNNs. Especially, weight updates are quantized to 8-bit integers for the first time. Theoretical analyses of EOQ utilizing Fixup initialization for removing BN have been further given using a novel Block Dynamical Isometry theory with weaker assumptions. Benefiting from rational quantization strategies and the absence of BN, the full 8-bit networks based on EOQ can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and immense advantages in computational cost and processing speed. What is more, the design of deep learning chips can be profoundly simplified for the absence of unfriendly square root operations in BN. Beyond this, EOQ has been evidenced to be more advantageous in small-batch online training with fewer batch samples. In summary, the EOQ framework is specially designed for reducing the high cost of convolution and BN in network training, demonstrating a broad application prospect of online training in resource-limited devices.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the large storage overheads and the substantial computation cost of CNNs are problematic in hardware accelerators. Computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture has demonstrated great potential to effectively compute large-scale matrix-vector multiplication. However, the intensive multiply and accumulation (MAC) operations executed at the crossbar array and the limited capacity of CIM macros remain bottlenecks for further improvement of energy efficiency and throughput. To reduce computation costs, network pruning and quantization are two widely studied compression methods to shrink the model size. However, most of the model compression algorithms can only be implemented in digital-based CNN accelerators. For implementation in a static random access memory (SRAM) CIM-based accelerator, the model compression algorithm must consider the hardware limitations of CIM macros, such as the number of word lines and bit lines that can be turned on at the same time, as well as how to map the weight to the SRAM CIM macro. In this study, a software and hardware co-design approach is proposed to design an SRAM CIM-based CNN accelerator and an SRAM CIM-aware model compression algorithm. To lessen the high-precision MAC required by batch normalization (BN), a quantization algorithm that can fuse BN into the weights is proposed. Furthermore, to reduce the number of network parameters, a sparsity algorithm that considers a CIM architecture is proposed. Last, MARS, a CIM-based CNN accelerator that can utilize multiple SRAM CIM macros as processing units and support a sparsity neural network, is proposed.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems 2021</p></details> | None |

Directly applying generic compression approaches yields poor results on GANs, which motivates a number of recent GAN compression works. While prior works mainly accelerate conditional GANs, e.g., pix2pix and CycleGAN, compressing state-of-the-art unconditional GANs has rarely been explored and is more challenging. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for unconditional GAN compression. We first introduce effective channel pruning and knowledge distillation schemes specialized for unconditional GANs. We then propose a novel content-aware method to guide the processes of both pruning and distillation. With content-awareness, we can effectively prune channels that are unimportant to the contents of interest, e.g., human faces, and focus our distillation on these regions, which significantly enhances the distillation quality. On StyleGAN2 and SN-GAN, we achieve a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art compression method. Notably, we reduce the FLOPs of StyleGAN2 by 11x with visually negligible image quality loss compared to the full-size model. More interestingly, when applied to various image manipulation tasks, our compressed model forms a smoother and better disentangled latent manifold, making it more effective for image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in CVPR2021</p></details> | None |

| **[Channel Compression: Rethinking Information Redundancy among Channels in CNN Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01696v1)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model compression and acceleration are attracting increasing attentions due to the demand for embedded devices and mobile applications. Research on efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) aims at removing feature redundancy by decomposing or optimizing the convolutional calculation. In this work, feature redundancy is assumed to exist among channels in CNN architectures, which provides some leeway to boost calculation efficiency. Aiming at channel compression, a novel convolutional construction named compact convolution is proposed to embrace the progress in spatial convolution, channel grouping and pooling operation. Specifically, the depth-wise separable convolution and the point-wise interchannel operation are utilized to efficiently extract features. Different from the existing channel compression method which usually introduces considerable learnable weights, the proposed compact convolution can reduce feature redundancy with no extra parameters. With the point-wise interchannel operation, compact convolutions implicitly squeeze the channel dimension of feature maps. To explore the rules on reducing channel redundancy in neural networks, the comparison is made among different point-wise interchannel operations. Moreover, compact convolutions are extended to tackle with multiple tasks, such as acoustic scene classification, sound event detection and image classification.

We study the impact of model size in this setting, focusing on Transformer models for NLP tasks that are limited by compute: self-supervised pretraining and high-resource machine translation. We first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per iteration, wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps. Moreover, this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore, the most compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely large models but stop after a small number of iterations. This leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models. However, we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques such as quantization and pruning than small models. Consequently, one can get the best of both worlds: heavily compressed, large models achieve higher accuracy than lightly compressed, small models.</p></details> | ICML 2020 | None |
| **[Accelerated Sparsified SGD with Error Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12224v2)** | 2020-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A stochastic gradient method for synchronous distributed optimization is studied. For reducing communication cost, we particularly focus on utilization of compression of communicated gradients. Several work has shown that {\it{sparsified}} stochastic gradient descent method (SGD) with {\it{error feedback}} asymptotically achieves the same rate as (non-sparsified) parallel SGD. However, from a viewpoint of non-asymptotic behavior, the compression error may cause slower convergence than non-sparsified SGD in early iterations. This is problematic in practical situations since early stopping is often adopted to maximize the generalization ability of learned models. For improving the previous results, we propose and theoretically analyse a sparsified stochastic gradient method with error feedback scheme combined with {\it{Nesterov's acceleration}}. It is shown that the necessary per iteration communication cost for maintaining the same rate as vanilla SGD can be smaller than non-accelerated methods in convex and even in nonconvex optimization problems. This indicates that our proposed method makes a better use of compressed information than previous methods. Numerical experiments are provided and empirically validates our theoretical findings.</p></details> | 25 pages, 16 figures | None |

However, existing deep neural network models are computationally expensive and memory intensive, hindering their deployment in devices with low memory resources or in applications with strict latency requirements. Therefore, a natural thought is to perform model compression and acceleration in deep networks without significantly decreasing the model performance. During the past five years, tremendous progress has been made in this area. In this paper, we review the recent techniques for compacting and accelerating DNN models. In general, these techniques are divided into four categories: parameter pruning and quantization, low-rank factorization, transferred/compact convolutional filters, and knowledge distillation. Methods of parameter pruning and quantization are described first, after that the other techniques are introduced. For each category, we also provide insightful analysis about the performance, related applications, advantages, and drawbacks. Then we go through some very recent successful methods, for example, dynamic capacity networks and stochastic depths networks. After that, we survey the evaluation matrices, the main datasets used for evaluating the model performance, and recent benchmark efforts. Finally, we conclude this paper, discuss remaining the challenges and possible directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, updated version including more recent works</p></details> | None |

We develop a novel algorithm to enforce a specially favorable DNN weight structure, where each layerwise weight matrix can be stored as the product of a small basis matrix and a large sparse coefficient matrix whose non-zero elements are all power-of-2. To our best knowledge, this algorithm is the first formulation that integrates three mainstream model compression ideas: sparsification or pruning, decomposition, and quantization, into one unified framework. The resulting sparse and readily-quantized DNN thus enjoys greatly reduced energy consumption in data movement as well as weight storage. On top of that, we further design a dedicated accelerator to fully utilize the SmartExchange-enforced weights to improve both energy efficiency and latency performance. Extensive experiments show that 1) on the algorithm level, SmartExchange outperforms state-of-the-art compression techniques, including merely sparsification or pruning, decomposition, and quantization, in various ablation studies based on nine DNN models and four datasets; and 2) on the hardware level, the proposed SmartExchange based accelerator can improve the energy efficiency by up to 6.7$\times$ and the speedup by up to 19.2$\times$ over four state-of-the-art DNN accelerators, when benchmarked on seven DNN models (including four standard DNNs, two compact DNN models, and one segmentation model) and three datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 47th International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA'2020)</p></details> | None |

In particular, operating directly on the motion vectors and residuals in the compressed video domain can significantly accelerate the compute, by not using the raw videos which demand colossal storage capacity. Existing methods approach this task as a multiple modalities problem. In this paper we are approaching the task in a completely different way; we are looking at the data from the compressed stream as a one unit clip and propose that the residual frames can replace the original RGB frames from the raw domain. Furthermore, we are using teacher-student method to aid the network in the compressed domain to mimic the teacher network in the raw domain. We show experiments on three leading datasets (HMDB51, UCF1, and Kinetics) that approach state-of-the-art accuracy on raw video data by using compressed data. Our model MFCD-Net outperforms prior methods in the compressed domain and more importantly, our model has 11X fewer parameters and 3X fewer Flops, dramatically improving the efficiency of video recognition inference. This approach enables applying neural networks exclusively in the compressed domain without compromising accuracy while accelerating performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2020: Joint Workshop on Efficient Deep Learning in Computer Vision</p></details> | None |

However, they are very computationally expensive and memory intensive which raises significant challenges when it comes to deploy or train them on strict latency applications or resource-limited environments. As a result, many attempts have been introduced to accelerate and compress deep learning models, however the majority were not able to maintain the same accuracy of the baseline models. In this paper, we describe EnSyth, a deep learning ensemble approach to enhance the predictability of compact neural network's models. First, we generate a set of diverse compressed deep learning models using different hyperparameters for a pruning method, after that we utilise ensemble learning to synthesise the outputs of the compressed models to compose a new pool of classifiers. Finally, we apply backward elimination on the generated pool to explore the best performing combinations of models. On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-5 data-sets with LeNet-5, EnSyth outperforms the predictability of the baseline model.</p></details> | accepted in SMC2019 | None |

So far, high compression rate algorithms require part of the training dataset for a low precision calibration, or a fine-tuning process. However, this requirement is unacceptable when the data is unavailable or contains sensitive information, as in medical and biometric use-cases. We present three methods for generating synthetic samples from trained models. Then, we demonstrate how these samples can be used to calibrate and fine-tune quantized models without using any real data in the process. Our best performing method has a negligible accuracy degradation compared to the original training set. This method, which leverages intrinsic batch normalization layers' statistics of the trained model, can be used to evaluate data similarity. Our approach opens a path towards genuine data-free model compression, alleviating the need for training data during model deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Experiments showed that the DP-Net allows larger compression than the state-of-the-art counterparts while preserving accuracy. The largest 77X compression ratio on Wide ResNet is achieved by combining DP-Net with other compression techniques. Furthermore, the DP-Net is extended for compressing a robust DNN model with negligible accuracy loss.

| **[Boosting Throughput and Efficiency of Hardware Spiking Neural Accelerators using Time Compression Supporting Multiple Spike Codes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04757v1)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are the third generation of neural networks and can explore both rate and temporal coding for energy-efficient event-driven computation. However, the decision accuracy of existing SNN designs is contingent upon processing a large number of spikes over a long period. Nevertheless, the switching power of SNN hardware accelerators is proportional to the number of spikes processed while the length of spike trains limits throughput and static power efficiency. This paper presents the first study on developing temporal compression to significantly boost throughput and reduce energy dissipation of digital hardware SNN accelerators while being applicable to multiple spike codes. The proposed compression architectures consist of low-cost input spike compression units, novel input-and-output-weighted spiking neurons, and reconfigurable time constant scaling to support large and flexible time compression ratios. Our compression architectures can be transparently applied to any given pre-designed SNNs employing either rate or temporal codes while incurring minimal modification of the neural models, learning algorithms, and hardware design. Using spiking speech and image recognition datasets, we demonstrate the feasibility of supporting large time compression ratios of up to 16x, delivering up to 15.93x, 13.88x, and 86.21x improvements in throughput, energy dissipation, the tradeoffs between hardware area, runtime, energy, and classification accuracy, respectively based on different spike codes on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA. These results are achieved while incurring little extra hardware overhead.</p></details> |  | None |

Modern DNN compression techniques comprise various hyperparameters that require per-layer customization to ensure high accuracy. Choosing such hyperparameters is cumbersome as the pertinent search space grows exponentially with the number of model layers. To effectively traverse this large space, we devise an intelligent sampling mechanism that adapts the sampling strategy using customized operations inspired by genetic algorithms. As a special case, we consider the space of model compression as a vector space. The adaptively selected samples enable ASCAI to automatically learn how to tune per-layer compression hyperparameters to optimize the accuracy/model-size trade-off. Our extensive evaluations show that ASCAI outperforms rule-based and reinforcement learning methods in terms of compression rate and/or accuracy</p></details> |  | None |

Network binarization is one of the existing effective techniques for model compression and acceleration, but there is no computing kernel yet to support it on PyTorch. In this paper we developed a computing kernel supporting 1-bit xnor and bitcount computation on PyTorch. Experimental results show that our kernel could accelerate the inference of the binarized neural network by 3 times in GPU and by 4.5 times in CPU compared with the control group.</p></details> |  | None |

One of the major obstacles hindering the ubiquitous use of CNNs for inference is their relatively high memory bandwidth requirements, which can be a main energy consumer and throughput bottleneck in hardware accelerators. Accordingly, an efficient feature map compression method can result in substantial performance gains. Inspired by quantization-aware training approaches, we propose a compression-aware training (CAT) method that involves training the model in a way that allows better compression of feature maps during inference. Our method trains the model to achieve low-entropy feature maps, which enables efficient compression at inference time using classical transform coding methods. CAT significantly improves the state-of-the-art results reported for quantization. For example, on ResNet-34 we achieve 73.1% accuracy (0.2% degradation from the baseline) with an average representation of only 1.79 bits per value.

To this end, we propose a novel loss that balances compression and acceleration of a deep learning model vs. loss of generalization capabilities. We apply our method to the existing tracker and detector models. We report detection results on the VIRAT and CAVIAR data sets. These results show our method to offer unprecedented compression rates along with improved detection. We apply our loss for tracker compression at test time, as it processes each video.

To solve this problem, we propose a threedimensional regularization-based neural network pruning method to assign different regularization parameters to different weight groups based on their importance to the network. Further we analyze the redundancy and computation cost for each layer to determine the different pruning ratios. Experiments show that pruning based on our method can lead to 2x theoretical speedup with only 0.41% accuracy loss for 3DResNet18 and 3.28% accuracy loss for C3D. The proposed method performs favorably against other popular methods for model compression and acceleration.</p></details> | ICIP 2019 | None |

However, existing methods are computationally intensive due to the computation cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) adopted by most work. To date, there is no effective network compression method for accelerating these models. In this paper, we propose a unified Transfer Channel Pruning (TCP) approach for accelerating UDA models. TCP is capable of compressing the deep UDA model by pruning less important channels while simultaneously learning transferable features by reducing the cross-domain distribution divergence. Therefore, it reduces the impact of negative transfer and maintains competitive performance on the target task. To the best of our knowledge, TCP is the first approach that aims at accelerating deep UDA models. TCP is validated on two benchmark datasets-Office-31 and ImageCLEF-DA with two common backbone networks-VGG16 and ResNet50. Experimental results demonstrate that TCP achieves comparable or better classification accuracy than other comparison methods while significantly reducing the computational cost. To be more specific, in VGG16, we get even higher accuracy after pruning 26% floating point operations (FLOPs); in ResNet50, we also get higher accuracy on half of the tasks after pruning 12% FLOPs. We hope that TCP will open a new door for future research on accelerating transfer learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2019; 8 pages</p></details> | None |

In parallel, we have also been observing an unprecedented demand in computational and memory requirements, rendering the efficient use of neural networks in low-powered devices virtually unattainable. Towards this end, we propose a three-stage compression and acceleration pipeline that sparsifies, quantizes and entropy encodes activation maps of Convolutional Neural Networks. Sparsification increases the representational power of activation maps leading to both acceleration of inference and higher model accuracy. Inception-V3 and MobileNet-V1 can be accelerated by as much as $1.6\times$ with an increase in accuracy of $0.38\%$ and $0.54\%$ on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets respectively. Quantizing and entropy coding the sparser activation maps lead to higher compression over the baseline, reducing the memory cost of the network execution. Inception-V3 and MobileNet-V1 activation maps, quantized to $16$ bits, are compressed by as much as $6\times$ with an increase in accuracy of $0.36\%$ and $0.55\%$ respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Pruning based on a small amount of training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08455v1)** | 2019-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training of models in pruning algorithms plays an important role in pruning decision-making. We find that excessive pre-training is not necessary for pruning algorithms. According to this idea, we propose a pruning algorithm---Incremental pruning based on less training (IPLT). Compared with the traditional pruning algorithm based on a large number of pre-training, IPLT has competitive compression effect than the traditional pruning algorithm under the same simple pruning strategy. On the premise of ensuring accuracy, IPLT can achieve 8x-9x compression for VGG-19 on CIFAR-10 and only needs to pre-train few epochs. For VGG-19 on CIFAR-10, we can not only achieve 10 times test acceleration, but also about 10 times training acceleration. At present, the research mainly focuses on the compression and acceleration in the application stage of the model, while the compression and acceleration in the training stage are few. We newly proposed a pruning algorithm that can compress and accelerate in the training stage. It is novel to consider the amount of pre-training required by pruning algorithm. Our results have implications: Too much pre-training may be not necessary for pruning algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional model compression techniques rely on hand-crafted heuristics and rule-based policies that require domain experts to explore the large design space trading off among model size, speed, and accuracy, which is usually sub-optimal and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose AutoML for Model Compression (AMC) which leverage reinforcement learning to provide the model compression policy. This learning-based compression policy outperforms conventional rule-based compression policy by having higher compression ratio, better preserving the accuracy and freeing human labor. Under 4x FLOPs reduction, we achieved 2.7% better accuracy than the handcrafted model compression policy for VGG-16 on ImageNet. We applied this automated, push-the-button compression pipeline to MobileNet and achieved 1.81x speedup of measured inference latency on an Android phone and 1.43x speedup on the Titan XP GPU, with only 0.1% loss of ImageNet Top-1 accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

However, much of this improvement is due to the growing use and availability of computational resources (e.g use of GPUs, more layers, more parameters, etc). Most state-of-the-art deep networks, despite performing well, over-parameterize approximate functions and take a significant amount of time to train. With increased focus on deploying deep neural networks on resource constrained devices like smart phones, there has been a push to evaluate why these models are so resource hungry and how they can be made more efficient. This work evaluates and compares three distinct methods for deep model compression and acceleration: weight pruning, low rank factorization, and knowledge distillation. Comparisons on VGG nets trained on CIFAR10 show that each of the models on their own are effective, but that the true power lies in combining them. We show that by combining pruning and knowledge distillation methods we can create a compressed network 85 times smaller than the original, all while retaining 96% of the original model's accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2018 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)</p></details> | None |

However, due to their size and the computational complexity, large DNNs are not readily deployable on edge devices in real-time. To manage complexity and accelerate computation, network compression techniques based on pruning and quantization have been proposed and shown to be effective in reducing network size. However, such network compression can result in irregular matrix structures that are mismatched with modern hardware-accelerated platforms, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) designed to perform the DNN matrix multiplications in a structured (block-based) way. We propose MPDCompress, a DNN compression algorithm based on matrix permutation decomposition via random mask generation. In-training application of the masks molds the synaptic weight connection matrix to a sub-graph separation format. Aided by the random permutations, a hardware-desirable block matrix is generated, allowing for a more efficient implementation and compression of the network. To show versatility, we empirically verify MPDCompress on several network models, compression rates, and image datasets. On the LeNet 300-100 model (MNIST dataset), Deep MNIST, and CIFAR10, we achieve 10 X network compression with less than 1% accuracy loss compared to non-compressed accuracy performance. On AlexNet for the full ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset, we achieve 8 X network compression with less than 1% accuracy loss, with top-5 and top-1 accuracies of 79.6% and 56.4%, respectively. Finally, we observe that the algorithm can offer inference speedups across various hardware platforms, with 4 X faster operation achieved on several mobile GPUs.</p></details> |  | None |

These latest progresses greatly facilitate the developments in various areas such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, along with the extraordinary performance, these state-of-the-art models also bring in expensive computational cost. Directly deploying these models into applications with real-time requirement is still infeasible. Recently, Hinton etal. have shown that the dark knowledge within a powerful teacher model can significantly help the training of a smaller and faster student network. These knowledge are vastly beneficial to improve the generalization ability of the student model. Inspired by their work, we introduce a new type of knowledge -- cross sample similarities for model compression and acceleration. This knowledge can be naturally derived from deep metric learning model. To transfer them, we bring the "learning to rank" technique into deep metric learning formulation. We test our proposed DarkRank method on various metric learning tasks including pedestrian re-identification, image retrieval and image clustering. The results are quite encouraging. Our method can improve over the baseline method by a large margin. Moreover, it is fully compatible with other existing methods. When combined, the performance can be further boosted.</p></details> |  | None |

Inference process of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) has a large number of parameters, requires a large amount of computation, and can be very slow. The large number of parameters also require large amounts of memory. This is resulting in increasingly long computation times and large model sizes. To implement mobile and other low performance devices incorporating DCNN, model sizes must be compressed and computation must be accelerated. To that end, this paper proposes Binary-decomposed DCNN, which resolves these issues without the need for retraining. Our method replaces real-valued inner-product computations with binary inner-product computations in existing network models to accelerate computation of inference and decrease model size without the need for retraining. Binary computations can be done at high speed using logical operators such as XOR and AND, together with bit counting. In tests using AlexNet with the ImageNet classification task, speed increased by a factor of 1.79, models were compressed by approximately 80%, and increase in error rate was limited to 1.20%. With VGG-16, speed increased by a factor of 2.07, model sizes decreased by 81%, and error increased by only 2.16%.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

The importance of each filter is evaluated by the proposed entropy-based method first. Then several unimportant filters are discarded to get a smaller CNN model. Finally, fine-tuning is adopted to recover its generalization ability which is damaged during filter pruning. Our method can reduce the size of intermediate activations, which would dominate most memory footprint during model training stage but is less concerned in previous compression methods. Experiments on the ILSVRC-12 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with previous filter importance evaluation criteria, our entropy-based method obtains better performance. We achieve 3.3x speed-up and 16.64x compression on VGG-16, 1.54x acceleration and 1.47x compression on ResNet-50, both with about 1% top-5 accuracy decrease.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Compressed Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Background Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04205v2)** | 2016-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the method of compressed dynamic mode decomposition (cDMD) for background modeling. The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a regression technique that integrates two of the leading data analysis methods in use today: Fourier transforms and singular value decomposition. Borrowing ideas from compressed sensing and matrix sketching, cDMD eases the computational workload of high resolution video processing. The key principal of cDMD is to obtain the decomposition on a (small) compressed matrix representation of the video feed. Hence, the cDMD algorithm scales with the intrinsic rank of the matrix, rather then the size of the actual video (data) matrix. Selection of the optimal modes characterizing the background is formulated as a sparsity-constrained sparse coding problem. Our results show, that the quality of the resulting background model is competitive, quantified by the F-measure, Recall and Precision. A GPU (graphics processing unit) accelerated implementation is also presented which further boosts the computational efficiency of the algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Journal of Real-Time Image Processing</p></details> | None |
| **[Video Compressive Sensing for Dynamic MRI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7715v2)** | 2014-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a video compressive sensing framework, termed kt-CSLDS, to accelerate the image acquisition process of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We are inspired by a state-of-the-art model for video compressive sensing that utilizes a linear dynamical system (LDS) to model the motion manifold. Given compressive measurements, the state sequence of an LDS can be first estimated using system identification techniques. We then reconstruct the observation matrix using a joint structured sparsity assumption. In particular, we minimize an objective function with a mixture of wavelet sparsity and joint sparsity within the observation matrix. We derive an efficient convex optimization algorithm through alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and provide a theoretical guarantee for global convergence. We demonstrate the performance of our approach for video compressive sensing, in terms of reconstruction accuracy. We also investigate the impact of various sampling strategies. We apply this framework to accelerate the acquisition process of dynamic MRI and show it achieves the best reconstruction accuracy with the least computational time compared with existing algorithms in the literature.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures | None |
