| **[CosmoBench: A Multiscale, Multiview, Multitask Cosmology Benchmark for Geometric Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03707v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training time. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at https://cosmobench.streamlit.app</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Localisation of Regularised and Multiview Support Vector Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05655v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove a few representer theorems for a localised version of the regularised and multiview support vector machine learning problem introduced by H.Q. Minh, L. Bazzani, and V. Murino, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17(2016) 1-72, that involves operator valued positive semidefinite kernels and their reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The results concern general cases when convex or nonconvex loss functions and finite or infinite dimensional input spaces are considered. We show that the general framework allows infinite dimensional input spaces and nonconvex loss functions for some special cases, in particular in case the loss functions are Gateaux differentiable. Detailed calculations are provided for the exponential least squares loss functions that lead to systems of partially nonlinear equations for which a particular different types of Newton's approximation methods based on the interior point method can be used. Some numerical experiments are performed on a toy model that illustrate the tractability of the methods that we propose.</p></details> | 39 pages | None |
| **[AMAuT: A Flexible and Efficient Multiview Audio Transformer Framework Trained from Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19368v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent foundational models, SSAST, EAT, HuBERT, Qwen-Audio, and Audio Flamingo, achieve top-tier results across standard audio benchmarks but are limited by fixed input rates and durations, hindering their reusability. This paper introduces the Augmentation-driven Multiview Audio Transformer (AMAuT), a training-from-scratch framework that eliminates the dependency on pre-trained weights while supporting arbitrary sample rates and audio lengths. AMAuT integrates four key components: (1) augmentation-driven multiview learning for robustness, (2) a conv1 + conv7 + conv1 one-dimensional CNN bottleneck for stable temporal encoding, (3) dual CLS + TAL tokens for bidirectional context representation, and (4) test-time adaptation/augmentation (TTA^2) to improve inference reliability. Experiments on five public benchmarks, AudioMNIST, SpeechCommands V1 & V2, VocalSound, and CochlScene, show that AMAuT achieves accuracies up to 99.8% while consuming less than 3% of the GPU hours required by comparable pre-trained models. Thus, AMAuT presents a highly efficient and flexible alternative to large pre-trained models, making state-of-the-art audio classification accessible in computationally constrained settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FLEX: A Largescale Multimodal, Multiview Dataset for Learning Structured Representations for Fitness Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03198v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action Quality Assessment (AQA) -- the task of quantifying how well an action is performed -- has great potential for detecting errors in gym weight training, where accurate feedback is critical to prevent injuries and maximize gains. Existing AQA datasets, however, are limited to single-view competitive sports and RGB video, lacking multimodal signals and professional assessment of fitness actions. We introduce FLEX, the first large-scale, multimodal, multiview dataset for fitness AQA that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG). FLEX contains over 7,500 multiview recordings of 20 weight-loaded exercises performed by 38 subjects of diverse skill levels, with synchronized RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological signals. Expert annotations are organized into a Fitness Knowledge Graph (FKG) linking actions, key steps, error types, and feedback, supporting a compositional scoring function for interpretable quality assessment. FLEX enables multimodal fusion, cross-modal prediction -- including the novel Video$\rightarrow$EMG task -- and biomechanically oriented representation learning. Building on the FKG, we further introduce FLEX-VideoQA, a structured question-answering benchmark with hierarchical queries that drive cross-modal reasoning in vision-language models. Baseline experiments demonstrate that multimodal inputs, multiview video, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance AQA performance. FLEX thus advances AQA toward richer multimodal settings and provides a foundation for AI-powered fitness assessment and coaching.

| **[Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11171v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them. However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture. Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has 14 pages and 7 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Alignment Unlocks Complementarity: A Framework for Multiview Circuit Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20968v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich, complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Fused State Representations for Control from Multi-View Observations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01316v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Reinforcement Learning (MVRL) seeks to provide agents with multi-view observations, enabling them to perceive environment with greater effectiveness and precision. Recent advancements in MVRL focus on extracting latent representations from multiview observations and leveraging them in control tasks. However, it is not straightforward to learn compact and task-relevant representations, particularly in the presence of redundancy, distracting information, or missing views. In this paper, we propose Multi-view Fusion State for Control (MFSC), firstly incorporating bisimulation metric learning into MVRL to learn task-relevant representations. Furthermore, we propose a multiview-based mask and latent reconstruction auxiliary task that exploits shared information across views and improves MFSC's robustness in missing views by introducing a mask token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in MVRL tasks. Even in more realistic scenarios with interference or missing views, MFSC consistently maintains high performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tenma: Robust Cross-Embodiment Robot Manipulation with Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11865v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling Transformer policies and diffusion models has advanced robotic manipulation, yet combining these techniques in lightweight, cross-embodiment learning settings remains challenging. We study design choices that most affect stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning policies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Multi-population Ensemble Genetic Programming via Cooperative Coevolution and Multi-view Learning for Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19339v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Multi-population Ensemble Genetic Programming (MEGP), a computational intelligence framework that integrates cooperative coevolution and the multiview learning paradigm to address classification challenges in high-dimensional and heterogeneous feature spaces. MEGP decomposes the input space into conditionally independent feature subsets, enabling multiple subpopulations to evolve in parallel while interacting through a dynamic ensemble-based fitness mechanism. Each individual encodes multiple genes whose outputs are aggregated via a differentiable softmax-based weighting layer, enhancing both model interpretability and adaptive decision fusion. A hybrid selection mechanism incorporating both isolated and ensemble-level fitness promotes inter-population cooperation while preserving intra-population diversity. This dual-level evolutionary dynamic facilitates structured search exploration and reduces premature convergence. Experimental evaluations across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGP consistently outperforms a baseline GP model in terms of convergence behavior and generalization performance. Comprehensive statistical analyses validate significant improvements in Log-Loss, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC. MEGP also exhibits robust diversity retention and accelerated fitness gains throughout evolution, highlighting its effectiveness for scalable, ensemble-driven evolutionary learning. By unifying population-based optimization, multi-view representation learning, and cooperative coevolution, MEGP contributes a structurally adaptive and interpretable framework that advances emerging directions in evolutionary machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>59 Pa...</summary><p>59 Pages, 68 Figures, 27 Tables</p></details> | None |
| **[LMVC: An End-to-End Learned Multiview Video Coding Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03922v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive 3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding (LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research in this field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Joint Sparse Self-Representation Learning Method for Multiview Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06857v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view, cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability. To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Incomplete Multiview Learning via Wyner Common Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09843v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incomplete multiview clustering is of high recent interest, fueled by the advancement of common information-based deep multiview learning. The practical scenarios where unpaired multiview data with missing values have wide applications in generative learning, cross-modal retrieval, and wireless device identification problems. Following the perspective that the shared information between the incomplete multiview data aligns with the cluster targets, recent works have generalized the well-known common information frameworks in information theory multiview learning problems, with improved performance reported. Different from previous works, we extend the frameworks to incomplete multiview clustering problems and propose an efficient solver: Wyner Incomplete MultiView Clustering (WyIMVC). Interestingly, the common randomness in WyIMVC allows for joint clustering and missing value inference in contrast to the compared methods in the literature. Moreover, leveraging the difference-of-convex structure of the formulated problems, we propose an efficient solver with a convergence guarantee independent of initialization. Empirically, our solver outperforms the state-of-the-art solvers in a range of incomplete multiview datasets with varying numbers of views and dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, ITW2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DeepCell: Self-Supervised Multiview Fusion for Circuit Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06816v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DeepCell, a novel circuit representation learning framework that effectively integrates multiview information from both And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) and Post-Mapping (PM) netlists. At its core, DeepCell employs a self-supervised Mask Circuit Modeling (MCM) strategy, inspired by masked language modeling, to fuse complementary circuit representations from different design stages into unified and rich embeddings. To our knowledge, DeepCell is the first framework explicitly designed for PM netlist representation learning, setting new benchmarks in both predictive accuracy and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate the practical efficacy of DeepCell by applying it to critical EDA tasks such as functional Engineering Change Orders (ECO) and technology mapping. Extensive experimental results show that DeepCell significantly surpasses state-of-the-art open-source EDA tools in efficiency and performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Facial Emotion Learning with Text-Guided Multiview Fusion via Vision-Language Model for 3D/4D Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01673v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion, Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions, and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks, including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset, demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework. Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rig3R: Rig-Aware Conditioning for Learned 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02265v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating agent pose and 3D scene structure from multi-camera rigs is a central task in embodied AI applications such as autonomous driving. Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure. To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing. Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Multi-View Representation Learning using Vision-Language Model for 3D/4D Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01203v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression recognition (FER) is a fundamental task in affective computing with applications in human-computer interaction, mental health analysis, and behavioral understanding. In this paper, we propose SMILE-VLM, a self-supervised vision-language model for 3D/4D FER that unifies multiview visual representation learning with natural language supervision. SMILE-VLM learns robust, semantically aligned, and view-invariant embeddings by proposing three core components: multiview decorrelation via a Barlow Twins-style loss, vision-language contrastive alignment, and cross-modal redundancy minimization. Our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. We further extend SMILE-VLM to the task of 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) to recognize the subtle affective cues. The extensive results demonstrate that SMILE-VLM not only surpasses existing unsupervised methods but also matches or exceeds supervised baselines, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution for expressive facial behavior understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Advancing from Automated to Autonomous Beamline by Leveraging Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00836v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The synchrotron light source, a cutting-edge large-scale user facility, requires autonomous synchrotron beamline operations, a crucial technique that should enable experiments to be conducted automatically, reliably, and safely with minimum human intervention. However, current state-of-the-art synchrotron beamlines still heavily rely on human safety oversight. To bridge the gap between automated and autonomous operation, a computer vision-based system is proposed, integrating deep learning and multiview cameras for real-time collision detection. The system utilizes equipment segmentation, tracking, and geometric analysis to assess potential collisions with transfer learning that enhances robustness. In addition, an interactive annotation module has been developed to improve the adaptability to new object classes. Experiments on a real beamline dataset demonstrate high accuracy, real-time performance, and strong potential for autonomous synchrotron beamline operations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Refining Few-Step Text-to-Multiview Diffusion via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20107v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-multiview (T2MV) generation, which produces coherent multiview images from a single text prompt, remains computationally intensive, while accelerated T2MV methods using few-step diffusion models often sacrifice image fidelity and view consistency. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its few-step efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous monocular dynamic NeRF or Gaussian Splatting methods strongly rely on the rapid move ment of input cameras to construct multiview consistency but struggle to recon struct dynamic scenes on casually captured input videos whose cameras are either static or move slowly. To address this challenging task, MoDGS adopts recent single-view depth estimation methods to guide the learning of the dynamic scene. Then, a novel 3D-aware initialization method is proposed to learn a reasonable deformation field and a new robust depth loss is proposed to guide the learning of dynamic scene geometry. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MoDGS is able to render high-quality novel view images of dynamic scenes from just a casually captured monocular video, which outperforms state-of-the-art meth ods by a significant margin.

Our architecture integrates pseudo-labels derived from generated textual prompts to guide implicit alignment of emotional semantics. To capture shared information across multi-views, we propose a joint embedding space that aligns multiview representations without requiring explicit supervision. We further enhance the discriminability of our model through a novel multiview contrastive learning strategy that leverages stable positive-negative pair sampling. A gradient-friendly loss function is introduced to promote smoother and more stable convergence, and the model is optimized for distributed training to ensure scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiviewVLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and can be easily adapted to various real-world applications with minimal modifications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Matching Distance and Geometric Distribution Aided Learning Multiview Point Cloud Registration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03692v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview point cloud registration plays a crucial role in robotics, automation, and computer vision fields. This paper concentrates on pose graph construction and motion synchronization within multiview registration. Previous methods for pose graph construction often pruned fully connected graphs or constructed sparse graph using global feature aggregated from local descriptors, which may not consistently yield reliable results. To identify dependable pairs for pose graph construction, we design a network model that extracts information from the matching distance between point cloud pairs. For motion synchronization, we propose another neural network model to calculate the absolute pose in a data-driven manner, rather than optimizing inaccurate handcrafted loss functions. Our model takes into account geometric distribution information and employs a modified attention mechanism to facilitate flexible and reliable feature interaction. Experimental results on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Additionally, we introduce augmented textual prompts to enhance the model's linguistic capabilities and employ mixed view augmentation to expand the visual dataset. We also develop a Streamlit app for a real-time interactive inference and enable the model for distributed learning.

| **[A Data-Centric Revisit of Pre-Trained Vision Models for Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06960v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision models (PVMs) are fundamental to modern robotics, yet their optimal configuration remains unclear. Through systematic evaluation, we find that while DINO and iBOT outperform MAE across visuomotor control and perception tasks, they struggle when trained on non-(single-)object-centric (NOC) data--a limitation strongly correlated with their diminished ability to learn object-centric representations. This investigation indicates that the ability to form object-centric representations from the non-object-centric robotics dataset is the key to success for PVMs. Motivated by this discovery, we designed SlotMIM, a method that induces object-centric representations by introducing a semantic bottleneck to reduce the number of prototypes to encourage the emergence of objectness as well as cross-view consistency regularization for encouraging multiview invariance. Our experiments encompass pre-training on object-centric, scene-centric, web-crawled, and ego-centric data. Across all settings, our approach learns transferrable representations and achieves significant improvements over prior work in image recognition, scene understanding, and robot learning evaluations. When scaled up with million-scale datasets, our method also demonstrates superior data efficiency and scalability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SlotMIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SlotMIM) |

In this paper, we propose GAGS, a framework that distills 2D CLIP features into 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling open-vocabulary queries for renderings on arbitrary viewpoints. The main challenge of distilling 2D features for 3D fields lies in the multiview inconsistency of extracted 2D features, which provides unstable supervision for the 3D feature field. GAGS addresses this challenge with two novel strategies. First, GAGS associates the prompt point density of SAM with the camera distances, which significantly improves the multiview consistency of segmentation results. Second, GAGS further decodes a granularity factor to guide the distillation process and this granularity factor can be learned in a unsupervised manner to only select the multiview consistent 2D features in the distillation process.

| **[Segment Any Mesh](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13679v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Segment Any Mesh, a novel zero-shot mesh part segmentation method that overcomes the limitations of shape analysis-based, learning-based, and contemporary approaches. Our approach operates in two phases: multimodal rendering and 2D-to-3D lifting. In the first phase, multiview renders of the mesh are individually processed through Segment Anything to generate 2D masks. These masks are then lifted into a mesh part segmentation by associating masks that refer to the same mesh part across the multiview renders. We find that applying Segment Anything to multimodal feature renders of normals and shape diameter scalars achieves better results than using only untextured renders of meshes. By building our method on top of Segment Anything, we seamlessly inherit any future improvements made to 2D segmentation. We compare our method with a robust, well-evaluated shape analysis method, Shape Diameter Function, and show that our method is comparable to or exceeds its performance. Since current benchmarks contain limited object diversity, we also curate and release a dataset of generated meshes and use it to demonstrate our method's improved generalization over Shape Diameter Function via human evaluation. We release the code and dataset at https://github.com/gtangg12/samesh</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/gtangg12/samesh) |

Most IMVC approaches tackle this problem by either learning consensus representations from available views or reconstructing missing samples using the underlying manifold structure. However, the reconstruction of learned similarity graph tensor in prior studies only exploits the low-tubal-rank information, neglecting the exploration of inter-view correlations. This paper propose a novel joint tensor and inter-view low-rank Recovery (JTIV-LRR), framing IMVC as a joint optimization problem that integrates incomplete similarity graph learning and tensor representation recovery. By leveraging both intra-view and inter-view low rank information, the method achieves robust estimation of the complete similarity graph tensor through sparse noise removal and low-tubal-rank constraints along different modes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, achieving significant improvements in clustering accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under review at IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</p></details> | None |

However, a significant challenge persists in single-criteria recommender systems, which often overlook the diverse attributes of items that have been addressed by Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems (MCRS). Shared embedding vector for multi-criteria item ratings but have struggled to capture the nuanced relationships between users and items based on specific criteria. In this study, we present a novel representation for Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems (MCRS) based on a multi-edge bipartite graph, where each edge represents one criterion rating of items by users, and Multiview Dual Graph Attention Networks (MDGAT). Employing MDGAT is beneficial and important for adequately considering all relations between users and items, given the presence of both local (criterion-based) and global (multi-criteria) relations. Additionally, we define anchor points in each view based on similarity and employ local and global contrastive learning to distinguish between positive and negative samples across each view and the entire graph. We evaluate our method on two real-world datasets and assess its performance based on item rating predictions. The results demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy compared to the baseline method for predicting item ratings on the same datasets. MDGAT effectively capture the local and global impact of neighbours and the similarity between nodes.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods focus on pairwise registration of two point clouds with high overlap. Although there have been some methods for low overlap cases, they struggle in degraded scenarios. This paper introduces a novel framework dubbed L-PR, designed to register unordered low overlap multiview point clouds leveraging LiDAR fiducial markers. We refer to them as LiDAR fiducial markers, but they are the same as the popular AprilTag and ArUco markers, thin sheets of paper that do not affect the 3D geometry of the environment. We first propose an improved adaptive threshold marker detection method to provide robust detection results when the viewpoints among point clouds change dramatically. Then, we formulate the unordered multiview point cloud registration problem as a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem and develop a framework consisting of two levels of graphs to address it. The first-level graph, constructed as a weighted graph, is designed to efficiently and optimally infer initial values of scan poses from the unordered set. The second-level graph is constructed as a factor graph. By globally optimizing the variables on the graph, including scan poses, marker poses, and marker corner positions, we tackle the MAP problem. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and to showcase that L-PR can serve as a low-cost and efficient tool for 3D asset collection and training data collection. In particular, we collect a new dataset named Livox-3DMatch using L-PR and incorporate it into the training of the SOTA learning-based method, SGHR, which brings evident improvements for SGHR on various benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to its shallow learning nature, RVFL often fails to consider all the relevant information available in a dataset. Additionally, it overlooks the geometrical properties of the dataset. To address these limitations, a novel graph random vector functional link based on multi-view learning (GRVFL-MV) model is proposed. The proposed model is trained on multiple views, incorporating the concept of multiview learning (MVL), and it also incorporates the geometrical properties of all the views using the graph embedding (GE) framework. The fusion of RVFL networks, MVL, and GE framework enables our proposed model to achieve the following: i) efficient learning: by leveraging the topology of RVFL, our proposed model can efficiently capture nonlinear relationships within the multi-view data, facilitating efficient and accurate predictions; ii) comprehensive representation: fusing information from diverse perspectives enhance the proposed model's ability to capture complex patterns and relationships within the data, thereby improving the model's overall generalization performance; and iii) structural awareness: by employing the GE framework, our proposed model leverages the original data distribution of the dataset by naturally exploiting both intrinsic and penalty subspace learning criteria. The evaluation of the proposed GRVFL-MV model on various datasets, including 27 UCI and KEEL datasets, 50 datasets from Corel5k, and 45 datasets from AwA, demonstrates its superior performance compared to baseline models. These results highlight the enhanced generalization capabilities of the proposed GRVFL-MV model across a diverse range of datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Consensus Network for Multiview Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01961v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview feature learning aims to learn discriminative features by integrating the distinct information in each view. However, most existing methods still face significant challenges in learning view-consistency features, which are crucial for effective multiview learning. Motivated by the theories of CCA and contrastive learning in multiview feature learning, we propose the hierarchical consensus network (HCN) in this paper. The HCN derives three consensus indices for capturing the hierarchical consensus across views, which are classifying consensus, coding consensus, and global consensus, respectively. Specifically, classifying consensus reinforces class-level correspondence between views from a CCA perspective, while coding consensus closely resembles contrastive learning and reflects contrastive comparison of individual instances. Global consensus aims to extract consensus information from two perspectives simultaneously. By enforcing the hierarchical consensus, the information within each view is better integrated to obtain more comprehensive and discriminative features. The extensive experimental results obtained on four multiview datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 accepted paper</p></details> | None |

While multi-view learning has undergone vigorous development and achieved remarkable success, the theoretical understanding of its generalization behavior remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this gap by developing information-theoretic generalization bounds for multi-view learning, with a particular focus on multi-view reconstruction and classification tasks. Our bounds underscore the importance of capturing both consensus and complementary information from multiple different views to achieve maximally disentangled representations. These results also indicate that applying the multi-view information bottleneck regularizer is beneficial for satisfactory generalization performance. Additionally, we derive novel data-dependent bounds under both leave-one-out and supersample settings, yielding computational tractable and tighter bounds. In the interpolating regime, we further establish the fast-rate bound for multi-view learning, exhibiting a faster convergence rate compared to conventional square-root bounds. Numerical results indicate a strong correlation between the true generalization gap and the derived bounds across various learning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bayesian Joint Additive Factor Models for Multiview Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00778v3)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is increasingly common in a wide variety of applied settings to collect data of multiple different types on the same set of samples. Our particular focus in this article is on studying relationships between such multiview features and responses. A motivating application arises in the context of precision medicine where multi-omics data are collected to correlate with clinical outcomes. It is of interest to infer dependence within and across views while combining multimodal information to improve the prediction of outcomes. The signal-to-noise ratio can vary substantially across views, motivating more nuanced statistical tools beyond standard late and early fusion. This challenge comes with the need to preserve interpretability, select features, and obtain accurate uncertainty quantification. We propose a joint additive factor regression model (JAFAR) with a structured additive design, accounting for shared and view-specific components. We ensure identifiability via a novel dependent cumulative shrinkage process (D-CUSP) prior. We provide an efficient implementation via a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and extend our approach to allow flexible feature and outcome distributions. Prediction of time-to-labor onset from immunome, metabolome, and proteome data illustrates performance gains against state-of-the-art competitors.

This study introduces a novel SSL approach, Information-Maximized Soft Variable Discretization (IMSVD), for image representation learning. Specifically, IMSVD softly discretizes each variable in the latent space, enabling the estimation of their probability distributions over training batches and allowing the learning process to be directly guided by information measures. Motivated by the MultiView assumption, we propose an information-theoretic objective function to learn transform-invariant, non-travail, and redundancy-minimized representation features. We then derive a joint-cross entropy loss function for self-supervised image representation learning, which theoretically enjoys superiority over the existing methods in reducing feature redundancy. Notably, our non-contrastive IMSVD method statistically performs contrastive learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IMSVD on various downstream tasks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Thanks to our variable discretization, the embedding features optimized by IMSVD offer unique explainability at the variable level. IMSVD has the potential to be adapted to other learning paradigms.

The audio-visual weak-correlation in such setting poses new challenges in deriving innovative methods to answer if or how we can use cross-modal information to solve the task. Towards this end, we propose to use an acoustic-camera rig consisting of a pinhole RGB-D camera and a coplanar four-channel microphone array~(Mic-Array). By using this rig to record audio-visual signals from multiviews, we can use the cross-modal cues to estimate the sound sources 3D locations. Specifically, our framework SoundLoc3D treats the task as a set prediction problem, each element in the set corresponds to a potential sound source. Given the audio-visual weak-correlation, the set representation is initially learned from a single view microphone array signal, and then refined by actively incorporating physical surface cues revealed from multiview RGB-D images. We demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of SoundLoc3D on large-scale simulated dataset, and further show its robustness to RGB-D measurement inaccuracy and ambient noise interference.</p></details> | Accepted by WACV2025 | None |

However, current vehicle dispatch systems struggle to navigate the complexities of urban traffic dynamics, including unpredictable traffic conditions, diverse driver behaviors, and fluctuating supply and demand patterns. These challenges have resulted in travel difficulties for passengers in certain areas, while many drivers in other areas are unable to secure orders, leading to a decline in the overall quality of urban transportation services. To address these issues, this paper introduces GARLIC: a framework of GPT-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Intelligent Control for vehicle dispatching. GARLIC utilizes multiview graphs to capture hierarchical traffic states, and learns a dynamic reward function that accounts for individual driving behaviors. The framework further integrates a GPT model trained with a custom loss function to enable high-precision predictions and optimize dispatching policies in real-world scenarios. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that GARLIC effectively aligns with driver behaviors while reducing the empty load rate of vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Recent Gaussian-based 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved impressive results in recovering high-fidelity 3D assets from sparse input images by predicting 3D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. However, these techniques often lack the extensive priors and expressiveness offered by Diffusion Models. On the other hand, 2D Diffusion Models, which have been successfully applied to denoise multiview images, show potential for generating a wide range of photorealistic 3D outputs but still fall short on explicit 3D priors and consistency. In this work, we aim to bridge these two approaches by introducing DSplats, a novel method that directly denoises multiview images using Gaussian Splat-based Reconstructors to produce a diverse array of realistic 3D assets. To harness the extensive priors of 2D Diffusion Models, we incorporate a pretrained Latent Diffusion Model into the reconstructor backbone to predict a set of 3D Gaussians. Additionally, the explicit 3D representation embedded in the denoising network provides a strong inductive bias, ensuring geometrically consistent novel view generation. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DSplats not only produces high-quality, spatially consistent outputs, but also sets a new standard in single-image to 3D reconstruction. When evaluated on the Google Scanned Objects dataset, DSplats achieves a PSNR of 20.38, an SSIM of 0.842, and an LPIPS of 0.109.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we introduce Select Any Material (SAMa), a material selection approach for various 3D representations. Building on the recently introduced SAM2 video selection model, we extend its capabilities to the material domain. We leverage the model's cross-view consistency to create a 3D-consistent intermediate material-similarity representation in the form of a point cloud from a sparse set of views. Nearest-neighbour lookups in this similarity cloud allow us to efficiently reconstruct accurate continuous selection masks over objects' surfaces that can be inspected from any view. Our method is multiview-consistent by design, alleviating the need for contrastive learning or feature-field pre-processing, and performs optimization-free selection in seconds. Our approach works on arbitrary 3D representations and outperforms several strong baselines in terms of selection accuracy and multiview consistency. It enables several compelling applications, such as replacing the diffuse-textured materials on a text-to-3D output, or selecting and editing materials on NeRFs and 3D-Gaussians.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mfischer-ucl.github.io/sama</p></details> | [Code Link](https://mfischer-ucl.github.io/sama) |

A handful of input images serve as keyframes, and our model interpolates between them to simulate a path moving between the cameras. Given random images, a model's ability to capture underlying geometry, recognize scene identity, and relate frames in terms of camera position and orientation reflects a fundamental understanding of 3D structure and scene layout. However, existing video models such as Luma Dream Machine fail at this task. We design a self-supervised method that takes advantage of the consistency of videos and variability of multiview internet photos to train a scalable, 3D-aware video model without any 3D annotations such as camera parameters. We validate that our method outperforms all baselines in terms of geometric and appearance consistency. We also show our model benefits applications that enable camera control, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Different from prior works that rely on marker-based tracking and multiview cameras, ATS learns natural behaviors of animal and human agents non-invasively through video observations recorded over a long time-span (e.g., a month) in a single environment. Modeling 3D behavior of an agent requires persistent 3D tracking (e.g., knowing which point corresponds to which) over a long time period. To obtain such data, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration method that tracks the agent and the camera over time through a canonical 3D space, resulting in a complete and persistent spacetime 4D representation. We then train a generative model of agent behaviors using paired data of perception and motion of an agent queried from the 4D reconstruction. ATS enables real-to-sim transfer from video recordings of an agent to an interactive behavior simulator. We demonstrate results on pets (e.g., cat, dog, bunny) and human given monocular RGBD videos captured by a smartphone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gengshan-y.github.io/agent2sim-www/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://gengshan-y.github.io/agent2sim-www) |

Understanding the mechanisms underlying protein-DNA interactions is essential for elucidating various life activities. In recent years, machine learning-based models have been prominently utilized for DBP prediction. In this paper, to predict DBPs, we propose a novel framework termed a multiview random vector functional link (MvRVFL) network, which fuses neural network architecture with multiview learning. The proposed MvRVFL model combines the benefits of late and early fusion, allowing for distinct regularization parameters across different views while leveraging a closed-form solution to determine unknown parameters efficiently. The primal objective function incorporates a coupling term aimed at minimizing a composite of errors stemming from all views. From each of the three protein views of the DBP datasets, we extract five features. These features are then fused together by incorporating a hidden feature during the model training process. The performance of the proposed MvRVFL model on the DBP dataset surpasses that of baseline models, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. Furthermore, we extend our assessment to the UCI, KEEL, AwA, and Corel5k datasets, to establish the practicality of the proposed models. The consistency error bound, the generalization error bound, and empirical findings, coupled with rigorous statistical analyses, confirm the superior generalization capabilities of the MvRVFL model compared to the baseline models.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, existing methods struggle with space-view correspondences, resulting in sparse and low-quality outputs. In this paper, we introduce CoSER, a novel consistent dense Multiview Text-to-Image Generator for Text-to-3D, achieving both efficiency and quality by meticulously learning neighbor-view coherence and further alleviating ambiguity through the swift traversal of all views. For achieving neighbor-view consistency, each viewpoint densely interacts with adjacent viewpoints to perceive the global spatial structure, and aggregates information along motion paths explicitly defined by physical principles to refine details. To further enhance cross-view consistency and alleviate content drift, CoSER rapidly scan all views in spiral bidirectional manner to aware holistic information and then scores each point based on semantic material. Subsequently, we conduct weighted down-sampling along the spatial dimension based on scores, thereby facilitating prominent information fusion across all views with lightweight computation. Technically, the core module is built by integrating the attention mechanism with a selective state space model, exploiting the robust learning capabilities of the former and the low overhead of the latter. Extensive evaluation shows that CoSER is capable of producing dense, high-fidelity, content-consistent multiview images that can be flexibly integrated into various 3D generation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite numerous successful multiview-based SVM models, existing frameworks predominantly focus on the consensus principle, often overlooking the complementarity principle. Furthermore, they exhibit limited robustness against noisy, error-prone, and view-inconsistent samples, prevalent in multiview datasets. To tackle the aforementioned limitations, this paper introduces Wave-MvSVM, a novel multiview support vector machine framework leveraging the wave loss (W-loss) function, specifically designed to harness both consensus and complementarity principles. Unlike traditional approaches that often overlook the complementary information among different views, the proposed Wave-MvSVM ensures a more comprehensive and resilient learning process by integrating both principles effectively. The W-loss function, characterized by its smoothness, asymmetry, and bounded nature, is particularly effective in mitigating the adverse effects of noisy and outlier data, thereby enhancing model stability. Theoretically, the W-loss function also exhibits a crucial classification-calibrated property, further boosting its effectiveness. Wave-MvSVM employs a between-view co-regularization term to enforce view consistency and utilizes an adaptive combination weight strategy to maximize the discriminative power of each view. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using a combination of GD and the ADMM, ensuring reliable convergence to optimal solutions. Theoretical analyses, grounded in Rademacher complexity, validate the generalization capabilities of the Wave-MvSVM model. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Wave-MvSVM in comparison to existing benchmark models.</p></details> |  | None |

Several twin support vector machine-based MVL (MvTSVM) models have been introduced and demonstrated outstanding performance in various learning tasks. However, MvTSVM-based models face significant challenges in the form of computational complexity due to four matrix inversions, the need to reformulate optimization problems in order to employ kernel-generated surfaces for handling non-linear cases, and the constraint of uniform noise assumption in the training data. Particularly in cases where the data possesses a heteroscedastic error structure, these challenges become even more pronounced. In view of the aforementioned challenges, we propose multiview twin parametric margin support vector machine (MvTPMSVM). MvTPMSVM constructs parametric margin hyperplanes corresponding to both classes, aiming to regulate and manage the impact of the heteroscedastic noise structure existing within the data. The proposed MvTPMSVM model avoids the explicit computation of matrix inversions in the dual formulation, leading to enhanced computational efficiency. We perform an extensive assessment of the MvTPMSVM model using benchmark datasets such as UCI, KEEL, synthetic, and Animals with Attributes (AwA). Our experimental results, coupled with rigorous statistical analyses, confirm the superior generalization capabilities of the proposed MvTPMSVM model compared to the baseline models.

Recent multiview methods can be classified as sample-contrastive, dimension-contrastive, or asymmetric network-based, with each family having its own approach to avoiding informational collapse. While these families converge to solutions of similar quality, it can be empirically shown that some methods are epoch-inefficient and require longer training to reach a target performance. Two main approaches to improving efficiency are covariance eigenvalue regularization and using more views. However, these two approaches are difficult to combine due to the computational complexity of computing eigenvalues. We present the objective function FroSSL which reconciles both approaches while avoiding eigendecomposition entirely. FroSSL works by minimizing covariance Frobenius norms to avoid collapse and minimizing mean-squared error to achieve augmentation invariance. We show that FroSSL reaches competitive accuracies more quickly than any other SSL method and provide theoretical and empirical support that this faster convergence is due to how FroSSL affects the eigenvalues of the embedding covariance matrices. We also show that FroSSL learns competitive representations on linear probe evaluation when used to train a ResNet-18 on several datasets, including STL-10, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet-100.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 | None |

| **[SMA-Hyper: Spatiotemporal Multi-View Fusion Hypergraph Learning for Traffic Accident Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17642v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting traffic accidents is the key to sustainable city management, which requires effective address of the dynamic and complex spatiotemporal characteristics of cities. Current data-driven models often struggle with data sparsity and typically overlook the integration of diverse urban data sources and the high-order dependencies within them. Additionally, they frequently rely on predefined topologies or weights, limiting their adaptability in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these issues, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Multiview Adaptive HyperGraph Learning (SMA-Hyper) model, a dynamic deep learning framework designed for traffic accident prediction. Building on previous research, this innovative model incorporates dual adaptive spatiotemporal graph learning mechanisms that enable high-order cross-regional learning through hypergraphs and dynamic adaptation to evolving urban data. It also utilises contrastive learning to enhance global and local data representations in sparse datasets and employs an advance attention mechanism to fuse multiple views of accident data and urban functional features, thereby enriching the contextual understanding of risk factors. Extensive testing on the London traffic accident dataset demonstrates that the SMA-Hyper model significantly outperforms baseline models across various temporal horizons and multistep outputs, affirming the effectiveness of its multiview fusion and adaptive learning strategies. The interpretability of the results further underscores its potential to improve urban traffic management and safety by leveraging complex spatiotemporal urban data, offering a scalable framework adaptable to diverse urban environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ConKeD: Multiview contrastive descriptor learning for keypoint-based retinal image registration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05901v2)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal image registration is of utmost importance due to its wide applications in medical practice. In this context, we propose ConKeD, a novel deep learning approach to learn descriptors for retinal image registration. In contrast to current registration methods, our approach employs a novel multi-positive multi-negative contrastive learning strategy that enables the utilization of additional information from the available training samples. This makes it possible to learn high quality descriptors from limited training data. To train and evaluate ConKeD, we combine these descriptors with domain-specific keypoints, particularly blood vessel bifurcations and crossovers, that are detected using a deep neural network. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the novel multi-positive multi-negative strategy, as it outperforms the widely used triplet loss technique (single-positive and single-negative) as well as the single-positive multi-negative alternative. Additionally, the combination of ConKeD with the domain-specific keypoints produces comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods for retinal image registration, while offering important advantages such as avoiding pre-processing, utilizing fewer training samples, and requiring fewer detected keypoints, among others. Therefore, ConKeD shows a promising potential towards facilitating the development and application of deep learning-based methods for retinal image registration.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Structure-Aware Consensus Network on Graphs with Few Labeled Nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02188v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph node classification with few labeled nodes presents significant challenges due to limited supervision. Conventional methods often exploit the graph in a transductive learning manner. They fail to effectively utilize the abundant unlabeled data and the structural information inherent in graphs. To address these issues, we introduce a Structure-Aware Consensus Network (SACN) from three perspectives. Firstly, SACN leverages a novel structure-aware consensus learning strategy between two strongly augmented views. The proposed strategy can fully exploit the potentially useful information of the unlabeled nodes and the structural information of the entire graph. Secondly, SACN uniquely integrates the graph's structural information to achieve strong-to-strong consensus learning, improving the utilization of unlabeled data while maintaining multiview learning. Thirdly, unlike two-branch graph neural network-based methods, SACN is designed for multiview feature learning within a single-branch architecture. Furthermore, a class-aware pseudolabel selection strategy helps address class imbalance and achieve effective weak-to-strong supervision. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate SACN's superior performance in node classification tasks, particularly at very low label rates, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational simplicity.The source code is available at https://github.com/kunzhan/SACN</p></details> | under review | [Code Link](https://github.com/kunzhan/SACN) |

Key to our success is a novel dataset of multiview videos containing curated, rendered animated objects from Objaverse. This dataset depicts 44K diverse objects with 110K animations rendered in 48 viewpoints, resulting in 12M videos with a total of 300M frames. We keep our L4GM simple for scalability and build directly on top of LGM, a pretrained 3D Large Reconstruction Model that outputs 3D Gaussian ellipsoids from multiview image input. L4GM outputs a per-frame 3D Gaussian Splatting representation from video frames sampled at a low fps and then upsamples the representation to a higher fps to achieve temporal smoothness. We add temporal self-attention layers to the base LGM to help it learn consistency across time, and utilize a per-timestep multiview rendering loss to train the model. The representation is upsampled to a higher framerate by training an interpolation model which produces intermediate 3D Gaussian representations. We showcase that L4GM that is only trained on synthetic data generalizes extremely well on in-the-wild videos, producing high quality animated 3D assets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/l4gm</p></details> | None |

From a collection of unannotated 2D images of a scene, our approach simultaneously learns both a network to predict camera pose from 2D image input, as well as the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for the 3D scene. To drive learning, we wrap both the pose prediction network and NeRF inside a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and train the system via the standard denoising objective. Our framework requires the system accomplish the task of denoising an input 2D image by predicting its pose and rendering the NeRF from that pose. Learning to denoise thus forces the system to concurrently learn the underlying 3D NeRF representation and a mapping from images to camera extrinsic parameters. To facilitate the latter, we design a custom network architecture to represent pose as a distribution, granting implicit capacity for discovering view correspondences when trained end-to-end for denoising alone. This technique allows our system to successfully build NeRFs, without pose knowledge, for challenging scenes where competing methods fail. At the conclusion of training, our learned NeRF can be extracted and used as a 3D scene model; our full system can be used to sample novel camera poses and generate novel-view images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, all the existing methods represent the target object as a closed mesh devoid of any structural information, thus neglecting the part-based structure, which is crucial for many downstream applications, of the reconstructed shape. Moreover, the generated meshes usually suffer from large noises, unsmooth surfaces, and blurry textures, making it challenging to obtain satisfactory part segments using 3D segmentation techniques. In this paper, we present Part123, a novel framework for part-aware 3D reconstruction from a single-view image. We first use diffusion models to generate multiview-consistent images from a given image, and then leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM), which demonstrates powerful generalization ability on arbitrary objects, to generate multiview segmentation masks. To effectively incorporate 2D part-based information into 3D reconstruction and handle inconsistency, we introduce contrastive learning into a neural rendering framework to learn a part-aware feature space based on the multiview segmentation masks. A clustering-based algorithm is also developed to automatically derive 3D part segmentation results from the reconstructed models. Experiments show that our method can generate 3D models with high-quality segmented parts on various objects. Compared to existing unstructured reconstruction methods, the part-aware 3D models from our method benefit some important applications, including feature-preserving reconstruction, primitive fitting, and 3D shape editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2024 (conference track),webpage: https://liuar0512.github.io/part123_official_page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://liuar0512.github.io/part123_official_page) |
| **[MIMIC: Masked Image Modeling with Image Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15128v4)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense pixel-specific representation learning at scale has been bottlenecked due to the unavailability of large-scale multi-view datasets. Current methods for building effective pretraining datasets heavily rely on annotated 3D meshes, point clouds, and camera parameters from simulated environments, preventing them from building datasets from real-world data sources where such metadata is lacking. We propose a pretraining dataset-curation approach that does not require any additional annotations. Our method allows us to generate multi-view datasets from both real-world videos and simulated environments at scale. Specifically, we experiment with two scales: MIMIC-1M with 1.3M and MIMIC-3M with 3.1M multi-view image pairs. We train multiple models with different masked image modeling objectives to showcase the following findings: Representations trained on our automatically generated MIMIC-3M outperform those learned from expensive crowdsourced datasets (ImageNet-1K) and those learned from synthetic environments (MULTIVIEW-HABITAT) on two dense geometric tasks: depth estimation on NYUv2 (1.7%), and surface normals estimation on Taskonomy (2.05%). For dense tasks which also require object understanding, we outperform MULTIVIEW-HABITAT, on semantic segmentation on ADE20K (3.89%), pose estimation on MSCOCO (9.4%), and reduce the gap with models pre-trained on the object-centric expensive ImageNet-1K. We outperform even when the representations are frozen, and when downstream training data is limited to few-shot. Larger dataset (MIMIC-3M) significantly improves performance, which is promising since our curation method can arbitrarily scale to produce even larger datasets. MIMIC code, dataset, and pretrained models are open-sourced at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/MIMIC.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/RAIVNLab/MIMIC) |

Regularised linear CCA methods can be seen to generalise Partial Least Squares (PLS) and be unified with a Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP) framework. However, classical algorithms for these linear methods are computationally infeasible for large-scale data. Extensions to Deep CCA show great promise, but current training procedures are slow and complicated. First we propose a novel unconstrained objective that characterizes the top subspace of GEPs. Our core contribution is a family of fast algorithms for stochastic PLS, stochastic CCA, and Deep CCA, simply obtained by applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to the corresponding CCA objectives. Our algorithms show far faster convergence and recover higher correlations than the previous state-of-the-art on all standard CCA and Deep CCA benchmarks. These improvements allow us to perform a first-of-its-kind PLS analysis of an extremely large biomedical dataset from the UK Biobank, with over 33,000 individuals and 500,000 features. Finally, we apply our algorithms to match the performance of `CCA-family' Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and also present theory to clarify the links between these methods and classical CCA, laying the groundwork for future insights.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated their strong feature learning capabilities in MVC scenarios. However, effectively generalizing feature representations while maintaining consistency is still an intractable problem. In addition, most existing deep clustering methods based on contrastive learning overlook the consistency of the clustering representations during the clustering process. In this paper, we show how the above problems can be overcome and propose a consistent enhancement-based deep MVC method via contrastive learning (CCEC). Specifically, semantic connection blocks are incorporated into a feature representation to preserve the consistent information among multiple views. Furthermore, the representation process for clustering is enhanced through spectral clustering, and the consistency across multiple views is improved. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method in comparison with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

We learn pose dependent appearance and geometry from highly accurate dynamic mesh sequences obtained from state-of-the-art multiview-video reconstruction. Learning pose-dependent appearance and geometry from mesh sequences poses significant challenges, as it requires the network to learn the intricate shape and articulated motion of a human body. However, statistical body models like SMPL provide valuable a-priori knowledge which we leverage in order to constrain the dimension of the search space enabling more efficient and targeted learning and define pose-dependency. Instead of directly learning absolute pose-dependent geometry, we learn the difference between the observed geometry and the fitted SMPL model. This allows us to encode both pose-dependent appearance and geometry in the consistent UV space of the SMPL model. This approach not only ensures a high level of realism but also facilitates streamlined processing and rendering of virtual humans in real-time scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

A key challenge lies in finding the exact correspondences between the dense keypoints in multiple views since the inverse of the keypoint mapping can be neither analytically derived nor differentiated. This limits applying existing multiview supervision approaches used to learn sparse keypoints that rely on the exact correspondences. To address this challenge, we derive a new probabilistic epipolar constraint that encodes the two desired properties. (1) Soft correspondence: we define a matchability, which measures a likelihood of a point matching to the other image's corresponding point, thus relaxing the requirement of the exact correspondences. (2) Geometric consistency: every point in the continuous correspondence fields must satisfy the multiview consistency collectively. We formulate a probabilistic epipolar constraint using a weighted average of epipolar errors through the matchability thereby generalizing the point-to-point geometric error to the field-to-field geometric error. This generalization facilitates learning a geometrically coherent dense keypoint detection model by utilizing a large number of unlabeled multiview images. Additionally, to prevent degenerative cases, we employ a distillation-based regularization by using a pretrained model. Finally, we design a new neural network architecture, made of twin networks, that effectively minimizes the probabilistic epipolar errors of all possible correspondences between two view images by building affinity matrices. Our method shows superior performance compared to existing methods, including non-differentiable bootstrapping in terms of keypoint accuracy, multiview consistency, and 3D reconstruction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at NeurIPS 2021</p></details> | None |

We propose iDeepViewLearn (Interpretable Deep Learning Method for Multiview Learning) for learning nonlinear relationships in data from multiple views while achieving feature selection. iDeepViewLearn combines deep learning flexibility with the statistical benefits of data and knowledge-driven feature selection, giving interpretable results. Deep neural networks are used to learn view-independent low-dimensional embedding through an optimization problem that minimizes the difference between observed and reconstructed data, while imposing a regularization penalty on the reconstructed data. The normalized Laplacian of a graph is used to model bilateral relationships between variables in each view, therefore, encouraging selection of related variables. iDeepViewLearn is tested on simulated and two real-world data, including breast cancer-related gene expression and methylation data. iDeepViewLearn had competitive classification results and identified genes and CpG sites that differentiated between individuals who died from breast cancer and those who did not. The results of our real data application and simulations with small to moderate sample sizes suggest that iDeepViewLearn may be a useful method for small-sample-size problems compared to other deep learning methods for multiview learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMC Bioinformatics (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-024-05679-9)</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of anatomical patterns and the random nature of lesion distribution in medical image segmentation pose significant challenges to the disentanglement of representations and the understanding of salient features. Methods guided by the maximization of mutual information, particularly within the framework of contrastive learning, have demonstrated remarkable success and superiority in decoupling densely intertwined representations. However, the effectiveness of contrastive learning highly depends on the quality of the positive and negative sample pairs, i.e. the unselected average mutual information among multi-views would obstruct the learning strategy so the selection of the views is vital. In this work, we introduce a novel approach predicated on representation distance-based mutual information (MI) maximization for measuring the significance of different views, aiming at conducting more efficient contrastive learning and representation disentanglement. Additionally, we introduce an MI re-ranking strategy for representation selection, benefiting both the continuous MI estimating and representation significance distance measuring. Specifically, we harness multi-view representations extracted from the frequency domain, re-evaluating their significance based on mutual information across varying frequencies, thereby facilitating a multifaceted contrastive learning approach to bolster semantic comprehension. The statistical results under the five metrics demonstrate that our proposed framework proficiently constrains the MI maximization-driven representation selection and steers the multi-view contrastive learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 algorithms</p></details> | None |

Recent advances from deep learning have shown promising prospects in fossil image identification. However, the quantity and quality of labeled fossil images are often limited due to fossil preservation, conditioned sampling, and expensive and inconsistent label annotation by domain experts, which pose great challenges to training deep learning based image classification models. To address these challenges, we follow the idea of the wisdom of crowds and propose a multiview ensemble framework, which collects Original (O), Gray (G), and Skeleton (S) views of each fossil image reflecting its different characteristics to train multiple base models, and then makes the final decision via soft voting. Experiments on the largest fusulinid dataset with 2400 images show that the proposed OGS consistently outperforms baselines (using a single model for each view), and obtains superior or comparable performance compared to OOO (using three base models for three the same Original views). Besides, as the training data decreases, the proposed framework achieves more gains. While considering the identification consistency estimation with respect to human experts, OGS receives the highest agreement with the original labels of dataset and with the re-identifications of two human experts. The validation performance provides a quantitative estimation of consistency across different experts and genera. We conclude that the proposed framework can present state-of-the-art performance in the fusulinid fossil identification case study. This framework is designed for general fossil identification and it is expected to see applications to other fossil datasets in future work.

Deep learning-based methods exhibit strong feature learning capabilities on large-scale datasets. For most existing deep MVC methods, exploring the invariant representations of multiple views is still an intractable problem. In this paper, we propose a cross-view contrastive learning (CVCL) method that learns view-invariant representations and produces clustering results by contrasting the cluster assignments among multiple views. Specifically, we first employ deep autoencoders to extract view-dependent features in the pretraining stage. Then, a cluster-level CVCL strategy is presented to explore consistent semantic label information among the multiple views in the fine-tuning stage. Thus, the proposed CVCL method is able to produce more discriminative cluster assignments by virtue of this learning strategy. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of soft cluster assignment alignment. Extensive experimental results obtained on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed CVCL method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Multiview Graph Learning with Consensus Graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13769v1)** | 2024-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph topology inference, i.e., learning graphs from a given set of nodal observations, is a significant task in many application domains. Existing approaches are mostly limited to learning a single graph assuming that the observed data is homogeneous. This is problematic because many modern datasets are heterogeneous or mixed and involve multiple related graphs, i.e., multiview graphs. Recent work proposing to learn multiview graphs ensures the similarity of learned view graphs through pairwise regularization, where each pair of views is encouraged to have similar structures. However, this approach cannot infer the shared structure across views. In this work, we propose an alternative method based on consensus regularization, where views are ensured to be similar through a learned consensus graph representing the common structure of the views. In particular, we propose an optimization problem, where graph data is assumed to be smooth over the multiview graph and the topology of the individual views and that of the consensus graph are learned, simultaneously. Our optimization problem is designed to be general in the sense that different regularization functions can be used depending on what the shared structure across views is. Moreover, we propose two regularization functions that extend fused and group graphical lasso to consensus based regularization. Proposed multiview graph learning is evaluated on simulated data and shown to have better performance than existing methods. It is also employed to infer the functional brain connectivity networks of multiple subjects from their electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The proposed method reveals the structure shared by subjects as well as the characteristics unique to each subject.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often require the same type of data from all views (cross-sectional data only or longitudinal data only) or do not consider any class outcome in the integration method, presenting limitations. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a pipeline that harnesses the power of statistical and deep learning methods to integrate cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources. Additionally, it identifies key variables contributing to the association between views and the separation among classes, providing deeper biological insights. This pipeline includes variable selection/ranking using linear and nonlinear methods, feature extraction using functional principal component analysis and Euler characteristics, and joint integration and classification using dense feed-forward networks and recurrent neural networks. We applied this pipeline to cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-omics data (metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) study and we identified microbial pathways, metabolites, and genes that discriminate by IBD status, providing information on the etiology of IBD. We conducted simulations to compare the two feature extraction methods.

Robustness against these attacks is of the utmost importance when designing computer vision applications, especially for safety-critical domains such as CCTV systems. In most practical situations, monitoring open spaces requires multi-view systems to overcome acquisition challenges such as occlusion handling. Multiview object systems are able to combine data from multiple views, and reach reliable detection results even in difficult environments. Despite its importance in real-world vision applications, the vulnerability of multiview systems to adversarial patches is not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we raise the following question: Does the increased performance and information sharing across views offer as a by-product robustness to adversarial patches? We first conduct a preliminary analysis showing promising robustness against off-the-shelf adversarial patches, even in an extreme setting where we consider patches applied to all views by all persons in Wildtrack benchmark. However, we challenged this observation by proposing two new attacks: (i) In the first attack, targeting a multiview CNN, we maximize the global loss by proposing gradient projection to the different views and aggregating the obtained local gradients. (ii) In the second attack, we focus on a Transformer-based multiview framework. In addition to the focal loss, we also maximize the transformer-specific loss by dissipating its attention blocks. Our results show a large degradation in the detection performance of victim multiview systems with our first patch attack reaching an attack success rate of 73% , while our second proposed attack reduced the performance of its target detector by 62%</p></details> |  | None |

Given a single RGB image or multiview images, our network infers a signed distance function (SDF) discretized on a tetrahedral mesh surrounding the body in a rest pose. Subsequently, inferred pose and camera parameters are used to generate a normal map from the SDF. A key aspect of our approach is the use of Marching Tetrahedra to (uniquely) compute a triangulated surface from the SDF on the tetrahedral mesh, facilitating straightforward differentiation (and thus backpropagation). Thus, given only ground truth normal maps (with no volumetric information ground truth information), we can train the network to produce SDF values from corresponding RGB images. Optionally, an additional multiview loss leads to improved results. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for both network inference and 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising performance and are quickly adopted in change detection. However, the widely used multiple encoder and single decoder (MESD) as well as dual encoder-decoder (DED) architectures still struggle to effectively handle change detection well. The former has problems of bitemporal feature interference in the feature-level fusion, while the latter is inapplicable to intraclass change detection and multiview building change detection. To solve these problems, we propose a new strategy with an exchanging dual encoder-decoder structure for binary change detection with semantic guidance and spatial localization. The proposed strategy solves the problems of bitemporal feature inference in MESD by fusing bitemporal features in the decision level and the inapplicability in DED by determining changed areas using bitemporal semantic features. We build a binary change detection model based on this strategy, and then validate and compare it with 18 state-of-the-art change detection methods on six datasets in three scenarios, including intraclass change detection datasets (CDD, SYSU), single-view building change detection datasets (WHU, LEVIR-CD, LEVIR-CD+) and a multiview building change detection dataset (NJDS).

However, invariance partially or totally removes transformation-related information from the representations, which might harm performance for specific downstream tasks that require such information. We propose 2D strUctured and EquivarianT representations (coined DUET), which are 2d representations organized in a matrix structure, and equivariant with respect to transformations acting on the input data. DUET representations maintain information about an input transformation, while remaining semantically expressive. Compared to SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) (unstructured and invariant) and ESSL (Dangovski et al., 2022) (unstructured and equivariant), the structured and equivariant nature of DUET representations enables controlled generation with lower reconstruction error, while controllability is not possible with SimCLR or ESSL. DUET also achieves higher accuracy for several discriminative tasks, and improves transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2023</p></details> | None |

This thesis focuses on retinal blood vessel segmentation tasks, providing an extensive literature review of deep learning-based medical image segmentation approaches while comparing the methodologies and empirical performances. The work also examines the limitations of current state-of-the-art methods by pointing out the two significant existing limitations: data size constraints and the dependency on high computational resources. To address such problems, this work proposes a novel efficient, simple multiview learning framework that contrastively learns invariant vessel feature representation by comparing with multiple augmented views by various transformations to overcome data shortage and improve generalisation ability. Moreover, the hybrid network architecture integrates the attention mechanism into a Convolutional Neural Network to further capture complex continuous curvilinear vessel structures. The result demonstrates the proposed method validated on the CHASE-DB1 dataset, attaining the highest F1 score of 83.46% and the highest Intersection over Union (IOU) score of 71.62% with UNet structure, surpassing existing benchmark UNet-based methods by 1.95% and 2.8%, respectively. The combination of the metrics indicates the model detects the vessel object accurately with a highly coincidental location with the ground truth. Moreover, the proposed approach could be trained within 30 minutes by consuming less than 3 GB GPU RAM, and such characteristics support the efficient implementation for real-world applications and deployments.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach focuses on maximizing the reuse of visible pixels from the source image. To achieve this, we use a monocular depth estimator that transfers visible pixels from the source view to the target view. Starting from a pre-trained 2D inpainting diffusion model, we train our method on the large-scale Objaverse dataset to learn 3D object priors. While training we use a novel masking mechanism based on epipolar lines to further improve the quality of our approach. This allows our framework to perform zero-shot novel view synthesis on a variety of objects. We evaluate the zero-shot abilities of our framework on three challenging datasets: Google Scanned Objects, Ray Traced Multiview, and Common Objects in 3D.

| **[MSFormer: A Skeleton-multiview Fusion Method For Tooth Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14489v1)** | 2023-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep learning-based tooth segmentation methods have been limited by the expensive and time-consuming processes of data collection and labeling. Achieving high-precision segmentation with limited datasets is critical. A viable solution to this entails fine-tuning pre-trained multiview-based models, thereby enhancing performance with limited data. However, relying solely on two-dimensional (2D) images for three-dimensional (3D) tooth segmentation can produce suboptimal outcomes because of occlusion and deformation, i.e., incomplete and distorted shape perception. To improve this fine-tuning-based solution, this paper advocates 2D-3D joint perception. The fundamental challenge in employing 2D-3D joint perception with limited data is that the 3D-related inputs and modules must follow a lightweight policy instead of using huge 3D data and parameter-rich modules that require extensive training data. Following this lightweight policy, this paper selects skeletons as the 3D inputs and introduces MSFormer, a novel method for tooth segmentation. MSFormer incorporates two lightweight modules into existing multiview-based models: a 3D-skeleton perception module to extract 3D perception from skeletons and a skeleton-image contrastive learning module to obtain the 2D-3D joint perception by fusing both multiview and skeleton perceptions. The experimental results reveal that MSFormer paired with large pre-trained multiview models achieves state-of-the-art performance, requiring only 100 training meshes. Furthermore, the segmentation accuracy is improved by 2.4%-5.5% with the increasing volume of training data.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[Multiview Transformer: Rethinking Spatial Information in Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07186v1)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the land cover category for each pixel in a hyperspectral image (HSI) relies on spectral and spatial information. An HSI cuboid with a specific patch size is utilized to extract spatial-spectral feature representation for the central pixel. In this article, we investigate that scene-specific but not essential correlations may be recorded in an HSI cuboid. This additional information improves the model performance on existing HSI datasets and makes it hard to properly evaluate the ability of a model. We refer to this problem as the spatial overfitting issue and utilize strict experimental settings to avoid it. We further propose a multiview transformer for HSI classification, which consists of multiview principal component analysis (MPCA), spectral encoder-decoder (SED), and spatial-pooling tokenization transformer (SPTT). MPCA performs dimension reduction on an HSI via constructing spectral multiview observations and applying PCA on each view data to extract low-dimensional view representation. The combination of view representations, named multiview representation, is the dimension reduction output of the MPCA. To aggregate the multiview information, a fully-convolutional SED with a U-shape in spectral dimension is introduced to extract a multiview feature map. SPTT transforms the multiview features into tokens using the spatial-pooling tokenization strategy and learns robust and discriminative spatial-spectral features for land cover identification. Classification is conducted with a linear classifier. Experiments on three HSI datasets with rigid settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multiview transformer over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advances in the Neural Radiance Field have predominantly targeted pin-hole cameras, and models for satellite cameras often demand sufficient input views. This paper presents rpcPRF, a Multiplane Images (MPI) based Planar neural Radiance Field for Rational Polynomial Camera (RPC). Unlike coordinate-based neural radiance fields in need of sufficient views of one scene, our model is applicable to single or few inputs and performs well on images from unseen scenes. To enable generalization across scenes, we propose to use reprojection supervision to induce the predicted MPI to learn the correct geometry between the 3D coordinates and the images. Moreover, we remove the stringent requirement of dense depth supervision from deep multiview-stereo-based methods by introducing rendering techniques of radiance fields. rpcPRF combines the superiority of implicit representations and the advantages of the RPC model, to capture the continuous altitude space while learning the 3D structure. Given an RGB image and its corresponding RPC, the end-to-end model learns to synthesize the novel view with a new RPC and reconstruct the altitude of the scene. When multiple views are provided as inputs, rpcPRF exerts extra supervision provided by the extra views. On the TLC dataset from ZY-3, and the SatMVS3D dataset with urban scenes from WV-3, rpcPRF outperforms state-of-the-art nerf-based methods by a significant margin in terms of image fidelity, reconstruction accuracy, and efficiency, for both single-view and multiview task.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose "Maturity-Aware Distribution Breakdown-based Active Learning'' (MADBAL), an AL method that benefits from a hierarchical approach to define a multiview data distribution, which takes into account the different "sample" definitions jointly, hence able to select the most impactful segmentation pixels with comprehensive understanding. MADBAL also features a novel uncertainty formulation, where AL supporting modules are included to sense the features' maturity whose weighted influence continuously contributes to the uncertainty detection. In this way, MADBAL makes significant performance leaps even in the early AL stage, hence reducing the training burden significantly. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets as verified in our extensive experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 34th British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC 2023)</p></details> | None |

In this case, the model aims to learn comprehensive multiview representations while the cross-view semantic information exhibits variations. We propose Semantics-based Unpaired Multiview Learning (SUM-L) to tackle this unpaired multiview learning problem. The key idea is to build cross-view pseudo-pairs and do view-invariant alignment by leveraging the semantic information of videos. To facilitate the data efficiency of multiview learning, we further perform video-text alignment for first-person and third-person videos, to fully leverage the semantic knowledge to improve video representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our framework. Our method also outperforms multiple existing view-alignment methods, under the more challenging scenario than typical paired or unpaired multimodal or multiview learning.

In such graphs, nodes share structural similarity identified by the equivalence of their connectivity which is implicitly encoded in the form of higher-order hierarchical information in the graphs. The contrastive methods are popular choices for learning the representation of nodes in a graph. However, existing contrastive methods struggle to capture higher-order graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multiview contrastive learning approach that integrates diffusion filters on graphs. By incorporating multiple graph views as augmentations, our method captures the structural equivalence in heterophilic graphs, enabling the discovery of hidden relationships and similarities not apparent in traditional node representations. Our approach outperforms baselines on synthetic and real structural datasets, surpassing the best baseline by $16.06\%$ on Cornell, $3.27\%$ on Texas, and $8.04\%$ on Wisconsin. Additionally, it consistently achieves superior performance on proximal tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering structural information and improving downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |

To alleviate the label-hungry limitation, we propose a self-supervised learning framework, HaMuCo, that learns a single-view hand pose estimator from multi-view pseudo 2D labels. However, one of the main challenges of self-supervised learning is the presence of noisy labels and the ``groupthink'' effect from multiple views. To overcome these issues, we introduce a cross-view interaction network that distills the single-view estimator by utilizing the cross-view correlated features and enforcing multi-view consistency to achieve collaborative learning. Both the single-view estimator and the cross-view interaction network are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on multi-view self-supervised hand pose estimation. Furthermore, the proposed cross-view interaction network can also be applied to hand pose estimation from multi-view input and outperforms previous methods under the same settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2023.

This quantity is based on a recently proposed matrix-based entropy that uses the eigenvalues of a normalized Gram matrix to compute an estimate of the eigenvalues of an uncentered covariance operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that a difference of matrix-based entropies (DiME) is well suited for problems involving the maximization of mutual information between random variables. While many methods for such tasks can lead to trivial solutions, DiME naturally penalizes such outcomes. We compare DiME to several baseline estimators of mutual information on a toy Gaussian dataset. We provide examples of use cases for DiME, such as latent factor disentanglement and a multiview representation learning problem where DiME is used to learn a shared representation among views with high mutual information.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Curriculum Learning for Graph Neural Networks: A Multiview Competence-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08859v1)** | 2023-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A curriculum is a planned sequence of learning materials and an effective one can make learning efficient and effective for both humans and machines. Recent studies developed effective data-driven curriculum learning approaches for training graph neural networks in language applications. However, existing curriculum learning approaches often employ a single criterion of difficulty in their training paradigms. In this paper, we propose a new perspective on curriculum learning by introducing a novel approach that builds on graph complexity formalisms (as difficulty criteria) and model competence during training. The model consists of a scheduling scheme which derives effective curricula by accounting for different views of sample difficulty and model competence during training. The proposed solution advances existing research in curriculum learning for graph neural networks with the ability to incorporate a fine-grained spectrum of graph difficulty criteria in their training paradigms. Experimental results on real-world link prediction and node classification tasks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | ACL 2023 | None |

By framing view similarities as dependencies and ensuring contrastivity by imposing orthonormality, HFMCA achieves faster convergence and increased stability in self-supervised learning. HFMCA defines and measures dependencies within image hierarchies, from pixels and patches to full images. We find that the network topology for approximating orthonormal basis functions aligns with a vanilla CNN, enabling the decomposition of density ratios between neighboring layers of feature maps. This approach provides powerful interpretability, revealing the resemblance between supervision and self-supervision through the lens of internal representations.</p></details> |  | None |

These speech data can reveal not only speech content and affective information but the speaker's identity, demographic traits, and health status. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning algorithm that coordinates clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing local data. This algorithm shows enormous potential for SER applications as sharing raw speech or speech features from a user's device is vulnerable to privacy attacks. However, a major challenge in FL is limited availability of high-quality labeled data samples. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised federated learning framework, Semi-FedSER, that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data samples to address the challenge of limited labeled data samples in FL. We show that our Semi-FedSER can generate desired SER performance even when the local label rate l=20 using two SER benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP and MSP-Improv.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted to Insterspeech 2022 for review</p></details> | None |

The proposed methods model nonlinear relationships in multiview data together with predicting a clinical outcome and are capable of identifying variables or groups of variables that best contribute to the relationships among the views. We use the idea that random Fourier bases can approximate shift-invariant kernel functions to construct nonlinear mappings of each view and we use these mappings and the outcome variable to learn view-independent low-dimensional representations. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed methods outperform several other linear and nonlinear methods for multiview data integration. When the proposed methods were applied to gene expression, metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics data pertaining to COVID-19, we identified several molecular signatures forCOVID-19 status and severity.

We then propose an SDF-based neural surface model that leverages this learned neural renderer to represent general scenes. Our model additionally synthesizes indirect illuminations caused by inter-reflections from shiny surfaces by marching surface-reflected rays.

However, the high computational cost associated with multiple views poses a significant challenge for end devices with limited computational resources. To address this issue, we propose a view selection approach that analyzes the target object or scenario from given views and selects the next best view for processing. Our approach features a reinforcement learning based camera selection module, MVSelect, that not only selects views but also facilitates joint training with the task network. Experimental results on multiview classification and detection tasks show that our approach achieves promising performance while using only 2 or 3 out of N available views, significantly reducing computational costs. Furthermore, analysis on the selected views reveals that certain cameras can be shut off with minimal performance impact, shedding light on future camera layout optimization for multiview systems.

The recent promise leverages neural implicit surface learning and differentiable volume rendering, and achieves both the recovery of scene geometry and synthesis of novel views, where deep priors of neural models are used as an inductive smoothness bias. While promising for object-level surfaces, these methods suffer when coping with complex scene surfaces. In the meanwhile, traditional multi-view stereo can recover the geometry of scenes with rich textures, by globally optimizing the local, pixel-wise correspondences across multiple views. We are thus motivated to make use of the complementary benefits from the two strategies, and propose a method termed Helix-shaped neural implicit Surface learning or HelixSurf; HelixSurf uses the intermediate prediction from one strategy as the guidance to regularize the learning of the other one, and conducts such intertwined regularization iteratively during the learning process. We also propose an efficient scheme for differentiable volume rendering in HelixSurf. Experiments on surface reconstruction of indoor scenes show that our method compares favorably with existing methods and is orders of magnitude faster, even when some of existing methods are assisted with auxiliary training data.

Triplet similarity comparison is a type of crowdsourcing task, in which crowd workers are asked the question ``among three given objects, which two are more similar?'', which is relatively easy for humans to answer. However, the comparison can be sometimes based on multiple views, i.e., different independent attributes such as color and shape. Each view may lead to different results for the same three objects. Although an algorithm was proposed in prior work to produce multiview embeddings, it involves at least two problems: (1) the existing algorithm cannot independently predict multiview embeddings for a new sample, and (2) different people may prefer different views. In this study, we propose an end-to-end inductive deep learning framework to solve the multiview representation learning problem. The results show that our proposed method can obtain multiview embeddings of any object, in which each view corresponds to an independent attribute of the object. We collected two datasets from a crowdsourcing platform to experimentally investigate the performance of our proposed approach compared to conventional baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables, Accepted for WWW 2023</p></details> | None |

Structural-level CL push the potential subspace structures consistent in any two cross views, which assists sample-level CL to extract discriminative features more effectively. Furthermore, it is proven that the relationships between structural-level CL and mutual information and probabilistic intraand inter-scatter, which provides the theoretical support for the excellent performance.

Existing approaches usually pretrain protein language models on a large number of unlabeled amino acid sequences and then finetune the models with some labeled data in downstream tasks. Despite the effectiveness of sequence-based approaches, the power of pretraining on known protein structures, which are available in smaller numbers only, has not been explored for protein property prediction, though protein structures are known to be determinants of protein function. In this paper, we propose to pretrain protein representations according to their 3D structures. We first present a simple yet effective encoder to learn the geometric features of a protein. We pretrain the protein graph encoder by leveraging multiview contrastive learning and different self-prediction tasks. Experimental results on both function prediction and fold classification tasks show that our proposed pretraining methods outperform or are on par with the state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, while using much less pretraining data.

| **[Multiview Compressive Coding for 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08247v1)** | 2023-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central goal of visual recognition is to understand objects and scenes from a single image. 2D recognition has witnessed tremendous progress thanks to large-scale learning and general-purpose representations. Comparatively, 3D poses new challenges stemming from occlusions not depicted in the image. Prior works try to overcome these by inferring from multiple views or rely on scarce CAD models and category-specific priors which hinder scaling to novel settings. In this work, we explore single-view 3D reconstruction by learning generalizable representations inspired by advances in self-supervised learning. We introduce a simple framework that operates on 3D points of single objects or whole scenes coupled with category-agnostic large-scale training from diverse RGB-D videos. Our model, Multiview Compressive Coding (MCC), learns to compress the input appearance and geometry to predict the 3D structure by querying a 3D-aware decoder. MCC's generality and efficiency allow it to learn from large-scale and diverse data sources with strong generalization to novel objects imagined by DALL$\cdot$E 2 or captured in-the-wild with an iPhone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mcc3d.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, challenges remain on designing an attention mechanism to explore the multiview features and exploit their relations for reinforcing the encoding-decoding modules. This paper proposes a new model, namely 3D coarse-to-fine transformer (3D-C2FT), by introducing a novel coarse-to-fine(C2F) attention mechanism for encoding multi-view features and rectifying defective 3D objects. C2F attention mechanism enables the model to learn multi-view information flow and synthesize 3D surface correction in a coarse to fine-grained manner. The proposed model is evaluated by ShapeNet and Multi-view Real-life datasets. Experimental results show that 3D-C2FT achieves notable results and outperforms several competing models on these datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2022</p></details> | None |
| **[A Generalized EigenGame with Extensions to Multiview Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11323v3)** | 2023-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) encompass a range of interesting dimensionality reduction methods. Development of efficient stochastic approaches to these problems would allow them to scale to larger datasets. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is one example of a GEP for dimensionality reduction which has found extensive use in problems with two or more views of the data. Deep learning extensions of CCA require large mini-batch sizes, and therefore large memory consumption, in the stochastic setting to achieve good performance and this has limited its application in practice. Inspired by the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm, we develop an approach to solving stochastic GEPs in which all constraints are softly enforced by Lagrange multipliers. Then by considering the integral of this Lagrangian function, its pseudo-utility, and inspired by recent formulations of Principal Components Analysis and GEPs as games with differentiable utilities, we develop a game-theory inspired approach to solving GEPs. We show that our approaches share much of the theoretical grounding of the previous Hebbian and game theoretic approaches for the linear case but our method permits extension to general function approximators like neural networks for certain GEPs for dimensionality reduction including CCA which means our method can be used for deep multiview representation learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for solving GEPs in the stochastic setting using canonical multiview datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for optimizing Deep CCA.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Correspondence Estimation via Multiview Registration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03236v1)** | 2022-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video provides us with the spatio-temporal consistency needed for visual learning. Recent approaches have utilized this signal to learn correspondence estimation from close-by frame pairs. However, by only relying on close-by frame pairs, those approaches miss out on the richer long-range consistency between distant overlapping frames. To address this, we propose a self-supervised approach for correspondence estimation that learns from multiview consistency in short RGB-D video sequences. Our approach combines pairwise correspondence estimation and registration with a novel SE(3) transformation synchronization algorithm. Our key insight is that self-supervised multiview registration allows us to obtain correspondences over longer time frames; increasing both the diversity and difficulty of sampled pairs. We evaluate our approach on indoor scenes for correspondence estimation and RGB-D pointcloud registration and find that we perform on-par with supervised approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2023.

Occlusions and obstacles in large environments are often challenging situations for navigation agents because the environment is not fully observable from a single camera view. Given multiple camera views of an environment, our approach learns to produce a multiview scene representation that can only be used for navigation, provably preventing one party from inferring anything beyond the output task. On a new navigation dataset that we will publicly release, experiments show that private multiparty representations allow navigation through complex scenes and around obstacles while jointly preserving privacy. Our approach scales to an arbitrary number of camera viewpoints. We believe developing visual representations that preserve privacy is increasingly important for many applications such as navigation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Local Manifold Augmentation for Multiview Semantic Consistency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02798v1)** | 2022-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview self-supervised representation learning roots in exploring semantic consistency across data of complex intra-class variation. Such variation is not directly accessible and therefore simulated by data augmentations. However, commonly adopted augmentations are handcrafted and limited to simple geometrical and color changes, which are unable to cover the abundant intra-class variation. In this paper, we propose to extract the underlying data variation from datasets and construct a novel augmentation operator, named local manifold augmentation (LMA). LMA is achieved by training an instance-conditioned generator to fit the distribution on the local manifold of data and sampling multiview data using it. LMA shows the ability to create an infinite number of data views, preserve semantics, and simulate complicated variations in object pose, viewpoint, lighting condition, background etc. Experiments show that with LMA integrated, self-supervised learning methods such as MoCov2 and SimSiam gain consistent improvement on prevalent benchmarks including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, ImageNet100, and ImageNet. Furthermore, LMA leads to representations that obtain more significant invariance to the viewpoint, object pose, and illumination changes and stronger robustness to various real distribution shifts reflected by ImageNet-V2, ImageNet-R, ImageNet Sketch etc.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Multi-view Representation Learning from Malware to Defend Against Adversarial Variants](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15429v1)** | 2022-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based adversarial malware detectors have yielded promising results in detecting never-before-seen malware executables without relying on expensive dynamic behavior analysis and sandbox. Despite their abilities, these detectors have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial malware variants - meticulously modified, functionality-preserving versions of original malware executables generated by machine learning. Due to the nature of these adversarial modifications, these adversarial methods often use a \textit{single view} of malware executables (i.e., the binary/hexadecimal view) to generate adversarial malware variants. This provides an opportunity for the defenders (i.e., malware detectors) to detect the adversarial variants by utilizing more than one view of a malware file (e.g., source code view in addition to the binary view). The rationale behind this idea is that while the adversary focuses on the binary view, certain characteristics of the malware file in the source code view remain untouched which leads to the detection of the adversarial malware variants. To capitalize on this opportunity, we propose Adversarially Robust Multiview Malware Defense (ARMD), a novel multi-view learning framework to improve the robustness of DL-based malware detectors against adversarial variants. Our experiments on three renowned open-source deep learning-based malware detectors across six common malware categories show that ARMD is able to improve the adversarial robustness by up to seven times on these malware detectors.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cooperative learning for multiview analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12337v6)** | 2022-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method for supervised learning with multiple sets of features ("views"). The multiview problem is especially important in biology and medicine, where "-omics" data such as genomics, proteomics and radiomics are measured on a common set of samples. Cooperative learning combines the usual squared error loss of predictions with an "agreement" penalty to encourage the predictions from different data views to agree. By varying the weight of the agreement penalty, we get a continuum of solutions that include the well-known early and late fusion approaches. Cooperative learning chooses the degree of agreement (or fusion) in an adaptive manner, using a validation set or cross-validation to estimate test set prediction error. One version of our fitting procedure is modular, where one can choose different fitting mechanisms (e.g. lasso, random forests, boosting, neural networks) appropriate for different data views. In the setting of cooperative regularized linear regression, the method combines the lasso penalty with the agreement penalty, yielding feature sparsity. The method can be especially powerful when the different data views share some underlying relationship in their signals that can be exploited to boost the signals. We show that cooperative learning achieves higher predictive accuracy on simulated data and a real multiomics example of labor onset prediction. Leveraging aligned signals and allowing flexible fitting mechanisms for different modalities, cooperative learning offers a powerful approach to multiomics data fusion.</p></details> |  | None |

Each of the possible input modalities describes human behaviour in a different way, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. We explore the hypothesis that leveraging multiple modalities can lead to better recognition. Since manual annotation of input data is expensive and time-consuming, the emphasis is made on self-supervised methods which can learn useful feature representations without any ground truth labels. We extend a number of recent contrastive self-supervised approaches for the task of Human Activity Recognition, leveraging inertial and skeleton data. Furthermore, we propose a flexible, general-purpose framework for performing multimodal self-supervised learning, named Contrastive Multiview Coding with Cross-Modal Knowledge Mining (CMC-CMKM). This framework exploits modality-specific knowledge in order to mitigate the limitations of typical self-supervised frameworks. The extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate that the suggested framework significantly outperforms contrastive unimodal and multimodal baselines on different scenarios, including fully-supervised fine-tuning, activity retrieval and semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, it shows performance competitive even compared to supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in IEEE WCCI 2022 (IJCNN 2022 track)</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptively-weighted Integral Space for Fast Multiview Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12808v1)** | 2022-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview clustering has been extensively studied to take advantage of multi-source information to improve the clustering performance. In general, most of the existing works typically compute an n * n affinity graph by some similarity/distance metrics (e.g. the Euclidean distance) or learned representations, and explore the pairwise correlations across views. But unfortunately, a quadratic or even cubic complexity is often needed, bringing about difficulty in clustering largescale datasets. Some efforts have been made recently to capture data distribution in multiple views by selecting view-wise anchor representations with k-means, or by direct matrix factorization on the original observations. Despite the significant success, few of them have considered the view-insufficiency issue, implicitly holding the assumption that each individual view is sufficient to recover the cluster structure. Moreover, the latent integral space as well as the shared cluster structure from multiple insufficient views is not able to be simultaneously discovered. In view of this, we propose an Adaptively-weighted Integral Space for Fast Multiview Clustering (AIMC) with nearly linear complexity. Specifically, view generation models are designed to reconstruct the view observations from the latent integral space with diverse adaptive contributions. Meanwhile, a centroid representation with orthogonality constraint and cluster partition are seamlessly constructed to approximate the latent integral space. An alternate minimizing algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem, which is proved to have linear time complexity w.r.t. the sample size. Extensive experiments conducted on several realworld datasets confirm the superiority of the proposed AIMC method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Contrastive learning approaches have shown promising performance in this task. However, they neglect the semantic consistency between fused and view representations and have difficulty in modeling complementary information between different views. To deal with these deficiencies, this work presents a novel Contrastive leaRning framEwork for Multiview network Embedding (CREME). In our work, different views can be obtained based on the various relations among nodes. Then, we generate view embeddings via proper view encoders and utilize an attentive multiview aggregator to fuse these representations. Particularly, we design two collaborative contrastive objectives, view fusion InfoMax and inter-view InfoMin, to train the model in a self-supervised manner. The former objective distills information from embeddings generated from different views, while the latter captures complementary information among views to promote distinctive view embeddings. We also show that the two objectives can be unified into one objective for model training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed CREME is able to consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted to CIKM 2022</p></details> | None |
| **[Multiview Regenerative Morphing with Dual Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01287v1)** | 2022-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to address a new task of image morphing under a multiview setting, which takes two sets of multiview images as the input and generates intermediate renderings that not only exhibit smooth transitions between the two input sets but also ensure visual consistency across different views at any transition state. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach called Multiview Regenerative Morphing that formulates the morphing process as an optimization to solve for rigid transformation and optimal-transport interpolation. Given the multiview input images of the source and target scenes, we first learn a volumetric representation that models the geometry and appearance for each scene to enable the rendering of novel views. Then, the morphing between the two scenes is obtained by solving optimal transport between the two volumetric representations in Wasserstein metrics. Our approach does not rely on user-specified correspondences or 2D/3D input meshes, and we do not assume any predefined categories of the source and target scenes. The proposed view-consistent interpolation scheme directly works on multiview images to yield a novel and visually plausible effect of multiview free-form morphing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MPS-NeRF: Generalizable 3D Human Rendering from Multiview Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16875v2)** | 2022-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been rapid progress recently on 3D human rendering, including novel view synthesis and pose animation, based on the advances of neural radiance fields (NeRF). However, most existing methods focus on person-specific training and their training typically requires multi-view videos. This paper deals with a new challenging task -- rendering novel views and novel poses for a person unseen in training, using only multiview images as input. For this task, we propose a simple yet effective method to train a generalizable NeRF with multiview images as conditional input. The key ingredient is a dedicated representation combining a canonical NeRF and a volume deformation scheme. Using a canonical space enables our method to learn shared properties of human and easily generalize to different people. Volume deformation is used to connect the canonical space with input and target images and query image features for radiance and density prediction. We leverage the parametric 3D human model fitted on the input images to derive the deformation, which works quite well in practice when combined with our canonical NeRF. The experiments on both real and synthetic data with the novel view synthesis and pose animation tasks collectively demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

Surprisingly, an extension of these methods to the multiview domain is relatively unexplored. A successful multiview policy could be deployed on a mobile manipulation platform, allowing the robot to complete a task regardless of its view of the scene. In this work, we demonstrate that a multiview policy can be found through imitation learning by collecting data from a variety of viewpoints. We illustrate the general applicability of the method by learning to complete several challenging multi-stage and contact-rich tasks, from numerous viewpoints, both in a simulated environment and on a real mobile manipulation platform. Furthermore, we analyze our policies to determine the benefits of learning from multiview data compared to learning with data collected from a fixed perspective. We show that learning from multiview data results in little, if any, penalty to performance for a fixed-view task compared to learning with an equivalent amount of fixed-view data. Finally, we examine the visual features learned by the multiview and fixed-view policies. Our results indicate that multiview policies implicitly learn to identify spatially correlated features.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'21), Prague, Czech Republic, Sep. 27 - Oct. 1, 2021</p></details> | None |

Natural views are often handled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation analysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., BYOL and Barlow Twins. Both types of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that the embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although intuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is mostly empirically validated. This work aims to understand latent correlation maximization-based deep multiview learning from a latent component identification viewpoint. An intuitive generative model of multiview data is adopted, where the views are different nonlinear mixtures of shared and private components. Since the shared components are view/distortion-invariant, representing the data using such components is believed to reveal the identity of the samples effectively and robustly. Under this model, latent correlation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared components across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, it is further shown that the private information in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using proper regularization design. A finite sample analysis, which has been rare in nonlinear mixture identifiability study, is also presented. The theoretical results and newly designed regularization are tested on a series of tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2022 Spotlight, 37 pages, 11 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Generative Models as a Data Source for Multiview Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05258v3)** | 2022-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models are now capable of producing highly realistic images that look nearly indistinguishable from the data on which they are trained. This raises the question: if we have good enough generative models, do we still need datasets? We investigate this question in the setting of learning general-purpose visual representations from a black-box generative model rather than directly from data. Given an off-the-shelf image generator without any access to its training data, we train representations from the samples output by this generator. We compare several representation learning methods that can be applied to this setting, using the latent space of the generator to generate multiple "views" of the same semantic content. We show that for contrastive methods, this multiview data can naturally be used to identify positive pairs (nearby in latent space) and negative pairs (far apart in latent space). We find that the resulting representations rival or even outperform those learned directly from real data, but that good performance requires care in the sampling strategy applied and the training method. Generative models can be viewed as a compressed and organized copy of a dataset, and we envision a future where more and more "model zoos" proliferate while datasets become increasingly unwieldy, missing, or private. This paper suggests several techniques for dealing with visual representation learning in such a future.

Face clustering for long-form content is challenging because of variations in appearance and lack of supporting large-scale labeled data. Our work in this paper focuses on two key aspects of this problem: the lack of domain-specific training or benchmark datasets, and adapting face embeddings learned on web images to long-form content, specifically movies. First, we present a dataset of over 169,000 face tracks curated from 240 Hollywood movies with weak labels on whether a pair of face tracks belong to the same or a different character. We propose an offline algorithm based on nearest-neighbor search in the embedding space to mine hard-examples from these tracks. We then investigate triplet-loss and multiview correlation-based methods for adapting face embeddings to hard-examples. Our experimental results highlight the usefulness of weakly labeled data for domain-specific feature adaptation. Overall, we find that multiview correlation-based adaptation yields more discriminative and robust face embeddings. Its performance on downstream face verification and clustering tasks is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art results in this domain. We also present the SAIL-Movie Character Benchmark corpus developed to augment existing benchmarks. It consists of racially diverse actors and provides face-quality labels for subsequent error analysis. We hope that the large-scale datasets developed in this work can further advance automatic character labeling in videos.

More specifically, we extract discharge summaries of patients from their EHRs, and represent them with multiview graphs enhanced by an external knowledge graph. Graph convolutional networks are then used for representation learning.

However, all of them failed to consider the difficulty labels (uncertainty of ground-truth for training samples) over multi-view samples, which may result into a nonideal clustering network for getting stuck into poor local optima during training process; worse still, the difficulty labels from multi-view samples are always inconsistent, such fact makes it even more challenging to handle. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Adversarial Inconsistent Cognitive Sampling (DAICS) method for multi-view progressive subspace clustering. A multiview binary classification (easy or difficult) loss and a feature similarity loss are proposed to jointly learn a binary classifier and a deep consistent feature embedding network, throughout an adversarial minimax game over difficulty labels of multiview consistent samples. We develop a multi-view cognitive sampling strategy to select the input samples from easy to difficult for multi-view clustering network training. However, the distributions of easy and difficult samples are mixed together, hence not trivial to achieve the goal. To resolve it, we define a sampling probability with theoretical guarantee. Based on that, a golden section mechanism is further designed to generate a sample set boundary to progressively select the samples with varied difficulty labels via a gate unit, which is utilized to jointly learn a multi-view common progressive subspace and clustering network for more efficient clustering. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DAICS over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

We explore how to design a graph neural network specially for unsupervised multiview learning and integrate multiple graphs into a unified consensus graph by a shared self-attentional module. The view-shared self-attentional module utilizes the graph structure to learn a view-consistent global graph. Meanwhile, instead of using auto-encoder in most unsupervised learning graph neural networks, SDSNE uses a co-supervised strategy with structure information to supervise the model learning. The co-supervised strategy as the loss function guides SDSNE in achieving the stationary state. With the help of the loss and the self-attentional module, we learn to obtain a graph in which nodes in each connected component fully connect by the same weight. Experiments on several multiview datasets demonstrate effectiveness of SDSNE in terms of six clustering evaluation metrics.</p></details> | AAAI 2022 | None |
| **[Deep Permutation Equivariant Structure from Motion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06703v3)** | 2021-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing deep methods produce highly accurate 3D reconstructions in stereo and multiview stereo settings, i.e., when cameras are both internally and externally calibrated. Nevertheless, the challenge of simultaneous recovery of camera poses and 3D scene structure in multiview settings with deep networks is still outstanding. Inspired by projective factorization for Structure from Motion (SFM) and by deep matrix completion techniques, we propose a neural network architecture that, given a set of point tracks in multiple images of a static scene, recovers both the camera parameters and a (sparse) scene structure by minimizing an unsupervised reprojection loss. Our network architecture is designed to respect the structure of the problem: the sought output is equivariant to permutations of both cameras and scene points. Notably, our method does not require initialization of camera parameters or 3D point locations. We test our architecture in two setups: (1) single scene reconstruction and (2) learning from multiple scenes. Our experiments, conducted on a variety of datasets in both internally calibrated and uncalibrated settings, indicate that our method accurately recovers pose and structure, on par with classical state of the art methods. Additionally, we show that a pre-trained network can be used to reconstruct novel scenes using inexpensive fine-tuning with no loss of accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Knowledge-Guided Multiview Deep Curriculum Learning for Elbow Fracture Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10383v1)** | 2021-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elbow fracture diagnosis often requires patients to take both frontal and lateral views of elbow X-ray radiographs. In this paper, we propose a multiview deep learning method for an elbow fracture subtype classification task. Our strategy leverages transfer learning by first training two single-view models, one for frontal view and the other for lateral view, and then transferring the weights to the corresponding layers in the proposed multiview network architecture. Meanwhile, quantitative medical knowledge was integrated into the training process through a curriculum learning framework, which enables the model to first learn from "easier" samples and then transition to "harder" samples to reach better performance. In addition, our multiview network can work both in a dual-view setting and with a single view as input. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments on a classification task of elbow fracture with a dataset of 1,964 images. Results show that our method outperforms two related methods on bone fracture study in multiple settings, and our technique is able to boost the performance of the compared methods.

Our collision detector is represented as a bilevel deep autoencoder with an attention mechanism that identifies colliding mesh sub-parts. We use a numerical optimization algorithm to resolve penetrations guided by the network. Our learned collision handler can resolve collisions for unseen, high-dimensional meshes with thousands of vertices. To obtain stable network performance in such large and unseen spaces, we progressively insert new collision data based on the errors in network inferences. We automatically label these data using an analytical collision detector and progressively fine-tune our detection networks. We evaluate our method for collision handling of complex, 3D meshes coming from several datasets with different shapes and topologies, including datasets corresponding to dressed and undressed human poses, cloth simulations, and human hand poses acquired using multiview capture systems. Our approach outperforms supervised learning methods and achieves $93.8-98.1\%$ accuracy compared to the groundtruth by analytic methods. Compared to prior learning methods, our approach results in a $5.16\%-25.50\%$ lower false negative rate in terms of collision checking and a $9.65\%-58.91\%$ higher success rate in collision handling.</p></details> |  | None |

Such tracking promises important advances in biology and biomedicine. Modern tracking models depend critically on labor-intensive annotated datasets of primary landmarks by non-expert humans. However, such annotation approaches can be costly and impractical for secondary landmarks, that is, ones that reflect fine-grained geometry of animals, and that are often specific to customized behavioral tasks. Due to visual and geometric ambiguity, nonexperts are often not qualified for secondary landmark annotation, which can require anatomical and zoological knowledge. These barriers significantly impede downstream behavioral studies because the learned tracking models exhibit limited generalizability. We hypothesize that there exists a shared representation between the primary and secondary landmarks because the range of motion of the secondary landmarks can be approximately spanned by that of the primary landmarks. We present a method to learn this spatial relationship of the primary and secondary landmarks in three dimensional space, which can, in turn, self-supervise the secondary landmark detector. This 3D representation learning is generic, and can therefore be applied to various multiview settings across diverse organisms, including macaques, flies, and humans.</p></details> |  | None |

Representation learning for model initialization has recently been actively studied in the remote sensing field. In particular, the appearance characteristics of the imagery obtained using the a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor are quite different from those of general electro-optical (EO) images, and thus representation learning is even more important in remote sensing domain. Motivated from contrastive multiview coding, we propose multi-modal representation learning for SAR semantic segmentation. Unlike previous studies, our method jointly uses EO imagery, SAR imagery, and a label mask. Several experiments show that our approach is superior to the existing methods in model performance, sample efficiency, and convergence speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be appeared in IEEE GRSL.

However, supervised learning based methods perform poorly when the training data and the test data have different distributions. Indeed, most current works perform satisfactorily on the synthetic ShapeNet dataset, but dramatically fail in when presented with real world images. To address this issue, unsupervised domain adaptation can be used transfer knowledge from the labeled synthetic source domain and learn a classifier for the unlabeled real target domain. To tackle this challenge of single view 3D reconstruction in the real domain, we experiment with a variety of domain adaptation techniques inspired by the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss, Deep CORAL, and the domain adversarial neural network (DANN). From these findings, we additionally propose a novel architecture which takes advantage of the fact that in this setting, target domain data is unsupervised with regards to the 3D model but supervised for class labels. We base our framework off a recent network called pix2vox. Results are performed with ShapeNet as the source domain and domains within the Object Dataset Domain Suite (ODDS) dataset as the target, which is a real world multiview, multidomain image dataset. The domains in ODDS vary in difficulty, allowing us to assess notions of domain gap size. Our results are the first in the multiview reconstruction literature using this dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

With the renaissance of deep learning, automatic diagnostic systems for computed tomography (CT) have achieved many successful applications. However, they are mostly attributed to careful expert annotations, which are often scarce in practice. This drives our interest to the unsupervised representation learning. \emph{Introduction}. Recent studies have shown that self-supervised learning is an effective approach for learning representations, but most of them rely on the empirical design of transformations and pretext tasks. \emph{Methods}. To avoid the subjectivity associated with these methods, we propose the MVCNet, a novel unsupervised three dimensional (3D) representation learning method working in a transformation-free manner. We view each 3D lesion from different orientations to collect multiple two dimensional (2D) views. Then, an embedding function is learned by minimizing a contrastive loss so that the 2D views of the same 3D lesion are aggregated, and the 2D views of different lesions are separated. We evaluate the representations by training a simple classification head upon the embedding layer. \emph{Results}. Experimental results show that MVCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on the LIDC-IDRI (89.55\%), LNDb (77.69\%) and TianChi (79.96\%) datasets for \emph{unsupervised representation learning}. When fine-tuned on 10\% of the labeled data, the accuracies are comparable to the supervised learning model (89.46\% vs. 85.03\%, 73.85\% vs. 73.44\%, 83.56\% vs. 83.34\% on the three datasets, respectively). \emph{Conclusion}. Results indicate the superiority of MVCNet in \emph{learning representations with limited annotations}.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This 16-page manuscript has been submitted to Meidcal Image Analysis for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Nowadays, as the embodiment of innovation, the diversity of the industrial goods is significantly larger, in which the incomplete multiview, multimodal and multilabel are different from the traditional dataset. In this paper, we introduce an industrial goods dataset, namely PatentNet, with numerous highly diverse, accurate and detailed annotations of industrial goods images, and corresponding texts. In PatentNet, the images and texts are sourced from design patent. Within over 6M images and corresponding texts of industrial goods labeled manually checked by professionals, PatentNet is the first ongoing industrial goods image database whose varieties are wider than industrial goods datasets used previously for benchmarking. PatentNet organizes millions of images into 32 classes and 219 subclasses based on the Locarno Classification Agreement. Through extensive experiments on image classification, image retrieval and incomplete multiview clustering, we demonstrate that our PatentNet is much more diverse, complex, and challenging, enjoying higher potentials than existing industrial image datasets. Furthermore, the characteristics of incomplete multiview, multimodal and multilabel in PatentNet are able to offer unparalleled opportunities in the artificial intelligence community and beyond.</p></details> | 12 pages,7 figures | None |

A fundamental question in multiview analysis is what is the additional information brought by additional views and can quantitatively identify this additional information. In this work, we try to tackle this challenge by decomposing the entangled multiview features into shared latent representations that are common across all views and private representations that are specific to each single view. We formulate this feature disentanglement in the framework of information bottleneck and propose disentangled variational information bottleneck (DVIB). DVIB explicitly defines the properties of shared and private representations using constrains from mutual information. By deriving variational upper and lower bounds of mutual information terms, representations are efficiently optimized. We demonstrate the shared and private representations learned by DVIB well preserve the common labels shared between two views and unique labels corresponding to each single view, respectively. DVIB also shows comparable performance in classification task on images with corruptions. DVIB implementation is available at https://github.com/feng-bao-ucsf/DVIB.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/feng-bao-ucsf/DVIB) |

Unlike previous works that have exploited polarization to estimate material or object appearance under certain constraints (known shape or multiview acquisition), we lift such restrictions by coupling polarization imaging with deep learning to achieve high quality estimate of 3D object shape (surface normals and depth) and SVBRDF using single-view polarization imaging under frontal flash illumination. In addition to acquired polarization images, we provide our deep network with strong novel cues related to shape and reflectance, in the form of a normalized Stokes map and an estimate of diffuse color. We additionally describe modifications to network architecture and training loss which provide further qualitative improvements. We demonstrate our approach to achieve superior results compared to recent works employing deep learning in conjunction with flash illumination.</p></details> | CVPR 2021 Oral paper | None |

Our proposed end-to-end framework is based on a joint learning of multiple unpaired image-to-image translation models, one per camera viewpoint. The joint learning is imposed by constraints on the shared 3D human pose in order to encourage the 2D pose projections in all views to be consistent.

The complementary views help obtain more reliable pseudo-labels on unlabeled video, to learn stronger video representations than from purely supervised data. Though our method capitalizes on multiple views, it nonetheless trains a model that is shared across appearance and motion input and thus, by design, incurs no additional computation overhead at inference time. On multiple video recognition datasets, our method substantially outperforms its supervised counterpart, and compares favorably to previous work on standard benchmarks in self-supervised video representation learning.</p></details> | Technical report | None |

Despite training efforts and substantial advancement in ultrasound technology over the past years, CHD remains an abnormality that is frequently missed during prenatal ultrasonography. Therefore, computer-aided detection of CHD can play a critical role in prenatal care by improving screening and diagnosis. Since many CHDs involve structural abnormalities, automatic segmentation of anatomical structures is an important step in the analysis of fetal echocardiograms. While existing methods mainly focus on the four-chamber view with a small number of structures, here we present a more comprehensive deep learning segmentation framework covering 14 anatomical structures in both three-vessel trachea and four-chamber views. Specifically, our framework enhances the V-Net with spatial dropout, group normalization, and deep supervision to train a segmentation model that can be applied on both views regardless of abnormalities. By identifying the pitfall of using the Dice loss when some labels are unavailable in some images, this framework integrates information from multiple views and is robust to missing structures due to anatomical anomalies, achieving an average Dice score of 79%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by SPIE Medical Imaging 2021</p></details> | None |

The network takes an RGB image as input, regresses albedo, shadow and normal maps from which we infer least squares optimal spherical harmonic lighting coefficients. Our network is trained using large uncontrolled multiview and timelapse image collections without ground truth. By incorporating a differentiable renderer, our network can learn from self-supervision. Since the problem is ill-posed we introduce additional supervision. Our key insight is to perform offline multiview stereo (MVS) on images containing rich illumination variation. From the MVS pose and depth maps, we can cross project between overlapping views such that Siamese training can be used to ensure consistent estimation of photometric invariants. MVS depth also provides direct coarse supervision for normal map estimation. We believe this is the first attempt to use MVS supervision for learning inverse rendering. In addition, we learn a statistical natural illumination prior.

The 3D pose of the pre-intervention volume is then estimated through a triangulation layer. In $\text{POINT}^2$, the unified framework of the POI tracker and the triangulation layer enables learning informative 2D features and estimating 3D pose jointly. In contrast to existing approaches, $\text{POINT}^2$ only requires a single forward-pass to achieve a reliable 2D/3D registration. As the POI tracker is shift-invariant, $\text{POINT}^2$ is more robust to the initial pose of the 3D pre-intervention image. Extensive experiments on a large-scale clinical cone-beam CT (CBCT) dataset show that the proposed $\text{POINT}^2$ method outperforms the existing learning-based method in terms of accuracy, robustness and running time. Furthermore, when used as an initial pose estimator, our method also improves the robustness and speed of the state-of-the-art optimization-based approaches by ten folds.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to CVPR 2019</p></details> | None |
| **[Contrastive Multiview Coding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05849v5)** | 2020-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans view the world through many sensory channels, e.g., the long-wavelength light channel, viewed by the left eye, or the high-frequency vibrations channel, heard by the right ear. Each view is noisy and incomplete, but important factors, such as physics, geometry, and semantics, tend to be shared between all views (e.g., a "dog" can be seen, heard, and felt). We investigate the classic hypothesis that a powerful representation is one that models view-invariant factors. We study this hypothesis under the framework of multiview contrastive learning, where we learn a representation that aims to maximize mutual information between different views of the same scene but is otherwise compact. Our approach scales to any number of views, and is view-agnostic. We analyze key properties of the approach that make it work, finding that the contrastive loss outperforms a popular alternative based on cross-view prediction, and that the more views we learn from, the better the resulting representation captures underlying scene semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on image and video unsupervised learning benchmarks.

Most of the existing algorithms are graph-based ones to learn the complex structures within multiview data but overlooked the information within data representations. Furthermore, many existing works treat multiple views discriminatively by introducing some hyperparameters, which is undesirable in practice. To this end, abundant multiview based methods have been proposed for dimension reduction. However, there are still no research to leverage the existing work into a unified framework. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a general framework for multiview data dimension reduction, named Kernelized Multiview Subspace Analysis (KMSA). It directly handles the multi-view feature representation in the kernel space, which provides a feasible channel for direct manipulations on multiview data with different dimensions. Meanwhile, compared with those graph-based methods, KMSA can fully exploit information from multiview data with nothing to lose. Furthermore, since different views have different influences on KMSA, we propose a self-weighted strategy to treat different views discriminatively according to their contributions. A co-regularized term is proposed to promote the mutual learning from multi-views. KMSA combines self-weighted learning with the co-regularized term to learn appropriate weights for all views. We also discuss the influence of the parameters in KMSA regarding the weights of multi-views. We evaluate our proposed framework on 6 multiview datasets for classification and image retrieval. The experimental results validate the advantages of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appearing at IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> | None |

Previous studies have shown that online peer support has limited effectiveness without expert intervention. Therefore, a system capable of assessing the severity of health state from the patients' social media posts can help health professionals (HP) in prioritizing the user's post. In this study, we inspect the efficacy of different aspects of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to identify the severity of the user's health state in relation to two perspectives(tasks) (a) Medical Condition (i.e., Recover, Exist, Deteriorate, Other) and (b) Medication (i.e., Effective, Ineffective, Serious Adverse Effect, Other) in online health communities. We propose a multiview learning framework that models both the textual content as well as contextual-information to assess the severity of the user's health state. Specifically, our model utilizes the NLU views such as sentiment, emotions, personality, and use of figurative language to extract the contextual information. The diverse NLU views demonstrate its effectiveness on both the tasks and as well as on the individual disease to assess a user's health.</p></details> |  | None |

It aims to quantify the morphological indices of the coronary artery lesions such as minimum lumen diameter, reference vessel diameter, lesion length, and these indices are the reference of the interventional stent placement. In this study, we propose a direct multiview quantitative coronary angiography (DMQCA) model as an automatic clinical tool to quantify the coronary artery stenosis from X-ray coronary angiography images. The proposed DMQCA model consists of a multiview module with two attention mechanisms, a key-frame module, and a regression module, to achieve direct accurate multiple-index estimation. The multi-view module comprehensively learns the Spatio-temporal features of coronary arteries through a three-dimensional convolution. The attention mechanisms of each view focus on the subtle feature of the lesion region and capture the important context information. The key-frame module learns the subtle features of the stenosis through successive dilated residual blocks. The regression module finally generates the indices estimation from multiple features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Refin...</summary><p>Refine some text in paper</p></details> | None |

Our contribution is threefold: First, we propose an outlier rejection scheme using two-view RANSAC with the midpoint method. By prescreening the two-view samples prior to triangulation, we achieve the state-of-the-art efficiency. Second, we compare different local optimization methods for refining the initial solution and the inlier set. With an iterative update of the inlier set, we show that the optimization provides significant improvement in accuracy and robustness. Third, we model the uncertainty of a triangulated point as a function of three factors: the number of cameras, the mean reprojection error and the maximum parallax angle. Learning this model allows us to quickly interpolate the uncertainty at test time. We validate our method through an extensive evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tracking Emerges by Looking Around Static Scenes, with Neural 3D Mapping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01295v1)** | 2020-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We hypothesize that an agent that can look around in static scenes can learn rich visual representations applicable to 3D object tracking in complex dynamic scenes. We are motivated in this pursuit by the fact that the physical world itself is mostly static, and multiview correspondence labels are relatively cheap to collect in static scenes, e.g., by triangulation. We propose to leverage multiview data of \textit{static points} in arbitrary scenes (static or dynamic), to learn a neural 3D mapping module which produces features that are correspondable across time. The neural 3D mapper consumes RGB-D data as input, and produces a 3D voxel grid of deep features as output. We train the voxel features to be correspondable across viewpoints, using a contrastive loss, and correspondability across time emerges automatically. At test time, given an RGB-D video with approximate camera poses, and given the 3D box of an object to track, we track the target object by generating a map of each timestep and locating the object's features within each map. In contrast to models that represent video streams in 2D or 2.5D, our model's 3D scene representation is disentangled from projection artifacts, is stable under camera motion, and is robust to partial occlusions. We test the proposed architectures in challenging simulated and real data, and show that our unsupervised 3D object trackers outperform prior unsupervised 2D and 2.5D trackers, and approach the accuracy of supervised trackers. This work demonstrates that 3D object trackers can emerge without tracking labels, through multiview self-supervision on static data.</p></details> |  | None |

Most deep learning methods focus on improving performance by adding more network components. We propose, however, to better utilize auxiliary mechanisms, including hierarchical classification, network pruning, and skeleton-based preprocessing, to boost the model robustness and performance. We test the effectiveness of our method on four commonly used testing datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Northwestern-UCLA Multiview Action 3D, and UTD Multimodal Human Action Dataset. Our experiments show that our method can achieve either comparable or better performance on all four datasets. In particular, our method sets up a new baseline for NTU 120, the largest dataset among the four. We also analyze our method with extensive comparisons and ablation studies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Calibration Supported Robust Projective Structure-from-Motion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02045v1)** | 2020-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines rely on finding correspondences across images, recovering the projective structure of the observed scene and upgrading it to a metric frame using camera self-calibration constraints. Solving each problem is mainly carried out independently from the others. For instance, camera self-calibration generally assumes correct matches and a good projective reconstruction have been obtained. In this paper, we propose a unified SfM method, in which the matching process is supported by self-calibration constraints. We use the idea that good matches should yield a valid calibration. In this process, we make use of the Dual Image of Absolute Quadric projection equations within a multiview correspondence framework, in order to obtain robust matching from a set of putative correspondences. The matching process classifies points as inliers or outliers, which is learned in an unsupervised manner using a deep neural network. Together with theoretical reasoning why the self-calibration constraints are necessary, we show experimental results demonstrating robust multiview matching and accurate camera calibration by exploiting these constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Active Ensemble Deep Learning for Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15771v1)** | 2020-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep learning has achieved great success in image classification tasks, its performance is subject to the quantity and quality of training samples. For classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images, it is nearly impossible to annotate the images from visual interpretation. Therefore, it is urgent for remote sensing scientists to develop new techniques for PolSAR image classification under the condition of very few training samples. In this letter, we take the advantage of active learning and propose active ensemble deep learning (AEDL) for PolSAR image classification. We first show that only 35\% of the predicted labels of a deep learning model's snapshots near its convergence were exactly the same. The disagreement between snapshots is non-negligible. From the perspective of multiview learning, the snapshots together serve as a good committee to evaluate the importance of unlabeled instances. Using the snapshots committee to give out the informativeness of unlabeled data, the proposed AEDL achieved better performance on two real PolSAR images compared with standard active learning strategies. It achieved the same classification accuracy with only 86% and 55% of the training samples compared with breaking ties active learning and random selection for the Flevoland dataset.</p></details> | Accepted by GRSL | None |
| **[Nonlinear Multiview Analysis: Identifiability and Neural Network-assisted Implementation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09177v2)** | 2020-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview analysis aims at extracting shared latent components from data samples that are acquired in different domains, e.g., image, text, and audio. Classic multiview analysis, e.g., canonical correlation analysis (CCA), tackles this problem via matching the linearly transformed views in a certain latent domain. More recently, powerful nonlinear learning tools such as kernel methods and neural networks are utilized for enhancing the classic CCA. However, unlike linear CCA whose theoretical aspects are clearly understood, nonlinear CCA approaches are largely intuition-driven. In particular, it is unclear under what conditions the shared latent components across the views can be identified---while identifiability plays an essential role in many applications. In this work, we revisit nonlinear multiview analysis and address both the theoretical and computational aspects. Our work leverages a useful nonlinear model, namely, the post-nonlinear model, from the nonlinear mixture separation literature. Combining with multiview data, we take a nonlinear multiview mixture learning viewpoint, which is a natural extension of the classic generative models for linear CCA. From there, we derive a learning criterion. We show that minimizing this criterion leads to identification of the latent shared components up to certain ambiguities, under reasonable conditions. Our derivation and formulation also offer new insights and interpretations to existing deep neural network-based CCA formulations. On the computation side, we propose an effective algorithm with simple and scalable update rules. A series of simulations and real-data experiments corroborate our theoretical analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted version; IEEE transactions on signal processing</p></details> | None |

For example, robustness to adversarial perturbations, and correlations between multiple modalities. However, most regularizers are specified in terms of hidden layer outputs, which are not themselves optimization variables. In contrast to prevalent methods that optimize them indirectly through model weights, we propose inserting proximal mapping as a new layer to the deep network, which directly and explicitly produces well regularized hidden layer outputs. The resulting technique is shown well connected to kernel warping and dropout, and novel algorithms were developed for robust temporal learning and multiview modeling, both outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[MVIN: Learning Multiview Items for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12516v1)** | 2020-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have begun to utilize heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs) as auxiliary information in recommendation systems to mitigate the cold start and sparsity issues. However, utilizing a graph neural network (GNN) to capture information in KG and further apply in RS is still problematic as it is unable to see each item's properties from multiple perspectives. To address these issues, we propose the multi-view item network (MVIN), a GNN-based recommendation model which provides superior recommendations by describing items from a unique mixed view from user and entity angles. MVIN learns item representations from both the user view and the entity view. From the user view, user-oriented modules score and aggregate features to make recommendations from a personalized perspective constructed according to KG entities which incorporates user click information. From the entity view, the mixing layer contrasts layer-wise GCN information to further obtain comprehensive features from internal entity-entity interactions in the KG. We evaluate MVIN on three real-world datasets: MovieLens-1M (ML-1M), LFM-1b 2015 (LFM-1b), and Amazon-Book (AZ-book). Results show that MVIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on these three datasets. In addition, from user-view cases, we find that MVIN indeed captures entities that attract users. Figures further illustrate that mixing layers in a heterogeneous KG plays a vital role in neighborhood information aggregation.</p></details> |  | None |

The goal of HUMBI is to facilitate modeling view-specific appearance and geometry of gaze, face, hand, body, and garment from assorted people. 107 synchronized HD cameras are used to capture 772 distinctive subjects across gender, ethnicity, age, and physical condition. With the multiview image streams, we reconstruct high fidelity body expressions using 3D mesh models, which allows representing view-specific appearance using their canonical atlas. We demonstrate that HUMBI is highly effective in learning and reconstructing a complete human model and is complementary to the existing datasets of human body expressions with limited views and subjects such as MPII-Gaze, Multi-PIE, Human3.6M, and Panoptic Studio datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning multiview 3D point cloud registration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05119v2)** | 2020-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel, end-to-end learnable, multiview 3D point cloud registration algorithm. Registration of multiple scans typically follows a two-stage pipeline: the initial pairwise alignment and the globally consistent refinement. The former is often ambiguous due to the low overlap of neighboring point clouds, symmetries and repetitive scene parts. Therefore, the latter global refinement aims at establishing the cyclic consistency across multiple scans and helps in resolving the ambiguous cases. In this paper we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end algorithm for joint learning of both parts of this two-stage problem. Experimental evaluation on well accepted benchmark datasets shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin, while being end-to-end trainable and computationally less costly. Moreover, we present detailed analysis and an ablation study that validate the novel components of our approach.

However, most previous works rely on supervised learning and some impractical underlying assumptions, such as the availability of all views in training and inference time. In this work, the problem of multiview self-supervised learning (MV-SSL) is investigated, where only image to object association is given. Given this setup, a novel surrogate task for self-supervised learning is proposed by pursuing "object invariant" representation. This is solved by randomly selecting an image feature of an object as object prototype, accompanied with multiview consistency regularization, which results in view invariant stochastic prototype embedding (VISPE). Experiments shows that the recognition and retrieval results using VISPE outperform that of other self-supervised learning methods on seen and unseen data. VISPE can also be applied to semi-supervised scenario and demonstrates robust performance with limited data available.

To reduce this annotation dependency, we propose Multiview-Consistent Semi Supervised Learning (MCSS) framework that utilizes similarity in pose information from unannotated, uncalibrated but synchronized multi-view videos of human motions as additional weak supervision signal to guide 3D human pose regression. Our framework applies hard-negative mining based on temporal relations in multi-view videos to arrive at a multi-view consistent pose embedding. When jointly trained with limited 3D pose annotations, our approach improves the baseline by 25% and state-of-the-art by 8.7%, whilst using substantially smaller networks. Lastly, but importantly, we demonstrate the advantages of the learned embedding and establish view-invariant pose retrieval benchmarks on two popular, publicly available multi-view human pose datasets, Human 3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  | None |

This requires a segmentation of the high intensity scar tissue and also a segmentation of the left atrium (LA) anatomy, the latter usually being derived from a separate bright-blood acquisition. Performing both segmentations automatically from a single 3D LGE CMR acquisition would eliminate the need for an additional acquisition and avoid subsequent registration issues. In this paper, we propose a joint segmentation method based on multiview two-task (MVTT) recursive attention model working directly on 3D LGE CMR images to segment the LA (and proximal pulmonary veins) and to delineate the scar on the same dataset. Using our MVTT recursive attention model, both the LA anatomy and scar can be segmented accurately (mean Dice score of 93% for the LA anatomy and 87% for the scar segmentations) and efficiently (~0.27 seconds to simultaneously segment the LA anatomy and scars directly from the 3D LGE CMR dataset with 60-68 2D slices). Compared to conventional unsupervised learning and other state-of-the-art deep learning based methods, the proposed MVTT model achieved excellent results, leading to an automatic generation of a patient-specific anatomical model combined with scar segmentation for patients in AF.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables, accepted by Future Generation Computer Systems journal</p></details> | None |

We exploit multiview geometric constraints to avoid such shortcomings. To handle the nonrigid background like a sea, we also propose a robust fusion mechanism between motion and appearance-based features. We find dense trajectories, covering every pixel in the video, and propose trajectory-based epipolar distances to distinguish between background and foreground regions. Trajectory epipolar distances are data-independent and can be readily computed given a few features' correspondences between the images. We show that by combining epipolar distances with optical flow, a powerful motion network can be learned. Enabling the network to leverage both of these features, we propose a simple mechanism, we call input-dropout. Comparing the motion-only networks, we outperform the previous state of the art on DAVIS-2016 dataset by 5.2% in the mean IoU score. By robustly fusing our motion network with an appearance network using the input-dropout mechanism, we also outperform the previous methods on DAVIS-2016, 2017 and Segtrackv2 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision(WACV-2020)</p></details> | None |

Most approaches for multiview shape reconstruction operate on sparse shape representations, or assume a fixed number of views. We present a method that can estimate dense 3D shape, and aggregate shape across multiple and varying number of input views. Given a single input view of an object instance, we propose a representation that encodes the dense shape of the visible object surface as well as the surface behind line of sight occluded by the visible surface. When multiple input views are available, the shape representation is designed to be aggregated into a single 3D shape using an inexpensive union operation. We train a 2D CNN to learn to predict this representation from a variable number of views (1 or more). We further aggregate multiview information by using permutation equivariant layers that promote order-agnostic view information exchange at the feature level. Experiments show that our approach is able to produce dense 3D reconstructions of objects that improve in quality as more views are added.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2019</p></details> | None |

This is for example the case for multilingual collections where documents are not available in all languages. Some studies tackled this problem by assuming the existence of view generation functions to approximately complete the missing views; for example Machine Translation to translate documents into the missing languages. These functions generally require an external resource to be set and their quality has a direct impact on the performance of the learned multiview classifier over the completed training set. Our proposed approach addresses this problem by jointly learning the missing views and the multiview classifier using a tripartite game with two generators and a discriminator. Each of the generators is associated to one of the views and tries to fool the discriminator by generating the other missing view conditionally on the corresponding observed view. The discriminator then tries to identify if for an observation, one of its views is completed by one of the generators or if both views are completed along with its class. Our results on a subset of Reuters RCV1/RCV2 collections show that the discriminator achieves significant classification performance; and that the generators learn the missing views with high quality without the need of any consequent external resource.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figure | None |

It naturally arises in many data analysis, machine learning, and information retrieval applications to model dependent structures among multiple data sources. For computational convenience, existing approaches usually formulate the multiview representation learning as convex optimization problems, where global optima can be obtained by certain algorithms in polynomial time. However, many pieces of evidence have corroborated that heuristic nonconvex approaches also have good empirical computational performance and convergence to the global optima, although there is a lack of theoretical justification. Such a gap between theory and practice motivates us to study a nonconvex formulation for multiview representation learning, which can be efficiently solved by a simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. We first illustrate the geometry of the nonconvex formulation; Then, we establish asymptotic global rates of convergence to the global optima by diffusion approximations.

Although supervised multiple kernel learning has been extensively studied, until recently, only a few unsupervised approaches have been proposed. In the meanwhile, adversarial learning has recently received much attention. Many works have been proposed to defend against adversarial examples. However, little is known about the effect of adversarial perturbation in the context of multiview learning, and even less in the unsupervised case. In this study, we show that adversarial features added to a view can make the existing approaches with the min-max formulation in multiple kernel clustering yield unfavorable clusters. To address this problem and inspired by recent works in adversarial learning, we propose a multiple kernel clustering method with the min-max framework that aims to be robust to such adversarial perturbation. We evaluate the robustness of our method on simulation data under different types of adversarial perturbations and show that it outperforms several compared existing methods.

In particular, we consider general subjects such as non-human species where attaining a large scale annotated dataset is challenging. While multiview geometry can be used to self-supervise the unlabeled data, integrating the geometry into learning a keypoint detector is challenging due to representation mismatch. We address this mismatch by formulating a new differentiable representation of the epipolar constraint called epipolar divergence---a generalized distance from the epipolar lines to the corresponding keypoint distribution. Epipolar divergence characterizes when two view keypoint distributions produce zero reprojection error. We design a twin network that minimizes the epipolar divergence through stereo rectification that can significantly alleviate computational complexity and sampling aliasing in training. We demonstrate that our framework can localize customized keypoints of diverse species, e.g., humans, dogs, and monkeys.</p></details> |  | None |

They can degrade driver situation awareness and negatively impact cognitive processes, severely diminishing road safety. Therefore, detecting and assessing drivers' affective states is crucial in order to help improve the driving experience, and increase safety, comfort and well-being. Recent advances in affective computing have enabled the detection of such states. This may lead to empathic automotive user interfaces that account for the driver's emotional state and influence the driver in order to improve safety. In this work, we propose a multiview multi-task machine learning method for the detection of driver's affective states using physiological signals. The proposed approach is able to account for inter-drive variability in physiological responses while enabling interpretability of the learned models, a factor that is especially important in systems deployed in the real world. We evaluate the models on three different datasets containing real-world driving experiences.

Recent methods address this problem through deep learning, which can utilize semantic cues to deal with challenges such as textureless and reflective regions. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network called DPSNet (Deep Plane Sweep Network) whose design is inspired by best practices of traditional geometry-based approaches for dense depth reconstruction. Rather than directly estimating depth and/or optical flow correspondence from image pairs as done in many previous deep learning methods, DPSNet takes a plane sweep approach that involves building a cost volume from deep features using the plane sweep algorithm, regularizing the cost volume via a context-aware cost aggregation, and regressing the dense depth map from the cost volume. The cost volume is constructed using a differentiable warping process that allows for end-to-end training of the network. Through the effective incorporation of conventional multiview stereo concepts within a deep learning framework, DPSNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction results on a variety of challenging datasets.</p></details> | ICLR2019 accepted | None |
| **[Multiview Hessian Regularization for Image Annotation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10100v1)** | 2019-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of computer hardware and Internet technology makes large scale data dependent models computationally tractable, and opens a bright avenue for annotating images through innovative machine learning algorithms. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has consequently received intensive attention in recent years and has been successfully deployed in image annotation. One representative work in SSL is Laplacian regularization (LR), which smoothes the conditional distribution for classification along the manifold encoded in the graph Laplacian, however, it has been observed that LR biases the classification function towards a constant function which possibly results in poor generalization. In addition, LR is developed to handle uniformly distributed data (or single view data), although instances or objects, such as images and videos, are usually represented by multiview features, such as color, shape and texture. In this paper, we present multiview Hessian regularization (mHR) to address the above two problems in LR-based image annotation. In particular, mHR optimally combines multiple Hessian regularizations, each of which is obtained from a particular view of instances, and steers the classification function which varies linearly along the data manifold. We apply mHR to kernel least squares and support vector machines as two examples for image annotation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC'07 dataset validate the effectiveness of mHR by comparing it with baseline algorithms, including LR and HR.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiview Supervision By Registration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11251v2)** | 2019-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework to train a keypoint detector using multiview image streams given the limited labeled data (typically $<$4\%). We leverage the complementary relationship between multiview geometry and visual tracking to provide three types of supervisionary signals to utilize the unlabeled data: (1) keypoint detection in one view can be supervised by other views via the epipolar geometry; (2) a keypoint moves smoothly over time where its optical flow can be used to temporally supervise consecutive image frames to each other; (3) visible keypoint in one view is likely to be visible in the adjacent view. We integrate these three signals in a differentiable fashion to design a new end-to-end neural network composed of three pathways. This design allows us to extensively use the unlabeled data to train the keypoint detector. We show that our approach outperforms existing detectors including DeepLabCut tailored to the keypoint detection of non-human species such as monkeys, dogs, and mice.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Weighted Multiview Metric Learning by Maximizing the Cross Correlations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07812v1)** | 2019-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of multimedia time, one sample can always be described from multiple views which contain compatible and complementary information. Most algorithms cannot take information from multiple views into considerations and fail to achieve desirable performance in most situations. For many applications, such as image retrieval, face recognition, etc., an appropriate distance metric can better reflect the similarities between various samples. Therefore, how to construct a good distance metric learning methods which can deal with multiview data has been an important topic during the last decade. In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm named Self-weighted Multiview Metric Learning (SM2L) which can finish this task by maximizing the cross correlations between different views. Furthermore, because multiple views have different contributions to the learning procedure of SM2L, we adopt a self-weighted learning framework to assign multiple views with different weights. Various experiments on benchmark datasets can verify the performance of our proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neural Scene Decomposition for Multi-Person Motion Capture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05684v1)** | 2019-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning general image representations has proven key to the success of many computer vision tasks. For example, many approaches to image understanding problems rely on deep networks that were initially trained on ImageNet, mostly because the learned features are a valuable starting point to learn from limited labeled data. However, when it comes to 3D motion capture of multiple people, these features are only of limited use. In this paper, we therefore propose an approach to learning features that are useful for this purpose. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learning what we call a neural scene decomposition (NSD) that can be exploited for 3D pose estimation. NSD comprises three layers of abstraction to represent human subjects: spatial layout in terms of bounding-boxes and relative depth; a 2D shape representation in terms of an instance segmentation mask; and subject-specific appearance and 3D pose information. By exploiting self-supervision coming from multiview data, our NSD model can be trained end-to-end without any 2D or 3D supervision. In contrast to previous approaches, it works for multiple persons and full-frame images. Because it encodes 3D geometry, NSD can then be effectively leveraged to train a 3D pose estimation network from small amounts of annotated data.</p></details> | CVPR 2019 | None |
| **[Learning from Multiview Correlations in Open-Domain Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08890v2)** | 2019-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An increasing number of datasets contain multiple views, such as video, sound and automatic captions. A basic challenge in representation learning is how to leverage multiple views to learn better representations. This is further complicated by the existence of a latent alignment between views, such as between speech and its transcription, and by the multitude of choices for the learning objective. We explore an advanced, correlation-based representation learning method on a 4-way parallel, multimodal dataset, and assess the quality of the learned representations on retrieval-based tasks. We show that the proposed approach produces rich representations that capture most of the information shared across views. Our best models for speech and textual modalities achieve retrieval rates from 70.7% to 96.9% on open-domain, user-generated instructional videos. This shows it is possible to learn reliable representations across disparate, unaligned and noisy modalities, and encourages using the proposed approach on larger datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiview Cross-supervision for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01738v1)** | 2018-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework for a customized semantic segmentation task using multiview image streams. A key challenge of the customized task lies in the limited accessibility of the labeled data due to the requirement of prohibitive manual annotation effort. We hypothesize that it is possible to leverage multiview image streams that are linked through the underlying 3D geometry, which can provide an additional supervisionary signal to train a segmentation model. We formulate a new cross-supervision method using a shape belief transfer---the segmentation belief in one image is used to predict that of the other image through epipolar geometry analogous to shape-from-silhouette. The shape belief transfer provides the upper and lower bounds of the segmentation for the unlabeled data where its gap approaches asymptotically to zero as the number of the labeled views increases. We integrate this theory to design a novel network that is agnostic to camera calibration, network model, and semantic category and bypasses the intermediate process of suboptimal 3D reconstruction. We validate this network by recognizing a customized semantic category per pixel from realworld visual data including non-human species and a subject of interest in social videos where attaining large-scale annotation data is infeasible.</p></details> |  | None |

In many realistic settings however, snapshots of the environment are often taken from a single view, which only contains a partial set of the scene due to the field of view restriction of commodity cameras. 3D scene semantic understanding on partial point clouds is considered as a challenging task. In this work, we propose a processing approach for 3D point cloud data based on a multiview representation of the existing 360° point clouds. By fusing the original 360° point clouds and their corresponding 3D multiview representations as input data, a neural network is able to recognize partial point sets while improving the general performance on complete point sets, resulting in an overall increase of 31.9% and 4.3% in segmentation accuracy for partial and complete scene semantic understanding, respectively. This method can also be applied in a wider 3D recognition context such as 3D part segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems</p></details> | None |

The network takes an RGB image as input, regresses albedo and normal maps from which we compute lighting coefficients. Our network is trained using large uncontrolled image collections without ground truth. By incorporating a differentiable renderer, our network can learn from self-supervision. Since the problem is ill-posed we introduce additional supervision: 1. We learn a statistical natural illumination prior, 2. Our key insight is to perform offline multiview stereo (MVS) on images containing rich illumination variation. From the MVS pose and depth maps, we can cross project between overlapping views such that Siamese training can be used to ensure consistent estimation of photometric invariants. MVS depth also provides direct coarse supervision for normal map estimation. We believe this is the first attempt to use MVS supervision for learning inverse rendering.</p></details> |  | None |

We employ multiview learning for increasing accuracy and coverage of entity type information in KBs. We rely on two metaviews: language and representation. For language, we consider high-resource and low-resource languages from Wikipedia. For representation, we consider representations based on the context distribution of the entity (i.e., on its embedding), on the entity's name (i.e., on its surface form) and on its description in Wikipedia. The two metaviews language and representation can be freely combined: each pair of language and representation (e.g., German embedding, English description, Spanish name) is a distinct view. Our experiments on entity typing with fine-grained classes demonstrate the effectiveness of multiview learning. We release MVET, a large multiview - and, in particular, multilingual - entity typing dataset we created.

By varying the number of training examples and employing cross-modal transfer learning we study the role of initialization of existing deep architectures for 3D shape classification. Our analysis shows that multiview methods continue to offer the best generalization even without pretraining on large labeled image datasets, and even when trained on simplified inputs such as binary silhouettes. Furthermore, the performance of voxel-based 3D convolutional networks and point-based architectures can be improved via cross-modal transfer from image representations. Finally, we analyze the robustness of 3D shape classifiers to adversarial transformations and present a novel approach for generating adversarial perturbations of a 3D shape for multiview classifiers using a differentiable renderer. We find that point-based networks are more robust to point position perturbations while voxel-based and multiview networks are easily fooled with the addition of imperceptible noise to the input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Second Workshop on 3D Reconstruction Meets Semantics, ECCV 2018</p></details> | None |

We develop, Zoom, a new vector search solution that collaboratively optimizes accuracy, latency and memory based on a multiview approach. (1) A "preview" step generates a small set of good candidates, leveraging compressed vectors in memory for reduced footprint and fast lookup. (2) A "fullview" step on SSDs reranks those candidates with their full-length vector, striking high accuracy. Our evaluation shows that, Zoom achieves an order of magnitude improvements on efficiency while attaining equal or higher accuracy, comparing with the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method jointly learns view-specific weighted majority vote classifiers (i.e. for each view) over a set of base voters, and a second weighted majority vote classifier over the set of these view-specific weighted majority vote classifiers. We show that the empirical risk minimization of the final majority vote given a multiview training set can be cast as the minimization of Bregman divergences. This allows us to derive a parallel-update optimization algorithm for learning our multiview model. We empirically study our algorithm with a particular focus on the impact of the training set size on the multiview learning results. The experiments show that our approach is able to overcome the lack of labeled information.</p></details> |  | None |

In co-training/multiview learning, the goal is to aggregate two views of data into a prediction for a latent label. We show how to optimally combine two views of data by reducing the problem to an optimization problem. Our work gives a unified and rigorous approach to the general setting. In forecast elicitation without verification we seek to design a mechanism that elicits high quality forecasts from agents in the setting where the mechanism does not have access to the ground truth. By assuming the agents' information is independent conditioning on the outcome, we propose mechanisms where truth-telling is a strict equilibrium for both the single-task and multi-task settings. Our multi-task mechanism additionally has the property that the truth-telling equilibrium pays better than any other strategy profile and strictly better than any other "non-permutation" strategy profile when the prior satisfies some mild conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Twitter user geolocation is a difficult and active research topic with a vast literature. Most of the proposed methods follow either a content-based or a network-based approach.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method combining the strength of both approaches. Concretely, we propose a multi-entry neural network architecture named MENET leveraging the advances in deep learning and multiview learning. The generalizability of MENET enables the integration of multiple data representations. In the context of Twitter user geolocation, we realize MENET with textual, network, and metadata features. Considering the natural distribution of Twitter users across the concerned geographical area, we subdivide the surface of the earth into multi-scale cells and train MENET with the labels of the cells.

Multi-view spectral clustering methods based on similarity matrixes or graphs are pretty popular. Generally, these algorithms learn informative graphs by directly utilizing original data. However, in the real-world applications, original data often contain noises and outliers that lead to unreliable graphs. In addition, different views may have different contributions to data clustering. In this paper, a novel Multiview Subspace Clustering method unifying Adaptive neighbours and Metric learning (MSCAM), is proposed to address the above problems. In this method, we use the subspace representations of different views to adaptively learn a consensus similarity matrix, uncovering the subspace structure and avoiding noisy nature of original data. For all views, we also learn different Mahalanobis matrixes that parameterize the squared distances and consider the contributions of different views. Further, we constrain the graph constructed by the similarity matrix to have exact c (c is the number of clusters) connected components. An iterative algorithm is developed to solve this optimization problem. Moreover, experiments on a synthetic dataset and different real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MSCAM.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

In this work, we introduce a multiview hand pose dataset in which we provide color images of hands and different kind of annotations for each, i.e the bounding box and the 2D and 3D location on the joints in the hand. Besides, we introduce a simple yet accurate deep learning architecture for real-time robust 2D hand pose estimation.</p></details> |  | None |

While methods for nonlinear two-view representation learning (Deep CCA, (Andrew et al., 2013)) and linear many-view representation learning (Generalized CCA (Horst, 1961)) exist, DGCCA is the first CCA-style multiview representation learning technique that combines the flexibility of nonlinear (deep) representation learning with the statistical power of incorporating information from many independent sources, or views. We present the DGCCA formulation as well as an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for solving it. We learn DGCCA representations on two distinct datasets for three downstream tasks: phonetic transcription from acoustic and articulatory measurements, and recommending hashtags and friends on a dataset of Twitter users. We find that DGCCA representations soundly beat existing methods at phonetic transcription and hashtag recommendation, and in general perform no worse than standard linear many-view techniques.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures | None |

Availability of high performance computing devices enables learning algorithms to search simultaneously over multiple views or feature spaces to obtain an optimum classification performance. The paper is a pioneering attempt of formulating a mathematical foundation for realizing a multiview aided collaborative boosting architecture for multiclass classification. Most of the present algorithms apply multiview learning heuristically without exploring the fundamental mathematical changes imposed on traditional boosting. Also, most of the algorithms are restricted to two class or view setting. Our proposed mathematical framework enables collaborative boosting across any finite dimensional view spaces for multiclass learning. The boosting framework is based on forward stagewise additive model which minimizes a novel exponential loss function. We show that the exponential loss function essentially captures difficulty of a training sample space instead of the traditional `1/0' loss. The new algorithm restricts a weak view from over learning and thereby preventing overfitting. The model is inspired by our earlier attempt on collaborative boosting which was devoid of mathematical justification. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge much nearer to global minimum in the exponential loss space and thus supersedes our previous algorithm. The paper also presents analytical and numerical analysis of convergence and margin bounds for multiview boosting algorithms and we show that our proposed ensemble learning manifests lower error bound and higher margin compared to our previous model. Also, the proposed model is compared with traditional boosting and recent multiview boosting algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is currently under "Minor Revision" at IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems</p></details> | None |

Existing visual recognition systems are typically modeled differently for each fact type such as objects, actions, and interactions. We propose a setting where all these facts can be modeled simultaneously with a capacity to understand unbounded number of facts in a structured way. The training data comes as structured facts in images, including (1) objects (e.g., $$), (2) attributes (e.g., $$), (3) actions (e.g., $$), and (4) interactions (e.g., $$). Each fact has a semantic language view (e.g., $$) and a visual view (an image with this fact). We show that learning visual facts in a structured way enables not only a uniform but also generalizable visual understanding. We propose and investigate recent and strong approaches from the multiview learning literature and also introduce two learning representation models as potential baselines. We applied the investigated methods on several datasets that we augmented with structured facts and a large scale dataset of more than 202,000 facts and 814,000 images. Our experiments show the advantage of relating facts by the structure by the proposed models compared to the designed baselines on bidirectional fact retrieval.</p></details> | Jan 7 Update | None |

In this data set, each data points is presented by multiple different views. In this paper, we propose a novel method for this problem. This method is based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that each data point has an intact feature vector, and each view is obtained by a linear transformation from the intact vector. The second assumption is that the intact vectors are discriminative, and in the intact space, we have a linear classifier to separate the positive class from the negative class. We define an intact vector for each data point, and a view-conditional transformation matrix for each view, and propose to reconstruct the multiple view feature vectors by the product of the corresponding intact vectors and transformation matrices. Moreover, we also propose a linear classifier in the intact space, and learn it jointly with the intact vectors. The learning problem is modeled by a minimization problem, and the objective function is composed of a Cauchy error estimator-based view-conditional reconstruction term over all data points and views, and a classification error term measured by hinge loss over all the intact vectors of all the data points. Some regularization terms are also imposed to different variables in the objective function. The minimization problem is solve by an iterative algorithm using alternate optimization strategy and gradient descent algorithm. The proposed algorithm shows it advantage in the compression to other multiview learning algorithms on benchmark data sets.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, we consider multiview mixtures, spherical Gaussian mixtures, ICA, and sparse coding models. We provide tight concentration bounds for empirical moments through novel covering arguments. We analyze parameter recovery through a simple tensor power update algorithm. In the semi-supervised setting, we exploit the label or prior information to get a rough estimate of the model parameters, and then refine it using the tensor method on unlabeled samples. We establish that learning is possible when the number of components scales as $k=o(d^{p/2})$, where $d$ is the observed dimension, and $p$ is the order of the observed moment employed in the tensor method. Our concentration bound analysis also leads to minimax sample complexity for semi-supervised learning of spherical Gaussian mixtures. In the unsupervised setting, we use a simple initialization algorithm based on SVD of the tensor slices, and provide guarantees under the stricter condition that $k\le βd$ (where constant $β$ can be larger than $1$), where the tensor method recovers the components under a polynomial running time (and exponential in $β$). Our analysis establishes that a wide range of overcomplete latent variable models can be learned efficiently with low computational and sample complexity through tensor decomposition methods.</p></details> | Title changed | None |
| **[Cross-view Action Modeling, Learning and Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.2941v1)** | 2014-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods on video-based action recognition are generally view-dependent, i.e., performing recognition from the same views seen in the training data. We present a novel multiview spatio-temporal AND-OR graph (MST-AOG) representation for cross-view action recognition, i.e., the recognition is performed on the video from an unknown and unseen view. As a compositional model, MST-AOG compactly represents the hierarchical combinatorial structures of cross-view actions by explicitly modeling the geometry, appearance and motion variations. This paper proposes effective methods to learn the structure and parameters of MST-AOG. The inference based on MST-AOG enables action recognition from novel views. The training of MST-AOG takes advantage of the 3D human skeleton data obtained from Kinect cameras to avoid annotating enormous multi-view video frames, which is error-prone and time-consuming, but the recognition does not need 3D information and is based on 2D video input. A new Multiview Action3D dataset has been created and will be released. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that this new action representation significantly improves the accuracy and robustness for cross-view action recognition on 2D videos.</p></details> | CVPR 2014 | None |

Recently, manifold regularized semi-supervised learning (SSL), which explores the intrinsic data probability distribution and then improves the generalization ability with only a small number of labeled data, has emerged as a promising paradigm for semiautomatic video classification. In addition, human action videos often have multi-modal content and different representations. To tackle the above problems, in this paper we propose multiview Hessian regularized logistic regression (mHLR) for human action recognition. Compared with existing work, the advantages of mHLR lie in three folds: (1) mHLR combines multiple Hessian regularization, each of which obtained from a particular representation of instance, to leverage the exploring of local geometry; (2) mHLR naturally handle multi-view instances with multiple representations; (3) mHLR employs a smooth loss function and then can be effectively optimized. We carefully conduct extensive experiments on the unstructured social activity attribute (USAA) dataset and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multiview Hessian regularized logistic regression for human action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,2 figures, submitted to signal processing</p></details> | None |
| **[Supervised Heterogeneous Multiview Learning for Joint Association Study and Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7284v2)** | 2013-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given genetic variations and various phenotypical traits, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features, we consider two important and related tasks in biomedical research: i)to select genetic and phenotypical markers for disease diagnosis and ii) to identify associations between genetic and phenotypical data. These two tasks are tightly coupled because underlying associations between genetic variations and phenotypical features contain the biological basis for a disease. While a variety of sparse models have been applied for disease diagnosis and canonical correlation analysis and its extensions have bee widely used in association studies (e.g., eQTL analysis), these two tasks have been treated separately. To unify these two tasks, we present a new sparse Bayesian approach for joint association study and disease diagnosis. In this approach, common latent features are extracted from different data sources based on sparse projection matrices and used to predict multiple disease severity levels based on Gaussian process ordinal regression; in return, the disease status is used to guide the discovery of relationships between the data sources. The sparse projection matrices not only reveal interactions between data sources but also select groups of biomarkers related to the disease. To learn the model from data, we develop an efficient variational expectation maximization algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves higher accuracy in both predicting ordinal labels and discovering associations between data sources than alternative methods. We apply our approach to an imaging genetics dataset for the study of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Our method identifies biologically meaningful relationships between genetic variations, MRI features, and AD status, and achieves significantly higher accuracy for predicting ordinal AD stages than the competing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiview Hessian Discriminative Sparse Coding for Image Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3811v1)** | 2013-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse coding represents a signal sparsely by using an overcomplete dictionary, and obtains promising performance in practical computer vision applications, especially for signal restoration tasks such as image denoising and image inpainting. In recent years, many discriminative sparse coding algorithms have been developed for classification problems, but they cannot naturally handle visual data represented by multiview features. In addition, existing sparse coding algorithms use graph Laplacian to model the local geometry of the data distribution. It has been identified that Laplacian regularization biases the solution towards a constant function which possibly leads to poor extrapolating power. In this paper, we present multiview Hessian discriminative sparse coding (mHDSC) which seamlessly integrates Hessian regularization with discriminative sparse coding for multiview learning problems. In particular, mHDSC exploits Hessian regularization to steer the solution which varies smoothly along geodesics in the manifold, and treats the label information as an additional view of feature for incorporating the discriminative power for image annotation. We conduct extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC'07 dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of mHDSC for image annotation.</p></details> | 35 pages | None |
| **[Building MultiView Analyst Profile From Multidimensional Query Logs: From Consensual to Conflicting Preferences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.3589v1)** | 2012-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to provide suitable results to the analyst needs, user preferences summarization is widely used in several domains. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for user profile construction from OLAP query logs. The key idea is to learn the user's preferences by drawing the evidence from OLAP logs. In fact, the analyst preferences are clustered into three main pools : (i) consensual or non conflicting preferences referring to same preferences for all analysts; (ii) semi-conflicting preferences corresponding to similar preferences for some analysts; (iii) conflicting preferences related to disjoint preferences for all analysts. To build generic and global model accurately describing the analyst, we enrich the obtained characteristics through including several views, namely the personal view, the professional view and the behavioral view. After that, the multiview profile extracted from multidimensional database can be annotated.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |
