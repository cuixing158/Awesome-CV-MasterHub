| **[Joint Sensing, Communication, and Computation for Vertical Federated Edge Learning in Edge Perception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03374v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining wireless sensing and edge intelligence, edge perception networks enable intelligent data collection and processing at the network edge. However, traditional sample partition based horizontal federated edge learning struggles to effectively fuse complementary multiview information from distributed devices. To address this limitation, we propose a vertical federated edge learning (VFEEL) framework tailored for feature-partitioned sensing data. In this paper, we consider an integrated sensing, communication, and computation-enabled edge perception network, where multiple edge devices utilize wireless signals to sense environmental information for updating their local models, and the edge server aggregates feature embeddings via over-the-air computation for global model training. First, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled VFEEL in terms of the loss function degradation in the presence of wireless sensing noise and aggregation distortions during AirComp.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Egocentric Limits: Multi-View Depth-Based Learning for Robust Quadrupedal Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22744v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in legged locomotion has allowed highly dynamic and parkour-like behaviors for robots, similar to their biological counterparts. Yet, these methods mostly rely on egocentric (first-person) perception, limiting their performance, especially when the viewpoint of the robot is occluded. A promising solution would be to enhance the robot's environmental awareness by using complementary viewpoints, such as multiple actors exchanging perceptual information. Inspired by this idea, this work proposes a multi-view depth-based locomotion framework that combines egocentric and exocentric observations to provide richer environmental context during agile locomotion. Using a teacher-student distillation approach, the student policy learns to fuse proprioception with dual depth streams while remaining robust to real-world sensing imperfections. To further improve robustness, we introduce extensive domain randomization, including stochastic remote-camera dropouts and 3D positional perturbations that emulate aerial-ground cooperative sensing. Simulation results show that multi-viewpoints policies outperform single-viewpoint baseline in gap crossing, step descent, and other dynamic maneuvers, while maintaining stability when the exocentric camera is partially or completely unavailable. Additional experiments show that moderate viewpoint misalignment is well tolerated when incorporated during training. This study demonstrates that heterogeneous visual feedback improves robustness and agility in quadrupedal locomotion. Furthermore, to support reproducibility, the implementation accompanying this work is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/multiview-parkour-6FB8</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, code available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/multiview-parkour-6FB8</p></details> | None |
| **[Structure is Supervision: Multiview Masked Autoencoders for Radiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22294v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building robust medical machine learning systems requires pretraining strategies that exploit the intrinsic structure present in clinical data. We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ORV: 4D Occupancy-centric Robot Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03079v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent embodied intelligence suffers from data scarcity, while conventional simulators lack visual realism. Controllable video generation is emerging as a promising data engine, yet current action-conditioned methods still fall short: generated videos are limited in fidelity and temporal consistency, poorly aligned with controls, and often constrained to singleview settings. We attribute these issues to the representational gap between sparse control inputs and dense pixel outputs. Thus, we introduce ORV, a 4D occupancy-centric framework for robot video generation that couples action priors with occupancy-derived visual priors. Concretely, we align chunked 7-DoF actions with video latents via an Action-Expert AdaLN modulation, and inject 2D renderings of 4D semantic occupancy into the generation process as soft guidance. Meanwhile, a central obstacle is the lack of occupancy data for embodied scenarios; we therefore curate ORV-Data, a large-scale, high-quality 4D semantic occupancy dataset of robot manipulation. Across BridgeV2, DROID, and RT-1, ORV improves video generation quality and controllability, achieving 18.8% lower FVD than state of the art, +3.5% success rate on visual planning, and +6.4% success rate on policy learning. Beyond singleview generation, ORV natively supports multiview consistent synthesis and enables simulation-to-real transfer despite significant domain gaps.

| **[PALM: A Dataset and Baseline for Learning Multi-subject Hand Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05403v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from 263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone, age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CosmoBench: A Multiscale, Multiview, Multitask Cosmology Benchmark for Geometric Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03707v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training time. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at https://cosmobench.streamlit.app</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Localisation of Regularised and Multiview Support Vector Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05655v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove a few representer theorems for a localised version of the regularised and multiview support vector machine learning problem introduced by H.Q. Minh, L. Bazzani, and V. Murino, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17(2016) 1-72, that involves operator valued positive semidefinite kernels and their reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The results concern general cases when convex or nonconvex loss functions and finite or infinite dimensional input spaces are considered. We show that the general framework allows infinite dimensional input spaces and nonconvex loss functions for some special cases, in particular in case the loss functions are Gateaux differentiable. Detailed calculations are provided for the exponential least squares loss functions that lead to systems of partially nonlinear equations for which a particular different types of Newton's approximation methods based on the interior point method can be used. Some numerical experiments are performed on a toy model that illustrate the tractability of the methods that we propose.</p></details> | 39 pages | None |

This paper introduces the Augmentation-driven Multiview Audio Transformer (AMAuT), a training-from-scratch framework that eliminates the dependency on pre-trained weights while supporting arbitrary sample rates and audio lengths. AMAuT integrates four key components: (1) augmentation-driven multiview learning for robustness, (2) a conv1 + conv7 + conv1 one-dimensional CNN bottleneck for stable temporal encoding, (3) dual CLS + TAL tokens for bidirectional context representation, and (4) test-time adaptation/augmentation (TTA^2) to improve inference reliability. Experiments on five public benchmarks, AudioMNIST, SpeechCommands V1 & V2, VocalSound, and CochlScene, show that AMAuT achieves accuracies up to 99.8% while consuming less than 3% of the GPU hours required by comparable pre-trained models. Thus, AMAuT presents a highly efficient and flexible alternative to large pre-trained models, making state-of-the-art audio classification accessible in computationally constrained settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FLEX: A Largescale Multimodal, Multiview Dataset for Learning Structured Representations for Fitness Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03198v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action Quality Assessment (AQA) -- the task of quantifying how well an action is performed -- has great potential for detecting errors in gym weight training, where accurate feedback is critical to prevent injuries and maximize gains. Existing AQA datasets, however, are limited to single-view competitive sports and RGB video, lacking multimodal signals and professional assessment of fitness actions. We introduce FLEX, the first large-scale, multimodal, multiview dataset for fitness AQA that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG). FLEX contains over 7,500 multiview recordings of 20 weight-loaded exercises performed by 38 subjects of diverse skill levels, with synchronized RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological signals. Expert annotations are organized into a Fitness Knowledge Graph (FKG) linking actions, key steps, error types, and feedback, supporting a compositional scoring function for interpretable quality assessment. FLEX enables multimodal fusion, cross-modal prediction -- including the novel Video$\rightarrow$EMG task -- and biomechanically oriented representation learning. Building on the FKG, we further introduce FLEX-VideoQA, a structured question-answering benchmark with hierarchical queries that drive cross-modal reasoning in vision-language models. Baseline experiments demonstrate that multimodal inputs, multiview video, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance AQA performance. FLEX thus advances AQA toward richer multimodal settings and provides a foundation for AI-powered fitness assessment and coaching.

Comprising 27,816 indoor layouts across 18 prevalent room types and a library of 29,215 high-fidelity 3D object assets, IL3D is enriched with instance-level natural language annotations to support robust multimodal learning for vision-language tasks. We establish rigorous benchmarks to evaluate LLM-driven scene generation. Experimental results show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs on IL3D significantly improves generalization and surpasses the performance of SFT on other datasets. IL3D offers flexible multimodal data export capabilities, including point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, multiview images, depth maps, normal maps, and semantic masks, enabling seamless adaptation to various visual tasks. As a versatile and robust resource, IL3D significantly advances research in 3D scene generation and embodied intelligence, by providing high-fidelity scene data to support environment perception tasks of embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main paper; 15 pages references and appendix</p></details> | None |
| **[Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11171v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them. However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture. Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has 14 pages and 7 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Seeing the Bigger Picture: 3D Latent Mapping for Mobile Manipulation Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03885v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that mobile manipulation policies utilizing a 3D latent map achieve stronger spatial and temporal reasoning than policies relying solely on images. We introduce Seeing the Bigger Picture (SBP), an end-to-end policy learning approach that operates directly on a 3D map of latent features. In SBP, the map extends perception beyond the robot's current field of view and aggregates observations over long horizons. Our mapping approach incrementally fuses multiview observations into a grid of scene-specific latent features. A pre-trained, scene-agnostic decoder reconstructs target embeddings from these features and enables online optimization of the map features during task execution. A policy, trainable with behavior cloning or reinforcement learning, treats the latent map as a state variable and uses global context from the map obtained via a 3D feature aggregator. We evaluate SBP on scene-level mobile manipulation and sequential tabletop manipulation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that SBP (i) reasons globally over the scene, (ii) leverages the map as long-horizon memory, and (iii) outperforms image-based policies in both in-distribution and novel scenes, e.g., improving the success rate by 25% for the sequential manipulation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://existentialrobotics.org/sbp_page/</p></details> | None |

This framework enables users to define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image, seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning, ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.</p></details> | version 1 | None |
| **[Alignment Unlocks Complementarity: A Framework for Multiview Circuit Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20968v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich, complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Fused State Representations for Control from Multi-View Observations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01316v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Reinforcement Learning (MVRL) seeks to provide agents with multi-view observations, enabling them to perceive environment with greater effectiveness and precision. Recent advancements in MVRL focus on extracting latent representations from multiview observations and leveraging them in control tasks. However, it is not straightforward to learn compact and task-relevant representations, particularly in the presence of redundancy, distracting information, or missing views. In this paper, we propose Multi-view Fusion State for Control (MFSC), firstly incorporating bisimulation metric learning into MVRL to learn task-relevant representations. Furthermore, we propose a multiview-based mask and latent reconstruction auxiliary task that exploits shared information across views and improves MFSC's robustness in missing views by introducing a mask token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in MVRL tasks. Even in more realistic scenarios with interference or missing views, MFSC consistently maintains high performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ConfidentSplat: Confidence-Weighted Depth Fusion for Accurate 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16863v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ConfidentSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based SLAM system for robust, highfidelity RGB-only reconstruction. Addressing geometric inaccuracies in existing RGB-only 3DGS SLAM methods that stem from unreliable depth estimation, ConfidentSplat incorporates a core innovation: a confidence-weighted fusion mechanism. This mechanism adaptively integrates depth cues from multiview geometry with learned monocular priors (Omnidata ViT), dynamically weighting their contributions based on explicit reliability estimates-derived predominantly from multi-view geometric consistency-to generate high-fidelity proxy depth for map supervision. The resulting proxy depth guides the optimization of a deformable 3DGS map, which efficiently adapts online to maintain global consistency following pose updates from a DROID-SLAM-inspired frontend and backend optimizations (loop closure, global bundle adjustment). Extensive validation on standard benchmarks (TUM-RGBD, ScanNet) and diverse custom mobile datasets demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy (L1 depth error) and novel view synthesis fidelity (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) over baselines, particularly in challenging conditions. ConfidentSplat underscores the efficacy of principled, confidence-aware sensor fusion for advancing state-of-the-art dense visual SLAM.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Averages: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding with Gaussian Splatting and Bag of Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12938v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics. While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation, creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects. This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.</p></details> |  | None |

We study design choices that most affect stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning policies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Multi-population Ensemble Genetic Programming via Cooperative Coevolution and Multi-view Learning for Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19339v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Multi-population Ensemble Genetic Programming (MEGP), a computational intelligence framework that integrates cooperative coevolution and the multiview learning paradigm to address classification challenges in high-dimensional and heterogeneous feature spaces. MEGP decomposes the input space into conditionally independent feature subsets, enabling multiple subpopulations to evolve in parallel while interacting through a dynamic ensemble-based fitness mechanism. Each individual encodes multiple genes whose outputs are aggregated via a differentiable softmax-based weighting layer, enhancing both model interpretability and adaptive decision fusion. A hybrid selection mechanism incorporating both isolated and ensemble-level fitness promotes inter-population cooperation while preserving intra-population diversity. This dual-level evolutionary dynamic facilitates structured search exploration and reduces premature convergence. Experimental evaluations across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGP consistently outperforms a baseline GP model in terms of convergence behavior and generalization performance. Comprehensive statistical analyses validate significant improvements in Log-Loss, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC. MEGP also exhibits robust diversity retention and accelerated fitness gains throughout evolution, highlighting its effectiveness for scalable, ensemble-driven evolutionary learning. By unifying population-based optimization, multi-view representation learning, and cooperative coevolution, MEGP contributes a structurally adaptive and interpretable framework that advances emerging directions in evolutionary machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>59 Pa...</summary><p>59 Pages, 68 Figures, 27 Tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Maximally Useful and Minimally Redundant: The Key to Self Supervised Learning for Imbalanced Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08469v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view} assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive) also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\% improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LMVC: An End-to-End Learned Multiview Video Coding Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03922v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive 3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding (LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research in this field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Variational Multivariate Information Bottleneck -- A Framework for Variational Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03311v4)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational dimensionality reduction methods are widely used for their accuracy, generative capabilities, and robustness. We introduce a unifying framework that generalizes both such as traditional and state-of-the-art methods. The framework is based on an interpretation of the multivariate information bottleneck, trading off the information preserved in an encoder graph (defining what to compress) against that in a decoder graph (defining a generative model for data). Using this approach, we rederive existing methods, including the deep variational information bottleneck, variational autoencoders, and deep multiview information bottleneck. We naturally extend the deep variational CCA (DVCCA) family to beta-DVCCA and introduce a new method, the deep variational symmetric information bottleneck (DVSIB). DSIB, the deterministic limit of DVSIB, connects to modern contrastive learning approaches such as Barlow Twins, among others. We evaluate these methods on Noisy MNIST and Noisy CIFAR-100, showing that algorithms better matched to the structure of the problem like DVSIB and beta-DVCCA produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy, dimensionality of the latent variables, sample efficiency, and consistently outperform other approaches under comparable conditions. Additionally, we benchmark against state-of-the-art models, achieving superior or competitive accuracy. Our results demonstrate that this framework can seamlessly incorporate diverse multi-view representation learning algorithms, providing a foundation for designing novel, problem-specific loss functions.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU), which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations. Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures,conference</p></details> | None |
| **[A Joint Sparse Self-Representation Learning Method for Multiview Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06857v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view, cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability. To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 6 pages | None |

The practical scenarios where unpaired multiview data with missing values have wide applications in generative learning, cross-modal retrieval, and wireless device identification problems. Following the perspective that the shared information between the incomplete multiview data aligns with the cluster targets, recent works have generalized the well-known common information frameworks in information theory multiview learning problems, with improved performance reported. Different from previous works, we extend the frameworks to incomplete multiview clustering problems and propose an efficient solver: Wyner Incomplete MultiView Clustering (WyIMVC). Interestingly, the common randomness in WyIMVC allows for joint clustering and missing value inference in contrast to the compared methods in the literature. Moreover, leveraging the difference-of-convex structure of the formulated problems, we propose an efficient solver with a convergence guarantee independent of initialization. Empirically, our solver outperforms the state-of-the-art solvers in a range of incomplete multiview datasets with varying numbers of views and dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, ITW2025</p></details> | None |

However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets. Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM), which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over benchmark datasets.

Its success is crucial for advancing applications in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion, Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions, and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks, including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset, demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework. Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.</p></details> |  | None |

With the focus of scalable self-supervised learning of LSD, we revisit and streamline the fundamental designs of (deep and non-deep) LSD approaches to have a high-performing and efficient LSD learner, dubbed as ScaleLSD, for the curation of line geometry at scale from over 10M unlabeled real-world images. Our ScaleLSD works very well to detect much more number of line segments from any natural images even than the pioneered non-deep LSD approach, having a more complete and accurate geometric characterization of images using line segments. Experimentally, our proposed ScaleLSD is comprehensively testified under zero-shot protocols in detection performance, single-view 3D geometry estimation, two-view line segment matching, and multiview 3D line mapping, all with excellent performance obtained. Based on the thorough evaluation, our ScaleLSD is observed to be the first deep approach that outperforms the pioneered non-deep LSD in all aspects we have tested, significantly expanding and reinforcing the versatility of the line geometry of images.

However, conventional cross-modal contrastive learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment also promotes better vision and language understanding.

Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure. To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing. Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.</p></details> |  | None |

SMILE-VLM learns robust, semantically aligned, and view-invariant embeddings by proposing three core components: multiview decorrelation via a Barlow Twins-style loss, vision-language contrastive alignment, and cross-modal redundancy minimization. Our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. We further extend SMILE-VLM to the task of 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) to recognize the subtle affective cues. The extensive results demonstrate that SMILE-VLM not only surpasses existing unsupervised methods but also matches or exceeds supervised baselines, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution for expressive facial behavior understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

To bridge the gap between automated and autonomous operation, a computer vision-based system is proposed, integrating deep learning and multiview cameras for real-time collision detection. The system utilizes equipment segmentation, tracking, and geometric analysis to assess potential collisions with transfer learning that enhances robustness. In addition, an interactive annotation module has been developed to improve the adaptability to new object classes. Experiments on a real beamline dataset demonstrate high accuracy, real-time performance, and strong potential for autonomous synchrotron beamline operations.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its few-step efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenging task, MoDGS adopts recent single-view depth estimation methods to guide the learning of the dynamic scene. Then, a novel 3D-aware initialization method is proposed to learn a reasonable deformation field and a new robust depth loss is proposed to guide the learning of dynamic scene geometry. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MoDGS is able to render high-quality novel view images of dynamic scenes from just a casually captured monocular video, which outperforms state-of-the-art meth ods by a significant margin.

We propose a method that improves the performance of deep learning-based monocular 3D human pose estimation models by using multiview data only during training, but not during inference. We introduce a novel loss function, consistency loss, which operates on two synchronized views. This approach is simpler than previous models that require 3D ground truth or intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Our consistency loss penalizes differences in two pose sequences after rigid alignment. We also demonstrate that our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning without requiring 3D data. Furthermore, we show that using our consistency loss can yield state-of-the-art performance when training models from scratch in a semi-supervised manner. Our findings provide a simple way to capture new data, e.g in a new domain. This data can be added using off-the-shelf cameras with no calibration requirements.

This paper concentrates on pose graph construction and motion synchronization within multiview registration. Previous methods for pose graph construction often pruned fully connected graphs or constructed sparse graph using global feature aggregated from local descriptors, which may not consistently yield reliable results. To identify dependable pairs for pose graph construction, we design a network model that extracts information from the matching distance between point cloud pairs. For motion synchronization, we propose another neural network model to calculate the absolute pose in a data-driven manner, rather than optimizing inaccurate handcrafted loss functions. Our model takes into account geometric distribution information and employs a modified attention mechanism to facilitate flexible and reliable feature interaction. Experimental results on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Traditional machine learning models remain effective in resource-limited environments due to their efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and less computational time. However, handling short and highly imbalanced datasets remains challenging. In this study, we propose the fusion of a Contrastive Attentive Graph Network and Graph Attention Network (CAGN-GAT Fusion) and benchmark it against 15 other models, including both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models. Our evaluation is conducted on four benchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a short and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000 samples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion demonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though it does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also highlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including small changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of features (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings confirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

The more we observe the object motion, the better we get at predicting its 3D state immediately. Existing systems either optimize underlying representations from multi-view observations or train a feed-forward predictor from supervised datasets. We introduce Predict-Optimize-Distill (POD), a self-improving framework that interleaves prediction and optimization in a mutually reinforcing cycle to achieve better 4D object understanding with increasing observation time. Given a multi-view object scan and a long-form monocular video of human-object interaction, POD iteratively trains a neural network to predict local part poses from RGB frames, uses this predictor to initialize a global optimization which refines output poses through inverse rendering, then finally distills the results of optimization back into the model by generating synthetic self-labeled training data from novel viewpoints. Each iteration improves both the predictive model and the optimized motion trajectory, creating a virtuous cycle that bootstraps its own training data to learn about the pose configurations of an object. We also introduce a quasi-multiview mining strategy for reducing depth ambiguity by leveraging long video. We evaluate POD on 14 real-world and 5 synthetic objects with various joint types, including revolute and prismatic joints as well as multi-body configurations where parts detach or reattach independently. POD demonstrates significant improvement over a pure optimization baseline which gets stuck in local minima, particularly for longer videos. We also find that POD's performance improves with both video length and successive iterations of the self-improving cycle, highlighting its ability to scale performance with additional observations and looped refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>See o...</summary><p>See our website at: https://predict-optimize-distill.github.io/pod.github.io First two authors contributed equally</p></details> | [Code Link](https://predict-optimize-distill.github.io/pod.github.io) |

Recent methods have adopt 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to produce 3D scenes due to its efficient training process. However, these methodologies may generate incomplete 3D scenes or blurred multiviews. This is because of (1) inaccurate 3DGS point initialization and (2) the tendency of 3DGS to flatten 3D Gaussians with the sparse-view input. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework EG-Gaussian, which utilizes epipolar geometry and graph networks for 3D scene reconstruction. Initially, we integrate epipolar geometry into the 3DGS initialization phase to enhance initial 3DGS point construction. Then, we specifically design a graph learning module to refine 3DGS spatial features, in which we incorporate both spatial coordinates and angular relationships among neighboring points. Experiments on indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to 3DGS-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike existing texture generation techniques that use ad hoc backprojection and averaging schemes to blend multiview images into textures, often resulting in texture seams and artifacts, our approach employs a trained neural module to boost texture coherency. The key ingredient of our module is to leverage neural attention and appropriate positional encodings of image pixels based on their corresponding 3D point positions, normals, and surface-aware coordinates as encoded in geodesic distances within surface patches. These encodings capture texture correlations between neighboring surface points, ensuring better texture continuity. Experimental results show that our module improves texture quality, achieving superior performance in high-resolution texture generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiview Image-Based Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23577v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The image retrieval (IR) approach to image localization has distinct advantages to the 3D and the deep learning (DNN) approaches: it is seen-agnostic, simpler to implement and use, has no privacy issues, and is computationally efficient. The main drawback of this approach is relatively poor localization in both position and orientation of the query camera when compared to the competing approaches. This paper represents a hybrid approach that stores only image features in the database like some IR methods, but relies on a latent 3D reconstruction, like 3D methods but without retaining a 3D scene reconstruction. The approach is based on two ideas: {\em (i)} a novel proposal where query camera center estimation relies only on relative translation estimates but not relative rotation estimates through a decoupling of the two, and {\em (ii)} a shift from computing optimal pose from estimated relative pose to computing optimal pose from multiview correspondences, thus cutting out the ``middle-man''. Our approach shows improved performance on the 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets while also improving on timing and memory footprint as compared to state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  | None |

Automated grading enables faster processing, precision, and reduced human labor. In this paper, we implement a deep learning-based solution for orange grading via machine vision. Unlike typical grading systems that analyze fruits from a single view, we capture multiview images of each single orange in order to enable a richer representation. Afterwards, we compose the acquired images into one collage. This enables the analysis of the whole orange skin. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the composed images to grade the oranges into three classes, namely good, bad, and undefined. We also evaluate the performance with two different CNNs (ResNet-18 and SqueezeNet). We show experimentally that multi-view grading is superior to single view grading.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional multiview geometry-based approaches often struggle with dynamic motion, whereas recent learning-based methods either require specialized 4D representation or sophisticated optimization. In this paper, we present Sora3R, a novel framework that taps into the rich spatiotemporal priors of large-scale video diffusion models to directly infer 4D pointmaps from casual videos. Sora3R follows a two-stage pipeline: (1) we adapt a pointmap VAE from a pretrained video VAE, ensuring compatibility between the geometry and video latent spaces; (2) we finetune a diffusion backbone in combined video and pointmap latent space to generate coherent 4D pointmaps for every frame. Sora3R operates in a fully feedforward manner, requiring no external modules (e.g., depth, optical flow, or segmentation) or iterative global alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sora3R reliably recovers both camera poses and detailed scene geometry, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art methods for dynamic 4D reconstruction across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This limitation stems from a lack of specialized ADL video instruction-tuning datasets and insufficient modality integration to capture discriminative action representations. To address this, we propose a semi-automated framework for curating ADL datasets, creating ADL-X, a multiview, multimodal RGBS instruction-tuning dataset. Additionally, we introduce LLAVIDAL, an LLVM integrating videos, 3D skeletons, and HOIs to model ADL's complex spatiotemporal relationships. For training LLAVIDAL a simple joint alignment of all modalities yields suboptimal results; thus, we propose a Multimodal Progressive (MMPro) training strategy, incorporating modalities in stages following a curriculum. We also establish ADL MCQ and video description benchmarks to assess LLVM performance in ADL tasks. Trained on ADL-X, LLAVIDAL achieves state-of-the-art performance across ADL benchmarks.

Through systematic evaluation, we find that while DINO and iBOT outperform MAE across visuomotor control and perception tasks, they struggle when trained on non-(single-)object-centric (NOC) data--a limitation strongly correlated with their diminished ability to learn object-centric representations. This investigation indicates that the ability to form object-centric representations from the non-object-centric robotics dataset is the key to success for PVMs. Motivated by this discovery, we designed SlotMIM, a method that induces object-centric representations by introducing a semantic bottleneck to reduce the number of prototypes to encourage the emergence of objectness as well as cross-view consistency regularization for encouraging multiview invariance. Our experiments encompass pre-training on object-centric, scene-centric, web-crawled, and ego-centric data. Across all settings, our approach learns transferrable representations and achieves significant improvements over prior work in image recognition, scene understanding, and robot learning evaluations. When scaled up with million-scale datasets, our method also demonstrates superior data efficiency and scalability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SlotMIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SlotMIM) |

Multiview lightsheet microscopy improves 3-D resolution by combining multiple views but simultaneously increasing the complexity and the photon budget, leading to potential photobleaching and phototoxicity. The FuseMyCells challenge, organized in conjunction with the IEEE ISBI 2025 conference, aims to benchmark deep learning-based solutions for fusing high-quality 3-D volumes from single 3-D views, potentially simplifying procedures and conserving the photon budget. In this work, we propose a contribution to the FuseMyCells challenge based on a two-step procedure. The first step processes a downsampled version of the image to capture the entire region of interest, while the second step uses a patch-based approach for high-resolution inference, incorporating adversarial loss to enhance visual outcomes. This method addresses challenges related to high data resolution, the necessity of global context, and the preservation of high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to improve 3-D image fusion quality and extend the capabilities of lightsheet microscopy. The average SSIM for the nucleus and membranes is greater than 0.85 and 0.91, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GAGS: Granularity-Aware Feature Distillation for Language Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13654v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D open-vocabulary scene understanding, which accurately perceives complex semantic properties of objects in space, has gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose GAGS, a framework that distills 2D CLIP features into 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling open-vocabulary queries for renderings on arbitrary viewpoints. The main challenge of distilling 2D features for 3D fields lies in the multiview inconsistency of extracted 2D features, which provides unstable supervision for the 3D feature field. GAGS addresses this challenge with two novel strategies. First, GAGS associates the prompt point density of SAM with the camera distances, which significantly improves the multiview consistency of segmentation results. Second, GAGS further decodes a granularity factor to guide the distillation process and this granularity factor can be learned in a unsupervised manner to only select the multiview consistent 2D features in the distillation process. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate significant performance and stability improvements of GAGS in visual grounding and semantic segmentation, with an inference speed 2$\times$ faster than baseline methods.

| **[Segment Any Mesh](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13679v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Segment Any Mesh, a novel zero-shot mesh part segmentation method that overcomes the limitations of shape analysis-based, learning-based, and contemporary approaches. Our approach operates in two phases: multimodal rendering and 2D-to-3D lifting. In the first phase, multiview renders of the mesh are individually processed through Segment Anything to generate 2D masks. These masks are then lifted into a mesh part segmentation by associating masks that refer to the same mesh part across the multiview renders. We find that applying Segment Anything to multimodal feature renders of normals and shape diameter scalars achieves better results than using only untextured renders of meshes. By building our method on top of Segment Anything, we seamlessly inherit any future improvements made to 2D segmentation. We compare our method with a robust, well-evaluated shape analysis method, Shape Diameter Function, and show that our method is comparable to or exceeds its performance. Since current benchmarks contain limited object diversity, we also curate and release a dataset of generated meshes and use it to demonstrate our method's improved generalization over Shape Diameter Function via human evaluation. We release the code and dataset at https://github.com/gtangg12/samesh</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/gtangg12/samesh) |

Particularly, in safety-critical domains like surgical applications, obtaining high-quality data can be especially difficult. It poses challenges to researchers seeking to exploit recent advancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning, which have greatly improved generalizability and enabled robots to conduct tasks autonomously. We introduce dARt Vinci, a scalable data collection platform for robot learning in surgical settings. The system uses Augmented Reality (AR) hand tracking and a high-fidelity physics engine to capture subtle maneuvers in primitive surgical tasks: By eliminating the need for a physical robot setup and providing flexibility in terms of time, space, and hardware resources-such as multiview sensors and actuators-specialized simulation is a viable alternative. At the same time, AR allows the robot data collection to be more egocentric, supported by its body tracking and content overlaying capabilities. Our user study confirms the proposed system's efficiency and usability, where we use widely-used primitive tasks for training teleoperation with da Vinci surgical robots. Data throughput improves across all tasks compared to real robot settings by 41% on average. The total experiment time is reduced by an average of 10%. The temporal demand in the task load survey is improved. These gains are statistically significant. Additionally, the collected data is over 400 times smaller in size, requiring far less storage while achieving double the frequency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

Most IMVC approaches tackle this problem by either learning consensus representations from available views or reconstructing missing samples using the underlying manifold structure. However, the reconstruction of learned similarity graph tensor in prior studies only exploits the low-tubal-rank information, neglecting the exploration of inter-view correlations. This paper propose a novel joint tensor and inter-view low-rank Recovery (JTIV-LRR), framing IMVC as a joint optimization problem that integrates incomplete similarity graph learning and tensor representation recovery. By leveraging both intra-view and inter-view low rank information, the method achieves robust estimation of the complete similarity graph tensor through sparse noise removal and low-tubal-rank constraints along different modes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, achieving significant improvements in clustering accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under review at IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</p></details> | None |

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention for its high-quality rendering and fast inference speed. Yet, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, ensuring accurate geometry reconstruction remains difficult. Existing methods primarily focus on geometry regularization, with common approaches including primitive-based and dual-model frameworks. However, the former suffers from inherent conflicts between rendering and reconstruction, while the latter is computationally and storage-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose CarGS, a unified model leveraging Contribution-adaptive regularization to achieve simultaneous, high-quality rendering and surface reconstruction. The essence of our framework is learning adaptive contribution for Gaussian primitives by squeezing the knowledge from geometry regularization into a compact MLP. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-guided densification strategy with clues from both normals and Signed Distance Fields (SDF) to improve the capability of capturing high-frequency details. Our design improves the mutual learning of the two tasks, meanwhile its unified structure does not require separate models as in dual-model based approaches, guaranteeing efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the ability to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both rendering fidelity and reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time speed and minimal storage size.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a significant challenge persists in single-criteria recommender systems, which often overlook the diverse attributes of items that have been addressed by Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems (MCRS). Shared embedding vector for multi-criteria item ratings but have struggled to capture the nuanced relationships between users and items based on specific criteria. In this study, we present a novel representation for Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems (MCRS) based on a multi-edge bipartite graph, where each edge represents one criterion rating of items by users, and Multiview Dual Graph Attention Networks (MDGAT). Employing MDGAT is beneficial and important for adequately considering all relations between users and items, given the presence of both local (criterion-based) and global (multi-criteria) relations. Additionally, we define anchor points in each view based on similarity and employ local and global contrastive learning to distinguish between positive and negative samples across each view and the entire graph. We evaluate our method on two real-world datasets and assess its performance based on item rating predictions. The results demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy compared to the baseline method for predicting item ratings on the same datasets. MDGAT effectively capture the local and global impact of neighbours and the similarity between nodes.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods focus on pairwise registration of two point clouds with high overlap. Although there have been some methods for low overlap cases, they struggle in degraded scenarios. This paper introduces a novel framework dubbed L-PR, designed to register unordered low overlap multiview point clouds leveraging LiDAR fiducial markers. We refer to them as LiDAR fiducial markers, but they are the same as the popular AprilTag and ArUco markers, thin sheets of paper that do not affect the 3D geometry of the environment. We first propose an improved adaptive threshold marker detection method to provide robust detection results when the viewpoints among point clouds change dramatically. Then, we formulate the unordered multiview point cloud registration problem as a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem and develop a framework consisting of two levels of graphs to address it. The first-level graph, constructed as a weighted graph, is designed to efficiently and optimally infer initial values of scan poses from the unordered set. The second-level graph is constructed as a factor graph. By globally optimizing the variables on the graph, including scan poses, marker poses, and marker corner positions, we tackle the MAP problem. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and to showcase that L-PR can serve as a low-cost and efficient tool for 3D asset collection and training data collection. In particular, we collect a new dataset named Livox-3DMatch using L-PR and incorporate it into the training of the SOTA learning-based method, SGHR, which brings evident improvements for SGHR on various benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-view Video-Pose Pretraining for Operating Room Surgical Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13883v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the workflow of surgical procedures in complex operating rooms requires a deep understanding of the interactions between clinicians and their environment. Surgical activity recognition (SAR) is a key computer vision task that detects activities or phases from multi-view camera recordings. Existing SAR models often fail to account for fine-grained clinician movements and multi-view knowledge, or they require calibrated multi-view camera setups and advanced point-cloud processing to obtain better results. In this work, we propose a novel calibration-free multi-view multi-modal pretraining framework called Multiview Pretraining for Video-Pose Surgical Activity Recognition PreViPS, which aligns 2D pose and vision embeddings across camera views. Our model follows CLIP-style dual-encoder architecture: one encoder processes visual features, while the other encodes human pose embeddings. To handle the continuous 2D human pose coordinates, we introduce a tokenized discrete representation to convert the continuous 2D pose coordinates into discrete pose embeddings, thereby enabling efficient integration within the dual-encoder framework. To bridge the gap between these two modalities, we propose several pretraining objectives using cross- and in-modality geometric constraints within the embedding space and incorporating masked pose token prediction strategy to enhance representation learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate improvements over the strong baselines, while data-efficiency experiments on two distinct operating room datasets further highlight the effectiveness of our approach. We highlight the benefits of our approach for surgical activity recognition in both multi-view and single-view settings, showcasing its practical applicability in complex surgical environments.

Accurate segmentation facilitates environmental impact assessments, timely interventions, and compliance with safety standards. However, existing models often face high computational demands and limited adaptability to diverse smoke appearances, restricting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these issues, we introduce SmokeNet, a novel deep learning architecture that leverages multiscale convolutions and multiview linear attention mechanisms combined with layer-specific loss functions to handle the complex dynamics of diverse smoke plumes, ensuring efficient and accurate segmentation across varied environments. Additionally, we evaluate SmokeNet's performance and versatility using four datasets, including our quarry blast smoke dataset made available to the community. The results demonstrate that SmokeNet maintains a favorable balance between computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in environmental monitoring and safety management systems. By contributing a new dataset and offering an efficient segmentation model, SmokeNet advances smoke segmentation capabilities in diverse and challenging environments.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior validation studies show MMMC performs well on average, they do not provide what is needed in clinical practice or for large-scale utilization of MMMC -- confidence intervals over specific kinematic estimates from a specific individual analyzed using a possibly unique camera configuration. We extend our previous work using an implicit representation of trajectories optimized end-to-end through a differentiable biomechanical model to learn the posterior probability distribution over pose given all the detected keypoints. This posterior probability is learned through a variational approximation and estimates confidence intervals for individual joints at each moment in a trial, showing confidence intervals generally within 10-15 mm of spatial error for virtual marker locations, consistent with our prior validation studies. Confidence intervals over joint angles are typically only a few degrees and widen for more distal joints. The posterior also models the correlation structure over joint angles, such as correlations between hip and pelvis angles. The confidence intervals estimated through this method allow us to identify times and trials where kinematic uncertainty is high.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, due to its shallow learning nature, RVFL often fails to consider all the relevant information available in a dataset. Additionally, it overlooks the geometrical properties of the dataset. To address these limitations, a novel graph random vector functional link based on multi-view learning (GRVFL-MV) model is proposed. The proposed model is trained on multiple views, incorporating the concept of multiview learning (MVL), and it also incorporates the geometrical properties of all the views using the graph embedding (GE) framework. The fusion of RVFL networks, MVL, and GE framework enables our proposed model to achieve the following: i) efficient learning: by leveraging the topology of RVFL, our proposed model can efficiently capture nonlinear relationships within the multi-view data, facilitating efficient and accurate predictions; ii) comprehensive representation: fusing information from diverse perspectives enhance the proposed model's ability to capture complex patterns and relationships within the data, thereby improving the model's overall generalization performance; and iii) structural awareness: by employing the GE framework, our proposed model leverages the original data distribution of the dataset by naturally exploiting both intrinsic and penalty subspace learning criteria. The evaluation of the proposed GRVFL-MV model on various datasets, including 27 UCI and KEEL datasets, 50 datasets from Corel5k, and 45 datasets from AwA, demonstrates its superior performance compared to baseline models.

We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities for interactive AI agents.</p></details> | 3DV 2025 | None |

Bridging this gap is vital for robotics and computer vision but challenging due to the sparse, unstructured nature of 3D LiDAR data and 2D-focused fiducial marker designs. This dissertation proposes a novel framework for mapping and localization using LFMs is proposed to benefit a variety of real-world applications, including the collection of 3D assets and training data for point cloud registration, 3D map merging, Augmented Reality (AR), and many more. First, an Intensity Image-based LiDAR Fiducial Marker (IFM) system is introduced, using thin, letter-sized markers compatible with VFMs. A detection method locates 3D fiducials from intensity images, enabling LiDAR pose estimation. Second, an enhanced algorithm extends detection to 3D maps, increasing marker range and facilitating tasks like 3D map merging. This method leverages both intensity and geometry, overcoming limitations of geometry-only detection approaches. Third, a new LFM-based mapping and localization method registers unordered, low-overlap point clouds. It employs adaptive threshold detection and a two-level graph framework to solve a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem, optimizing point cloud and marker poses.

However, most existing methods still face significant challenges in learning view-consistency features, which are crucial for effective multiview learning. Motivated by the theories of CCA and contrastive learning in multiview feature learning, we propose the hierarchical consensus network (HCN) in this paper. The HCN derives three consensus indices for capturing the hierarchical consensus across views, which are classifying consensus, coding consensus, and global consensus, respectively. Specifically, classifying consensus reinforces class-level correspondence between views from a CCA perspective, while coding consensus closely resembles contrastive learning and reflects contrastive comparison of individual instances. Global consensus aims to extract consensus information from two perspectives simultaneously. By enforcing the hierarchical consensus, the information within each view is better integrated to obtain more comprehensive and discriminative features. The extensive experimental results obtained on four multiview datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 accepted paper</p></details> | None |

While multi-view learning has undergone vigorous development and achieved remarkable success, the theoretical understanding of its generalization behavior remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this gap by developing information-theoretic generalization bounds for multi-view learning, with a particular focus on multi-view reconstruction and classification tasks. Our bounds underscore the importance of capturing both consensus and complementary information from multiple different views to achieve maximally disentangled representations. These results also indicate that applying the multi-view information bottleneck regularizer is beneficial for satisfactory generalization performance. Additionally, we derive novel data-dependent bounds under both leave-one-out and supersample settings, yielding computational tractable and tighter bounds. In the interpolating regime, we further establish the fast-rate bound for multi-view learning, exhibiting a faster convergence rate compared to conventional square-root bounds. Numerical results indicate a strong correlation between the true generalization gap and the derived bounds across various learning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Our particular focus in this article is on studying relationships between such multiview features and responses. A motivating application arises in the context of precision medicine where multi-omics data are collected to correlate with clinical outcomes. It is of interest to infer dependence within and across views while combining multimodal information to improve the prediction of outcomes. The signal-to-noise ratio can vary substantially across views, motivating more nuanced statistical tools beyond standard late and early fusion. This challenge comes with the need to preserve interpretability, select features, and obtain accurate uncertainty quantification. We propose a joint additive factor regression model (JAFAR) with a structured additive design, accounting for shared and view-specific components. We ensure identifiability via a novel dependent cumulative shrinkage process (D-CUSP) prior. We provide an efficient implementation via a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and extend our approach to allow flexible feature and outcome distributions.

At the forefront of this change is point cloud technology, offering an immersive experience that surpasses traditional 2D representations. However, the massive data size of point clouds presents significant challenges in data compression. Current methods for lossy point cloud attribute compression (PCAC) generally focus on reconstructing the original point clouds with minimal error. However, for point cloud visualization scenarios, the reconstructed point clouds with distortion still need to undergo a complex rendering process, which affects the final user-perceived quality. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that seamlessly integrates PCAC with differentiable rendering, denoted as rendering-oriented PCAC (RO-PCAC), directly targeting the quality of rendered multiview images for viewing. In a differentiable manner, the impact of the rendering process on the reconstructed point clouds is taken into account. Moreover, we characterize point clouds as sparse tensors and propose a sparse tensor-based transformer, called SP-Trans. By aligning with the local density of the point cloud and utilizing an enhanced local attention mechanism, SP-Trans captures the intricate relationships within the point cloud, further improving feature analysis and synthesis within the framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RO-PCAC achieves state-of-the-art compression performance, compared to existing reconstruction-oriented methods, including traditional, learning-based, and hybrid methods.</p></details> |  | None |

When dealing with geometric shapes with complicated geometric details, many existing algorithms suffer from high computational costs and memory usage. This paper proposes McGrids, a novel approach to improve the efficiency of iso-surface extraction. The key idea is to construct adaptive grids for iso-surface extraction rather than using a simple uniform grid as prior art does. Specifically, we formulate the problem of constructing adaptive grids as a probability sampling problem, which is then solved by Monte Carlo process. We demonstrate McGrids' capability with extensive experiments from both analytical SDFs computed from surface meshes and learned implicit fields from real multiview images. The experiment results show that our McGrids can significantly reduce the number of implicit field queries, resulting in significant memory reduction, while producing high-quality meshes with rich geometric details.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces a novel SSL approach, Information-Maximized Soft Variable Discretization (IMSVD), for image representation learning. Specifically, IMSVD softly discretizes each variable in the latent space, enabling the estimation of their probability distributions over training batches and allowing the learning process to be directly guided by information measures. Motivated by the MultiView assumption, we propose an information-theoretic objective function to learn transform-invariant, non-travail, and redundancy-minimized representation features. We then derive a joint-cross entropy loss function for self-supervised image representation learning, which theoretically enjoys superiority over the existing methods in reducing feature redundancy. Notably, our non-contrastive IMSVD method statistically performs contrastive learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IMSVD on various downstream tasks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

The audio-visual weak-correlation in such setting poses new challenges in deriving innovative methods to answer if or how we can use cross-modal information to solve the task. Towards this end, we propose to use an acoustic-camera rig consisting of a pinhole RGB-D camera and a coplanar four-channel microphone array~(Mic-Array). By using this rig to record audio-visual signals from multiviews, we can use the cross-modal cues to estimate the sound sources 3D locations. Specifically, our framework SoundLoc3D treats the task as a set prediction problem, each element in the set corresponds to a potential sound source. Given the audio-visual weak-correlation, the set representation is initially learned from a single view microphone array signal, and then refined by actively incorporating physical surface cues revealed from multiview RGB-D images. We demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of SoundLoc3D on large-scale simulated dataset, and further show its robustness to RGB-D measurement inaccuracy and ambient noise interference.</p></details> | Accepted by WACV2025 | None |

While adversarial vulnerabilities in 2D vision models have been extensively studied, the threat landscape for 3D generative models, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), remains underexplored. This work introduces \textit{AdvIRL}, a novel framework for crafting adversarial NeRF models using Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (Instant-NGP) and Reinforcement Learning. Unlike prior methods, \textit{AdvIRL} generates adversarial noise that remains robust under diverse 3D transformations, including rotations and scaling, enabling effective black-box attacks in real-world scenarios. Our approach is validated across a wide range of scenes, from small objects (e.g., bananas) to large environments (e.g., lighthouses). Notably, targeted attacks achieved high-confidence misclassifications, such as labeling a banana as a slug and a truck as a cannon, demonstrating the practical risks posed by adversarial NeRFs. Beyond attacking, \textit{AdvIRL}-generated adversarial models can serve as adversarial training data to enhance the robustness of vision systems. The implementation of \textit{AdvIRL} is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Tommy-Nguyen-cpu/AdvIRL/tree/MultiView-Clean}, ensuring reproducibility and facilitating future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Tommy-Nguyen-cpu/AdvIRL) |

However, current vehicle dispatch systems struggle to navigate the complexities of urban traffic dynamics, including unpredictable traffic conditions, diverse driver behaviors, and fluctuating supply and demand patterns. These challenges have resulted in travel difficulties for passengers in certain areas, while many drivers in other areas are unable to secure orders, leading to a decline in the overall quality of urban transportation services. To address these issues, this paper introduces GARLIC: a framework of GPT-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Intelligent Control for vehicle dispatching. GARLIC utilizes multiview graphs to capture hierarchical traffic states, and learns a dynamic reward function that accounts for individual driving behaviors. The framework further integrates a GPT model trained with a custom loss function to enable high-precision predictions and optimize dispatching policies in real-world scenarios. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that GARLIC effectively aligns with driver behaviors while reducing the empty load rate of vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DSplats: 3D Generation by Denoising Splats-Based Multiview Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09648v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-quality 3D content requires models capable of learning robust distributions of complex scenes and the real-world objects within them. Recent Gaussian-based 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved impressive results in recovering high-fidelity 3D assets from sparse input images by predicting 3D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. However, these techniques often lack the extensive priors and expressiveness offered by Diffusion Models. On the other hand, 2D Diffusion Models, which have been successfully applied to denoise multiview images, show potential for generating a wide range of photorealistic 3D outputs but still fall short on explicit 3D priors and consistency. In this work, we aim to bridge these two approaches by introducing DSplats, a novel method that directly denoises multiview images using Gaussian Splat-based Reconstructors to produce a diverse array of realistic 3D assets. To harness the extensive priors of 2D Diffusion Models, we incorporate a pretrained Latent Diffusion Model into the reconstructor backbone to predict a set of 3D Gaussians. Additionally, the explicit 3D representation embedded in the denoising network provides a strong inductive bias, ensuring geometrically consistent novel view generation. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DSplats not only produces high-quality, spatially consistent outputs, but also sets a new standard in single-image to 3D reconstruction. When evaluated on the Google Scanned Objects dataset, DSplats achieves a PSNR of 20.38, an SSIM of 0.842, and an LPIPS of 0.109.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we characterize the celebrated family of spectral methods for static clustering in terms of the low-rank approximation of high-dimensional node embeddings. From this perspective, it becomes natural to view the evolving community detection problem as one of subspace tracking on the Grassmann manifold. While the resulting optimization problem is nonconvex, we adopt a block majorize-minimize Riemannian optimization scheme to learn the Grassmann geodesic which best fits the data. Our framework generalizes any static spectral community detection approach and leads to algorithms achieving favorable performance on synthetic and real temporal networks, including those that are weighted, signed, directed, mixed-membership, multiview, hierarchical, cocommunity-structured, bipartite, or some combination thereof. We demonstrate how to specifically cast a wide variety of methods into our framework, and demonstrate greatly improved dynamic community detection results in all cases.</p></details> | 34 pages, 13 figures | None |

Our method, Position Based Dynamic Gaussians (PBDyG), realizes ``movement-dependent'' cloth deformation via physical simulation, rather than merely relying on ``pose-dependent'' rigid transformations. We model the clothed human holistically but with two distinct physical entities in contact: clothing modeled as 3D Gaussians, which are attached to a skinned SMPL body that follows the movement of the person in the input videos. The articulation of the SMPL body also drives physically-based simulation of the clothes' Gaussians to transform the avatar to novel poses. In order to run position based dynamics simulation, physical properties including mass and material stiffness are estimated from the RGB videos through Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only accurately reproduces appearance but also enables the reconstruction of avatars wearing highly deformable garments, such as skirts or coats, which have been challenging to reconstruct using existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we introduce Select Any Material (SAMa), a material selection approach for various 3D representations. Building on the recently introduced SAM2 video selection model, we extend its capabilities to the material domain. We leverage the model's cross-view consistency to create a 3D-consistent intermediate material-similarity representation in the form of a point cloud from a sparse set of views. Nearest-neighbour lookups in this similarity cloud allow us to efficiently reconstruct accurate continuous selection masks over objects' surfaces that can be inspected from any view. Our method is multiview-consistent by design, alleviating the need for contrastive learning or feature-field pre-processing, and performs optimization-free selection in seconds. Our approach works on arbitrary 3D representations and outperforms several strong baselines in terms of selection accuracy and multiview consistency. It enables several compelling applications, such as replacing the diffuse-textured materials on a text-to-3D output, or selecting and editing materials on NeRFs and 3D-Gaussians.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mfischer-ucl.github.io/sama</p></details> | [Code Link](https://mfischer-ucl.github.io/sama) |

We take the 3D planes as the main objective due to their compactness and structural expressiveness in indoor scenes, and develop an explicit optimization framework that learns to fit the expected surface of indoor scenes by splatting the 3D planes into 2.5D depth and normal maps. As our PlanarSplatting operates directly on the 3D plane primitives, it eliminates the dependencies on 2D/3D plane detection and plane matching and tracking for planar surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the essential merits of plane-based representation plus CUDA-based implementation of planar splatting functions, PlanarSplatting reconstructs an indoor scene in 3 minutes while having significantly better geometric accuracy. Thanks to our ultra-fast reconstruction speed, the largest quantitative evaluation on the ScanNet and ScanNet++ datasets over hundreds of scenes clearly demonstrated the advantages of our method. We believe that our accurate and ultrafast planar surface reconstruction method will be applied in the structured data curation for surface reconstruction in the future.

A handful of input images serve as keyframes, and our model interpolates between them to simulate a path moving between the cameras. Given random images, a model's ability to capture underlying geometry, recognize scene identity, and relate frames in terms of camera position and orientation reflects a fundamental understanding of 3D structure and scene layout. However, existing video models such as Luma Dream Machine fail at this task. We design a self-supervised method that takes advantage of the consistency of videos and variability of multiview internet photos to train a scalable, 3D-aware video model without any 3D annotations such as camera parameters. We validate that our method outperforms all baselines in terms of geometric and appearance consistency. We also show our model benefits applications that enable camera control, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our results suggest that we can scale up scene-level 3D learning using only 2D data such as videos and multiview internet photos.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiview Scene Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11187v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A proper scene representation is central to the pursuit of spatial intelligence where agents can robustly reconstruct and efficiently understand 3D scenes. A scene representation is either metric, such as landmark maps in 3D reconstruction, 3D bounding boxes in object detection, or voxel grids in occupancy prediction, or topological, such as pose graphs with loop closures in SLAM or visibility graphs in SfM. In this work, we propose to build Multiview Scene Graphs (MSG) from unposed images, representing a scene topologically with interconnected place and object nodes. The task of building MSG is challenging for existing representation learning methods since it needs to jointly address both visual place recognition, object detection, and object association from images with limited fields of view and potentially large viewpoint changes. To evaluate any method tackling this task, we developed an MSG dataset and annotation based on a public 3D dataset. We also propose an evaluation metric based on the intersection-over-union score of MSG edges. Moreover, we develop a novel baseline method built on mainstream pretrained vision models, combining visual place recognition and object association into one Transformer decoder architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method has superior performance compared to existing relevant baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

However, differences in these priors result in conflicting gradient directions during optimization, causing trade-offs between motion fidelity and geometry accuracy, and requiring substantial optimization time to reconcile the models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{P}ixel-\textbf{L}evel \textbf{A}lignment for text-driven \textbf{4D} Gaussian splatting (PLA4D) to resolve this motion-geometry conflict. PLA4D provides an anchor reference, i.e., text-generated video, to align the rendering process conditioned by different DMs in pixel space. For static alignment, our approach introduces a focal alignment method and Gaussian-Mesh contrastive learning to iteratively adjust focal lengths and provide explicit geometric priors at each timestep. At the dynamic level, a motion alignment technique and T-MV refinement method are employed to enforce both pose alignment and motion continuity across unknown viewpoints, ensuring intrinsic geometric consistency across views. With such pixel-level multi-DM alignment, our PLA4D framework is able to generate 4D objects with superior geometric, motion, and semantic consistency. Fully implemented with open-source tools, PLA4D offers an efficient and accessible solution for high-quality 4D digital content creation with significantly reduced generation time.</p></details> |  | None |

However, 3D and 4D generation remain challenging in real-world applications due to the lack of large-scale 4D data and effective model design. In this paper, we propose to jointly investigate general 3D and 4D generation by leveraging camera and object movements commonly observed in daily life. Due to the lack of real-world 4D data in the community, we first propose a data curation pipeline to obtain camera poses and object motion strength from videos. Based on this pipeline, we introduce a large-scale real-world 4D scene dataset: CamVid-30K. By leveraging all the 3D and 4D data, we develop our framework, GenXD, which allows us to produce any 3D or 4D scene. We propose multiview-temporal modules, which disentangle camera and object movements, to seamlessly learn from both 3D and 4D data. Additionally, GenXD employs masked latent conditions to support a variety of conditioning views. GenXD can generate videos that follow the camera trajectory as well as consistent 3D views that can be lifted into 3D representations. We perform extensive evaluations across various real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating GenXD's effectiveness and versatility compared to previous methods in 3D and 4D generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Different from prior works that rely on marker-based tracking and multiview cameras, ATS learns natural behaviors of animal and human agents non-invasively through video observations recorded over a long time-span (e.g., a month) in a single environment. Modeling 3D behavior of an agent requires persistent 3D tracking (e.g., knowing which point corresponds to which) over a long time period. To obtain such data, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration method that tracks the agent and the camera over time through a canonical 3D space, resulting in a complete and persistent spacetime 4D representation. We then train a generative model of agent behaviors using paired data of perception and motion of an agent queried from the 4D reconstruction. ATS enables real-to-sim transfer from video recordings of an agent to an interactive behavior simulator. We demonstrate results on pets (e.g., cat, dog, bunny) and human given monocular RGBD videos captured by a smartphone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gengshan-y.github.io/agent2sim-www/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://gengshan-y.github.io/agent2sim-www) |

Two main requirements lie in rendering and reconstruction. Notably, SOTA rendering quality is usually achieved with neural volumetric rendering techniques, which rely on aggregated point/primitive-wise color and neglect the underlying scene geometry. Learning of neural implicit surfaces is sparked from the success of neural rendering. Current works either constrain the distribution of density fields or the shape of primitives, resulting in degraded rendering quality and flaws on the learned scene surfaces. The efficacy of such methods is limited by the inherent constraints of the chosen neural representation, which struggles to capture fine surface details, especially for larger, more intricate scenes. To address these issues, we introduce GSDF, a novel dual-branch architecture that combines the benefits of a flexible and efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation with neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF). The core idea is to leverage and enhance the strengths of each branch while alleviating their limitation through mutual guidance and joint supervision. We show on diverse scenes that our design unlocks the potential for more accurate and detailed surface reconstructions, and at the meantime benefits 3DGS rendering with structures that are more aligned with the underlying geometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024.

In this paper, we propose modules to leverage 3D supervision from these sources to scale up the learning of models for reconstructing hand-held objects. Specifically, we extract multiview 2D mask supervision from videos and 3D shape priors from shape collections. We use these indirect 3D cues to train occupancy networks that predict the 3D shape of objects from a single RGB image.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying protein-DNA interactions is essential for elucidating various life activities. In recent years, machine learning-based models have been prominently utilized for DBP prediction. In this paper, to predict DBPs, we propose a novel framework termed a multiview random vector functional link (MvRVFL) network, which fuses neural network architecture with multiview learning. The proposed MvRVFL model combines the benefits of late and early fusion, allowing for distinct regularization parameters across different views while leveraging a closed-form solution to determine unknown parameters efficiently. The primal objective function incorporates a coupling term aimed at minimizing a composite of errors stemming from all views. From each of the three protein views of the DBP datasets, we extract five features. These features are then fused together by incorporating a hidden feature during the model training process. The performance of the proposed MvRVFL model on the DBP dataset surpasses that of baseline models, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. Furthermore, we extend our assessment to the UCI, KEEL, AwA, and Corel5k datasets, to establish the practicality of the proposed models. The consistency error bound, the generalization error bound, and empirical findings, coupled with rigorous statistical analyses, confirm the superior generalization capabilities of the MvRVFL model compared to the baseline models.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, existing methods struggle with space-view correspondences, resulting in sparse and low-quality outputs. In this paper, we introduce CoSER, a novel consistent dense Multiview Text-to-Image Generator for Text-to-3D, achieving both efficiency and quality by meticulously learning neighbor-view coherence and further alleviating ambiguity through the swift traversal of all views. For achieving neighbor-view consistency, each viewpoint densely interacts with adjacent viewpoints to perceive the global spatial structure, and aggregates information along motion paths explicitly defined by physical principles to refine details. To further enhance cross-view consistency and alleviate content drift, CoSER rapidly scan all views in spiral bidirectional manner to aware holistic information and then scores each point based on semantic material. Subsequently, we conduct weighted down-sampling along the spatial dimension based on scores, thereby facilitating prominent information fusion across all views with lightweight computation. Technically, the core module is built by integrating the attention mechanism with a selective state space model, exploiting the robust learning capabilities of the former and the low overhead of the latter. Extensive evaluation shows that CoSER is capable of producing dense, high-fidelity, content-consistent multiview images that can be flexibly integrated into various 3D generation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite numerous successful multiview-based SVM models, existing frameworks predominantly focus on the consensus principle, often overlooking the complementarity principle. Furthermore, they exhibit limited robustness against noisy, error-prone, and view-inconsistent samples, prevalent in multiview datasets. To tackle the aforementioned limitations, this paper introduces Wave-MvSVM, a novel multiview support vector machine framework leveraging the wave loss (W-loss) function, specifically designed to harness both consensus and complementarity principles. Unlike traditional approaches that often overlook the complementary information among different views, the proposed Wave-MvSVM ensures a more comprehensive and resilient learning process by integrating both principles effectively. The W-loss function, characterized by its smoothness, asymmetry, and bounded nature, is particularly effective in mitigating the adverse effects of noisy and outlier data, thereby enhancing model stability. Theoretically, the W-loss function also exhibits a crucial classification-calibrated property, further boosting its effectiveness. Wave-MvSVM employs a between-view co-regularization term to enforce view consistency and utilizes an adaptive combination weight strategy to maximize the discriminative power of each view. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using a combination of GD and the ADMM, ensuring reliable convergence to optimal solutions. Theoretical analyses, grounded in Rademacher complexity, validate the generalization capabilities of the Wave-MvSVM model. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Wave-MvSVM in comparison to existing benchmark models.</p></details> |  | None |

Several twin support vector machine-based MVL (MvTSVM) models have been introduced and demonstrated outstanding performance in various learning tasks. However, MvTSVM-based models face significant challenges in the form of computational complexity due to four matrix inversions, the need to reformulate optimization problems in order to employ kernel-generated surfaces for handling non-linear cases, and the constraint of uniform noise assumption in the training data. Particularly in cases where the data possesses a heteroscedastic error structure, these challenges become even more pronounced. In view of the aforementioned challenges, we propose multiview twin parametric margin support vector machine (MvTPMSVM). MvTPMSVM constructs parametric margin hyperplanes corresponding to both classes, aiming to regulate and manage the impact of the heteroscedastic noise structure existing within the data. The proposed MvTPMSVM model avoids the explicit computation of matrix inversions in the dual formulation, leading to enhanced computational efficiency. We perform an extensive assessment of the MvTPMSVM model using benchmark datasets such as UCI, KEEL, synthetic, and Animals with Attributes (AwA). Our experimental results, coupled with rigorous statistical analyses, confirm the superior generalization capabilities of the proposed MvTPMSVM model compared to the baseline models.

Recent multiview methods can be classified as sample-contrastive, dimension-contrastive, or asymmetric network-based, with each family having its own approach to avoiding informational collapse. While these families converge to solutions of similar quality, it can be empirically shown that some methods are epoch-inefficient and require longer training to reach a target performance. Two main approaches to improving efficiency are covariance eigenvalue regularization and using more views. However, these two approaches are difficult to combine due to the computational complexity of computing eigenvalues. We present the objective function FroSSL which reconciles both approaches while avoiding eigendecomposition entirely. FroSSL works by minimizing covariance Frobenius norms to avoid collapse and minimizing mean-squared error to achieve augmentation invariance. We show that FroSSL reaches competitive accuracies more quickly than any other SSL method and provide theoretical and empirical support that this faster convergence is due to how FroSSL affects the eigenvalues of the embedding covariance matrices. We also show that FroSSL learns competitive representations on linear probe evaluation when used to train a ResNet-18 on several datasets, including STL-10, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet-100.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 | None |

We prove the convergence of the model under traditional assumptions and provide convergence conditions for the algorithm in the presence of misleading signals. Through theoretical analyses and numerical experiments, we validate the strong reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SMA-Hyper: Spatiotemporal Multi-View Fusion Hypergraph Learning for Traffic Accident Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17642v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting traffic accidents is the key to sustainable city management, which requires effective address of the dynamic and complex spatiotemporal characteristics of cities. Current data-driven models often struggle with data sparsity and typically overlook the integration of diverse urban data sources and the high-order dependencies within them. Additionally, they frequently rely on predefined topologies or weights, limiting their adaptability in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these issues, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Multiview Adaptive HyperGraph Learning (SMA-Hyper) model, a dynamic deep learning framework designed for traffic accident prediction. Building on previous research, this innovative model incorporates dual adaptive spatiotemporal graph learning mechanisms that enable high-order cross-regional learning through hypergraphs and dynamic adaptation to evolving urban data. It also utilises contrastive learning to enhance global and local data representations in sparse datasets and employs an advance attention mechanism to fuse multiple views of accident data and urban functional features, thereby enriching the contextual understanding of risk factors. Extensive testing on the London traffic accident dataset demonstrates that the SMA-Hyper model significantly outperforms baseline models across various temporal horizons and multistep outputs, affirming the effectiveness of its multiview fusion and adaptive learning strategies. The interpretability of the results further underscores its potential to improve urban traffic management and safety by leveraging complex spatiotemporal urban data, offering a scalable framework adaptable to diverse urban environments.</p></details> |  | None |

In this context, we propose ConKeD, a novel deep learning approach to learn descriptors for retinal image registration. In contrast to current registration methods, our approach employs a novel multi-positive multi-negative contrastive learning strategy that enables the utilization of additional information from the available training samples. This makes it possible to learn high quality descriptors from limited training data. To train and evaluate ConKeD, we combine these descriptors with domain-specific keypoints, particularly blood vessel bifurcations and crossovers, that are detected using a deep neural network. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the novel multi-positive multi-negative strategy, as it outperforms the widely used triplet loss technique (single-positive and single-negative) as well as the single-positive multi-negative alternative. Additionally, the combination of ConKeD with the domain-specific keypoints produces comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods for retinal image registration, while offering important advantages such as avoiding pre-processing, utilizing fewer training samples, and requiring fewer detected keypoints, among others. Therefore, ConKeD shows a promising potential towards facilitating the development and application of deep learning-based methods for retinal image registration.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Structure-Aware Consensus Network on Graphs with Few Labeled Nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02188v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph node classification with few labeled nodes presents significant challenges due to limited supervision. Conventional methods often exploit the graph in a transductive learning manner. They fail to effectively utilize the abundant unlabeled data and the structural information inherent in graphs. To address these issues, we introduce a Structure-Aware Consensus Network (SACN) from three perspectives. Firstly, SACN leverages a novel structure-aware consensus learning strategy between two strongly augmented views. The proposed strategy can fully exploit the potentially useful information of the unlabeled nodes and the structural information of the entire graph. Secondly, SACN uniquely integrates the graph's structural information to achieve strong-to-strong consensus learning, improving the utilization of unlabeled data while maintaining multiview learning. Thirdly, unlike two-branch graph neural network-based methods, SACN is designed for multiview feature learning within a single-branch architecture. Furthermore, a class-aware pseudolabel selection strategy helps address class imbalance and achieve effective weak-to-strong supervision. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate SACN's superior performance in node classification tasks, particularly at very low label rates, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational simplicity.The source code is available at https://github.com/kunzhan/SACN</p></details> | under review | [Code Link](https://github.com/kunzhan/SACN) |

Key to our success is a novel dataset of multiview videos containing curated, rendered animated objects from Objaverse. This dataset depicts 44K diverse objects with 110K animations rendered in 48 viewpoints, resulting in 12M videos with a total of 300M frames. We keep our L4GM simple for scalability and build directly on top of LGM, a pretrained 3D Large Reconstruction Model that outputs 3D Gaussian ellipsoids from multiview image input. L4GM outputs a per-frame 3D Gaussian Splatting representation from video frames sampled at a low fps and then upsamples the representation to a higher fps to achieve temporal smoothness. We add temporal self-attention layers to the base LGM to help it learn consistency across time, and utilize a per-timestep multiview rendering loss to train the model. The representation is upsampled to a higher framerate by training an interpolation model which produces intermediate 3D Gaussian representations. We showcase that L4GM that is only trained on synthetic data generalizes extremely well on in-the-wild videos, producing high quality animated 3D assets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/l4gm</p></details> | None |
| **[Generative Lifting of Multiview to 3D from Unknown Pose: Wrapping NeRF inside Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06972v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We cast multiview reconstruction from unknown pose as a generative modeling problem. From a collection of unannotated 2D images of a scene, our approach simultaneously learns both a network to predict camera pose from 2D image input, as well as the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for the 3D scene. To drive learning, we wrap both the pose prediction network and NeRF inside a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and train the system via the standard denoising objective. Our framework requires the system accomplish the task of denoising an input 2D image by predicting its pose and rendering the NeRF from that pose. Learning to denoise thus forces the system to concurrently learn the underlying 3D NeRF representation and a mapping from images to camera extrinsic parameters. To facilitate the latter, we design a custom network architecture to represent pose as a distribution, granting implicit capacity for discovering view correspondences when trained end-to-end for denoising alone. This technique allows our system to successfully build NeRFs, without pose knowledge, for challenging scenes where competing methods fail. At the conclusion of training, our learned NeRF can be extracted and used as a 3D scene model; our full system can be used to sample novel camera poses and generate novel-view images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contrasting Multiple Representations with the Multi-Marginal Matching Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19532v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning meaningful representations of complex objects that can be seen through multiple ($k\geq 3$) views or modalities is a core task in machine learning. Existing methods use losses originally intended for paired views, and extend them to $k$ views, either by instantiating $\tfrac12k(k-1)$ loss-pairs, or by using reduced embeddings, following a \textit{one vs. average-of-rest} strategy. We propose the multi-marginal matching gap (M3G), a loss that borrows tools from multi-marginal optimal transport (MM-OT) theory to simultaneously incorporate all $k$ views. Given a batch of $n$ points, each seen as a $k$-tuple of views subsequently transformed into $k$ embeddings, our loss contrasts the cost of matching these $n$ ground-truth $k$-tuples with the MM-OT polymatching cost, which seeks $n$ optimally arranged $k$-tuples chosen within these $n\times k$ vectors. While the exponential complexity $O(n^k$) of the MM-OT problem may seem daunting, we show in experiments that a suitable generalization of the Sinkhorn algorithm for that problem can scale to, e.g., $k=3\sim 6$ views using mini-batches of size $64~\sim128$. Our experiments demonstrate improved performance over multiview extensions of pairwise losses, for both self-supervised and multimodal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at ICML 2024</p></details> | None |

However, all the existing methods represent the target object as a closed mesh devoid of any structural information, thus neglecting the part-based structure, which is crucial for many downstream applications, of the reconstructed shape. Moreover, the generated meshes usually suffer from large noises, unsmooth surfaces, and blurry textures, making it challenging to obtain satisfactory part segments using 3D segmentation techniques. In this paper, we present Part123, a novel framework for part-aware 3D reconstruction from a single-view image. We first use diffusion models to generate multiview-consistent images from a given image, and then leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM), which demonstrates powerful generalization ability on arbitrary objects, to generate multiview segmentation masks. To effectively incorporate 2D part-based information into 3D reconstruction and handle inconsistency, we introduce contrastive learning into a neural rendering framework to learn a part-aware feature space based on the multiview segmentation masks. A clustering-based algorithm is also developed to automatically derive 3D part segmentation results from the reconstructed models. Experiments show that our method can generate 3D models with high-quality segmented parts on various objects. Compared to existing unstructured reconstruction methods, the part-aware 3D models from our method benefit some important applications, including feature-preserving reconstruction, primitive fitting, and 3D shape editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2024 (conference track),webpage: https://liuar0512.github.io/part123_official_page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://liuar0512.github.io/part123_official_page) |
| **[MIMIC: Masked Image Modeling with Image Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15128v4)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense pixel-specific representation learning at scale has been bottlenecked due to the unavailability of large-scale multi-view datasets. Current methods for building effective pretraining datasets heavily rely on annotated 3D meshes, point clouds, and camera parameters from simulated environments, preventing them from building datasets from real-world data sources where such metadata is lacking. We propose a pretraining dataset-curation approach that does not require any additional annotations. Our method allows us to generate multi-view datasets from both real-world videos and simulated environments at scale. Specifically, we experiment with two scales: MIMIC-1M with 1.3M and MIMIC-3M with 3.1M multi-view image pairs. We train multiple models with different masked image modeling objectives to showcase the following findings: Representations trained on our automatically generated MIMIC-3M outperform those learned from expensive crowdsourced datasets (ImageNet-1K) and those learned from synthetic environments (MULTIVIEW-HABITAT) on two dense geometric tasks: depth estimation on NYUv2 (1.7%), and surface normals estimation on Taskonomy (2.05%). For dense tasks which also require object understanding, we outperform MULTIVIEW-HABITAT, on semantic segmentation on ADE20K (3.89%), pose estimation on MSCOCO (9.4%), and reduce the gap with models pre-trained on the object-centric expensive ImageNet-1K. We outperform even when the representations are frozen, and when downstream training data is limited to few-shot. Larger dataset (MIMIC-3M) significantly improves performance, which is promising since our curation method can arbitrarily scale to produce even larger datasets.

Regularised linear CCA methods can be seen to generalise Partial Least Squares (PLS) and be unified with a Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP) framework. However, classical algorithms for these linear methods are computationally infeasible for large-scale data. Extensions to Deep CCA show great promise, but current training procedures are slow and complicated. First we propose a novel unconstrained objective that characterizes the top subspace of GEPs. Our core contribution is a family of fast algorithms for stochastic PLS, stochastic CCA, and Deep CCA, simply obtained by applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to the corresponding CCA objectives. Our algorithms show far faster convergence and recover higher correlations than the previous state-of-the-art on all standard CCA and Deep CCA benchmarks. These improvements allow us to perform a first-of-its-kind PLS analysis of an extremely large biomedical dataset from the UK Biobank, with over 33,000 individuals and 500,000 features. Finally, we apply our algorithms to match the performance of `CCA-family' Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and also present theory to clarify the links between these methods and classical CCA, laying the groundwork for future insights.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WildFusion: Learning 3D-Aware Latent Diffusion Models in View Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13570v2)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern learning-based approaches to 3D-aware image synthesis achieve high photorealism and 3D-consistent viewpoint changes for the generated images. Existing approaches represent instances in a shared canonical space. However, for in-the-wild datasets a shared canonical system can be difficult to define or might not even exist. In this work, we instead model instances in view space, alleviating the need for posed images and learned camera distributions. We find that in this setting, existing GAN-based methods are prone to generating flat geometry and struggle with distribution coverage. We hence propose WildFusion, a new approach to 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent diffusion models (LDMs). We first train an autoencoder that infers a compressed latent representation, which additionally captures the images' underlying 3D structure and enables not only reconstruction but also novel view synthesis. To learn a faithful 3D representation, we leverage cues from monocular depth prediction. Then, we train a diffusion model in the 3D-aware latent space, thereby enabling synthesis of high-quality 3D-consistent image samples, outperforming recent state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. Importantly, our 3D-aware LDM is trained without any direct supervision from multiview images or 3D geometry and does not require posed images or learned pose or camera distributions. It directly learns a 3D representation without relying on canonical camera coordinates. This opens up promising research avenues for scalable 3D-aware image synthesis and 3D content creation from in-the-wild image data.

Thus, we propose Joint tEmporal and cAmera viewpoiNt alIgnmEnt (JEANIE) for sequence pairs. In particular, we focus on 3D skeleton sequences whose camera and subjects' poses can be easily manipulated in 3D. We evaluate JEANIE on skeletal Few-shot Action Recognition (FSAR), where matching well temporal blocks (temporal chunks that make up a sequence) of support-query sequence pairs (by factoring out nuisance variations) is essential due to limited samples of novel classes. Given a query sequence, we create its several views by simulating several camera locations. For a support sequence, we match it with view-simulated query sequences, as in the popular Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Specifically, each support temporal block can be matched to the query temporal block with the same or adjacent (next) temporal index, and adjacent camera views to achieve joint local temporal-viewpoint warping. JEANIE selects the smallest distance among matching paths with different temporal-viewpoint warping patterns, an advantage over DTW which only performs temporal alignment. We also propose an unsupervised FSAR akin to clustering of sequences with JEANIE as a distance measure. JEANIE achieves state-of-the-art results on NTU-60, NTU-120, Kinetics-skeleton and UWA3D Multiview Activity II on supervised and unsupervised FSAR, and their meta-learning inspired fusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV).

Moreover, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated their strong feature learning capabilities in MVC scenarios. However, effectively generalizing feature representations while maintaining consistency is still an intractable problem. In addition, most existing deep clustering methods based on contrastive learning overlook the consistency of the clustering representations during the clustering process. In this paper, we show how the above problems can be overcome and propose a consistent enhancement-based deep MVC method via contrastive learning (CCEC). Specifically, semantic connection blocks are incorporated into a feature representation to preserve the consistent information among multiple views. Furthermore, the representation process for clustering is enhanced through spectral clustering, and the consistency across multiple views is improved. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method in comparison with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

We learn pose dependent appearance and geometry from highly accurate dynamic mesh sequences obtained from state-of-the-art multiview-video reconstruction. Learning pose-dependent appearance and geometry from mesh sequences poses significant challenges, as it requires the network to learn the intricate shape and articulated motion of a human body. However, statistical body models like SMPL provide valuable a-priori knowledge which we leverage in order to constrain the dimension of the search space enabling more efficient and targeted learning and define pose-dependency. Instead of directly learning absolute pose-dependent geometry, we learn the difference between the observed geometry and the fitted SMPL model. This allows us to encode both pose-dependent appearance and geometry in the consistent UV space of the SMPL model. This approach not only ensures a high level of realism but also facilitates streamlined processing and rendering of virtual humans in real-time scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reconstructing Visual Stimulus Images from EEG Signals Based on Deep Visual Representation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06532v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing visual stimulus images is a significant task in neural decoding, and up to now, most studies consider the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as the signal source. However, the fMRI-based image reconstruction methods are difficult to widely applied because of the complexity and high cost of the acquisition equipments. Considering the advantages of low cost and easy portability of the electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition equipments, we propose a novel image reconstruction method based on EEG signals in this paper. Firstly, to satisfy the high recognizability of visual stimulus images in fast switching manner, we build a visual stimuli image dataset, and obtain the EEG dataset by a corresponding EEG signals collection experiment. Secondly, the deep visual representation model(DVRM) consisting of a primary encoder and a subordinate decoder is proposed to reconstruct visual stimuli. The encoder is designed based on the residual-in-residual dense blocks to learn the distribution characteristics between EEG signals and visual stimulus images, while the decoder is designed based on the deep neural network to reconstruct the visual stimulus image from the learned deep visual representation. The DVRM can fit the deep and multiview visual features of human natural state and make the reconstructed images more precise. Finally, we evaluate the DVRM in the quality of the generated images on our EEG dataset. The results show that the DVRM have good performance in the task of learning deep visual representation from EEG signals and generating reconstructed images that are realistic and highly resemble the original images.</p></details> |  | None |

Subspace clustering has been shown to be an effective approach for addressing this problem. However, current subspace clustering algorithms are mainly designed for a single view and do not fully exploit spatial or texture feature information in HSI. This study proposed a multiview subspace clustering of HSI based on graph convolutional networks. (1) This paper uses the powerful classification ability of graph convolutional network and the learning ability of topologi-cal relationships between nodes to analyze and express the spatial relation-ship of HSI. (2) Pixel texture and pixel neighbor spatial-spectral infor-mation were sent to construct two graph convolutional subspaces. (3) An attention-based fusion module was used to adaptively construct a more discriminative feature map. The model was evaluated on three popular HSI datasets, including Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Houston. It achieved overall accuracies of 92.38%, 93.43%, and 83.82%, respectively and significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art clustering methods.

We propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) technique to provide the model information about instance segmentation uncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by employing a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based, rotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label generation method provides multiple geometrically transformed images as inputs to a convolutional neural network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections generated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them using the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a single-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the targets. Our method also incorporates a multiview trajectory association mechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel across camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association performances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic airport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection accuracy by up to 42% without increasing the inference time of the model. Our multicamera association method achieves up to 89% multiobject tracking accuracy with an average computation time of less than 15 ms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 16 figures | None |

A key challenge lies in finding the exact correspondences between the dense keypoints in multiple views since the inverse of the keypoint mapping can be neither analytically derived nor differentiated. This limits applying existing multiview supervision approaches used to learn sparse keypoints that rely on the exact correspondences. To address this challenge, we derive a new probabilistic epipolar constraint that encodes the two desired properties. (1) Soft correspondence: we define a matchability, which measures a likelihood of a point matching to the other image's corresponding point, thus relaxing the requirement of the exact correspondences. (2) Geometric consistency: every point in the continuous correspondence fields must satisfy the multiview consistency collectively. We formulate a probabilistic epipolar constraint using a weighted average of epipolar errors through the matchability thereby generalizing the point-to-point geometric error to the field-to-field geometric error. This generalization facilitates learning a geometrically coherent dense keypoint detection model by utilizing a large number of unlabeled multiview images. Additionally, to prevent degenerative cases, we employ a distillation-based regularization by using a pretrained model. Finally, we design a new neural network architecture, made of twin networks, that effectively minimizes the probabilistic epipolar errors of all possible correspondences between two view images by building affinity matrices. Our method shows superior performance compared to existing methods, including non-differentiable bootstrapping in terms of keypoint accuracy, multiview consistency, and 3D reconstruction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at NeurIPS 2021</p></details> | None |

We propose iDeepViewLearn (Interpretable Deep Learning Method for Multiview Learning) for learning nonlinear relationships in data from multiple views while achieving feature selection. iDeepViewLearn combines deep learning flexibility with the statistical benefits of data and knowledge-driven feature selection, giving interpretable results. Deep neural networks are used to learn view-independent low-dimensional embedding through an optimization problem that minimizes the difference between observed and reconstructed data, while imposing a regularization penalty on the reconstructed data. The normalized Laplacian of a graph is used to model bilateral relationships between variables in each view, therefore, encouraging selection of related variables. iDeepViewLearn is tested on simulated and two real-world data, including breast cancer-related gene expression and methylation data. iDeepViewLearn had competitive classification results and identified genes and CpG sites that differentiated between individuals who died from breast cancer and those who did not. The results of our real data application and simulations with small to moderate sample sizes suggest that iDeepViewLearn may be a useful method for small-sample-size problems compared to other deep learning methods for multiview learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMC Bioinformatics (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-024-05679-9)</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of anatomical patterns and the random nature of lesion distribution in medical image segmentation pose significant challenges to the disentanglement of representations and the understanding of salient features. Methods guided by the maximization of mutual information, particularly within the framework of contrastive learning, have demonstrated remarkable success and superiority in decoupling densely intertwined representations. However, the effectiveness of contrastive learning highly depends on the quality of the positive and negative sample pairs, i.e. the unselected average mutual information among multi-views would obstruct the learning strategy so the selection of the views is vital. In this work, we introduce a novel approach predicated on representation distance-based mutual information (MI) maximization for measuring the significance of different views, aiming at conducting more efficient contrastive learning and representation disentanglement. Additionally, we introduce an MI re-ranking strategy for representation selection, benefiting both the continuous MI estimating and representation significance distance measuring. Specifically, we harness multi-view representations extracted from the frequency domain, re-evaluating their significance based on mutual information across varying frequencies, thereby facilitating a multifaceted contrastive learning approach to bolster semantic comprehension. The statistical results under the five metrics demonstrate that our proposed framework proficiently constrains the MI maximization-driven representation selection and steers the multi-view contrastive learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 algorithms</p></details> | None |

Recent advances from deep learning have shown promising prospects in fossil image identification. However, the quantity and quality of labeled fossil images are often limited due to fossil preservation, conditioned sampling, and expensive and inconsistent label annotation by domain experts, which pose great challenges to training deep learning based image classification models. To address these challenges, we follow the idea of the wisdom of crowds and propose a multiview ensemble framework, which collects Original (O), Gray (G), and Skeleton (S) views of each fossil image reflecting its different characteristics to train multiple base models, and then makes the final decision via soft voting. Experiments on the largest fusulinid dataset with 2400 images show that the proposed OGS consistently outperforms baselines (using a single model for each view), and obtains superior or comparable performance compared to OOO (using three base models for three the same Original views). Besides, as the training data decreases, the proposed framework achieves more gains. While considering the identification consistency estimation with respect to human experts, OGS receives the highest agreement with the original labels of dataset and with the re-identifications of two human experts. The validation performance provides a quantitative estimation of consistency across different experts and genera. We conclude that the proposed framework can present state-of-the-art performance in the fusulinid fossil identification case study.

| **[Deep Multiview Clustering by Contrasting Cluster Assignments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10769v4)** | 2024-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview clustering (MVC) aims to reveal the underlying structure of multiview data by categorizing data samples into clusters. Deep learning-based methods exhibit strong feature learning capabilities on large-scale datasets. For most existing deep MVC methods, exploring the invariant representations of multiple views is still an intractable problem. In this paper, we propose a cross-view contrastive learning (CVCL) method that learns view-invariant representations and produces clustering results by contrasting the cluster assignments among multiple views. Specifically, we first employ deep autoencoders to extract view-dependent features in the pretraining stage. Then, a cluster-level CVCL strategy is presented to explore consistent semantic label information among the multiple views in the fine-tuning stage. Thus, the proposed CVCL method is able to produce more discriminative cluster assignments by virtue of this learning strategy. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of soft cluster assignment alignment. Extensive experimental results obtained on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed CVCL method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Multiview Graph Learning with Consensus Graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13769v1)** | 2024-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph topology inference, i.e., learning graphs from a given set of nodal observations, is a significant task in many application domains. Existing approaches are mostly limited to learning a single graph assuming that the observed data is homogeneous. This is problematic because many modern datasets are heterogeneous or mixed and involve multiple related graphs, i.e., multiview graphs. Recent work proposing to learn multiview graphs ensures the similarity of learned view graphs through pairwise regularization, where each pair of views is encouraged to have similar structures. However, this approach cannot infer the shared structure across views. In this work, we propose an alternative method based on consensus regularization, where views are ensured to be similar through a learned consensus graph representing the common structure of the views. In particular, we propose an optimization problem, where graph data is assumed to be smooth over the multiview graph and the topology of the individual views and that of the consensus graph are learned, simultaneously. Our optimization problem is designed to be general in the sense that different regularization functions can be used depending on what the shared structure across views is. Moreover, we propose two regularization functions that extend fused and group graphical lasso to consensus based regularization. Proposed multiview graph learning is evaluated on simulated data and shown to have better performance than existing methods. It is also employed to infer the functional brain connectivity networks of multiple subjects from their electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The proposed method reveals the structure shared by subjects as well as the characteristics unique to each subject.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, the significant memory and computational costs of dense sampling in volume rendering have forced 3D GANs to adopt patch-based training or employ low-resolution rendering with post-processing 2D super resolution, which sacrifices multiview consistency and the quality of resolved geometry. Consequently, 3D GANs have not yet been able to fully resolve the rich 3D geometry present in 2D images. In this work, we propose techniques to scale neural volume rendering to the much higher resolution of native 2D images, thereby resolving fine-grained 3D geometry with unprecedented detail. Our approach employs learning-based samplers for accelerating neural rendering for 3D GAN training using up to 5 times fewer depth samples. This enables us to explicitly "render every pixel" of the full-resolution image during training and inference without post-processing superresolution in 2D. Together with our strategy to learn high-quality surface geometry, our method synthesizes high-resolution 3D geometry and strictly view-consistent images while maintaining image quality on par with baselines relying on post-processing super resolution. We demonstrate state-of-the-art 3D gemetric quality on FFHQ and AFHQ, setting a new standard for unsupervised learning of 3D shapes in 3D GANs.</p></details> | <details><summary>See o...</summary><p>See our project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nxp/wysiwyg/</p></details> | None |

However, learning generalizable NeRF priors over categories of scenes or objects has been challenging due to the high dimensionality of network weight space. To address the limitations of existing work on generalization, multi-view consistency and to improve quality, we propose HyP-NeRF, a latent conditioning method for learning generalizable category-level NeRF priors using hypernetworks. Rather than using hypernetworks to estimate only the weights of a NeRF, we estimate both the weights and the multi-resolution hash encodings resulting in significant quality gains. To improve quality even further, we incorporate a denoise and finetune strategy that denoises images rendered from NeRFs estimated by the hypernetwork and finetunes it while retaining multiview consistency. These improvements enable us to use HyP-NeRF as a generalizable prior for multiple downstream tasks including NeRF reconstruction from single-view or cluttered scenes and text-to-NeRF. We provide qualitative comparisons and evaluate HyP-NeRF on three tasks: generalization, compression, and retrieval, demonstrating our state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyp-nerf.github.io</p></details> | None |
| **[Inferring Hybrid Neural Fluid Fields from Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06561v1)** | 2023-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study recovering fluid density and velocity from sparse multiview videos. Existing neural dynamic reconstruction methods predominantly rely on optical flows; therefore, they cannot accurately estimate the density and uncover the underlying velocity due to the inherent visual ambiguities of fluid velocity, as fluids are often shapeless and lack stable visual features. The challenge is further pronounced by the turbulent nature of fluid flows, which calls for properly designed fluid velocity representations. To address these challenges, we propose hybrid neural fluid fields (HyFluid), a neural approach to jointly infer fluid density and velocity fields. Specifically, to deal with visual ambiguities of fluid velocity, we introduce a set of physics-based losses that enforce inferring a physically plausible velocity field, which is divergence-free and drives the transport of density. To deal with the turbulent nature of fluid velocity, we design a hybrid neural velocity representation that includes a base neural velocity field that captures most irrotational energy and a vortex particle-based velocity that models residual turbulent velocity. We show that our method enables recovering vortical flow details. Our approach opens up possibilities for various learning and reconstruction applications centered around 3D incompressible flow, including fluid re-simulation and editing, future prediction, and neural dynamic scene composition.

| **[A deep learning pipeline for cross-sectional and longitudinal multiview data integration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01238v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical research now commonly integrates diverse data types or views from the same individuals to better understand the pathobiology of complex diseases, but the challenge lies in meaningfully integrating these diverse views. Existing methods often require the same type of data from all views (cross-sectional data only or longitudinal data only) or do not consider any class outcome in the integration method, presenting limitations. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a pipeline that harnesses the power of statistical and deep learning methods to integrate cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources. Additionally, it identifies key variables contributing to the association between views and the separation among classes, providing deeper biological insights. This pipeline includes variable selection/ranking using linear and nonlinear methods, feature extraction using functional principal component analysis and Euler characteristics, and joint integration and classification using dense feed-forward networks and recurrent neural networks. We applied this pipeline to cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-omics data (metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) study and we identified microbial pathways, metabolites, and genes that discriminate by IBD status, providing information on the etiology of IBD. We conducted simulations to compare the two feature extraction methods. The proposed pipeline is available from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/lasandrall/DeepIDA-GRU.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/lasandrall/DeepIDA-GRU) |

Robustness against these attacks is of the utmost importance when designing computer vision applications, especially for safety-critical domains such as CCTV systems. In most practical situations, monitoring open spaces requires multi-view systems to overcome acquisition challenges such as occlusion handling. Multiview object systems are able to combine data from multiple views, and reach reliable detection results even in difficult environments. Despite its importance in real-world vision applications, the vulnerability of multiview systems to adversarial patches is not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we raise the following question: Does the increased performance and information sharing across views offer as a by-product robustness to adversarial patches? We first conduct a preliminary analysis showing promising robustness against off-the-shelf adversarial patches, even in an extreme setting where we consider patches applied to all views by all persons in Wildtrack benchmark. However, we challenged this observation by proposing two new attacks: (i) In the first attack, targeting a multiview CNN, we maximize the global loss by proposing gradient projection to the different views and aggregating the obtained local gradients. (ii) In the second attack, we focus on a Transformer-based multiview framework. In addition to the focal loss, we also maximize the transformer-specific loss by dissipating its attention blocks. Our results show a large degradation in the detection performance of victim multiview systems with our first patch attack reaching an attack success rate of 73% , while our second proposed attack reduced the performance of its target detector by 62%</p></details> |  | None |

Given a single RGB image or multiview images, our network infers a signed distance function (SDF) discretized on a tetrahedral mesh surrounding the body in a rest pose. Subsequently, inferred pose and camera parameters are used to generate a normal map from the SDF. A key aspect of our approach is the use of Marching Tetrahedra to (uniquely) compute a triangulated surface from the SDF on the tetrahedral mesh, facilitating straightforward differentiation (and thus backpropagation). Thus, given only ground truth normal maps (with no volumetric information ground truth information), we can train the network to produce SDF values from corresponding RGB images. Optionally, an additional multiview loss leads to improved results. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for both network inference and 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous decision support systems for appendicitis have focused on clinical, laboratory, scoring, and computed tomography data and have ignored abdominal ultrasound, despite its noninvasive nature and widespread availability. In this work, we present interpretable machine learning models for predicting the diagnosis, management and severity of suspected appendicitis using ultrasound images. Our approach utilizes concept bottleneck models (CBM) that facilitate interpretation and interaction with high-level concepts understandable to clinicians. Furthermore, we extend CBMs to prediction problems with multiple views and incomplete concept sets. Our models were trained on a dataset comprising 579 pediatric patients with 1709 ultrasound images accompanied by clinical and laboratory data. Results show that our proposed method enables clinicians to utilize a human-understandable and intervenable predictive model without compromising performance or requiring time-consuming image annotation when deployed. For predicting the diagnosis, the extended multiview CBM attained an AUROC of 0.80 and an AUPR of 0.92, performing comparably to similar black-box neural networks trained and tested on the same dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Medical Image Analysis (Elsevier)</p></details> | None |
| **[Exchanging Dual Encoder-Decoder: A New Strategy for Change Detection with Semantic Guidance and Spatial Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11302v1)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection is a critical task in earth observation applications. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising performance and are quickly adopted in change detection. However, the widely used multiple encoder and single decoder (MESD) as well as dual encoder-decoder (DED) architectures still struggle to effectively handle change detection well. The former has problems of bitemporal feature interference in the feature-level fusion, while the latter is inapplicable to intraclass change detection and multiview building change detection. To solve these problems, we propose a new strategy with an exchanging dual encoder-decoder structure for binary change detection with semantic guidance and spatial localization. The proposed strategy solves the problems of bitemporal feature inference in MESD by fusing bitemporal features in the decision level and the inapplicability in DED by determining changed areas using bitemporal semantic features. We build a binary change detection model based on this strategy, and then validate and compare it with 18 state-of-the-art change detection methods on six datasets in three scenarios, including intraclass change detection datasets (CDD, SYSU), single-view building change detection datasets (WHU, LEVIR-CD, LEVIR-CD+) and a multiview building change detection dataset (NJDS). The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance with high efficiency and outperforms all benchmark methods with F1-scores of 97.77%, 83.07%, 94.86%, 92.33%, 91.39%, 74.35% on CDD, SYSU, WHU, LEVIR-CD, LEVIR- CD+, and NJDS datasets, respectively.

However, invariance partially or totally removes transformation-related information from the representations, which might harm performance for specific downstream tasks that require such information. We propose 2D strUctured and EquivarianT representations (coined DUET), which are 2d representations organized in a matrix structure, and equivariant with respect to transformations acting on the input data. DUET representations maintain information about an input transformation, while remaining semantically expressive. Compared to SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) (unstructured and invariant) and ESSL (Dangovski et al., 2022) (unstructured and equivariant), the structured and equivariant nature of DUET representations enables controlled generation with lower reconstruction error, while controllability is not possible with SimCLR or ESSL.

This thesis focuses on retinal blood vessel segmentation tasks, providing an extensive literature review of deep learning-based medical image segmentation approaches while comparing the methodologies and empirical performances. The work also examines the limitations of current state-of-the-art methods by pointing out the two significant existing limitations: data size constraints and the dependency on high computational resources. To address such problems, this work proposes a novel efficient, simple multiview learning framework that contrastively learns invariant vessel feature representation by comparing with multiple augmented views by various transformations to overcome data shortage and improve generalisation ability. Moreover, the hybrid network architecture integrates the attention mechanism into a Convolutional Neural Network to further capture complex continuous curvilinear vessel structures. The result demonstrates the proposed method validated on the CHASE-DB1 dataset, attaining the highest F1 score of 83.46% and the highest Intersection over Union (IOU) score of 71.62% with UNet structure, surpassing existing benchmark UNet-based methods by 1.95% and 2.8%, respectively. The combination of the metrics indicates the model detects the vessel object accurately with a highly coincidental location with the ground truth. Moreover, the proposed approach could be trained within 30 minutes by consuming less than 3 GB GPU RAM, and such characteristics support the efficient implementation for real-world applications and deployments.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[MSFormer: A Skeleton-multiview Fusion Method For Tooth Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14489v1)** | 2023-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep learning-based tooth segmentation methods have been limited by the expensive and time-consuming processes of data collection and labeling. Achieving high-precision segmentation with limited datasets is critical. A viable solution to this entails fine-tuning pre-trained multiview-based models, thereby enhancing performance with limited data. However, relying solely on two-dimensional (2D) images for three-dimensional (3D) tooth segmentation can produce suboptimal outcomes because of occlusion and deformation, i.e., incomplete and distorted shape perception. To improve this fine-tuning-based solution, this paper advocates 2D-3D joint perception. The fundamental challenge in employing 2D-3D joint perception with limited data is that the 3D-related inputs and modules must follow a lightweight policy instead of using huge 3D data and parameter-rich modules that require extensive training data. Following this lightweight policy, this paper selects skeletons as the 3D inputs and introduces MSFormer, a novel method for tooth segmentation. MSFormer incorporates two lightweight modules into existing multiview-based models: a 3D-skeleton perception module to extract 3D perception from skeletons and a skeleton-image contrastive learning module to obtain the 2D-3D joint perception by fusing both multiview and skeleton perceptions. The experimental results reveal that MSFormer paired with large pre-trained multiview models achieves state-of-the-art performance, requiring only 100 training meshes. Furthermore, the segmentation accuracy is improved by 2.4%-5.5% with the increasing volume of training data.</p></details> | Under review | None |

Pre-trained Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are demonstrating their increasing capability in aiding the metaverse to achieve an excellent response with negligible delay, and nowadays, many large models are collaboratively trained by various participants in a manner named collaborative deep learning (CDL). However, several security weaknesses can threaten the safety of the CDL training process, which might result in fatal attacks to either the pre-trained large model or the local sensitive data sets possessed by an individual entity. In CDL, malicious participants can hide within the major innocent and silently uploads deceptive parameters to degenerate the model performance, or they can abuse the downloaded parameters to construct a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to acquire the private information of others illegally. To compensate for these vulnerabilities, this paper proposes an adversary detection-deactivation method, which can limit and isolate the access of potential malicious participants, quarantine and disable the GAN-attack or harmful backpropagation of received threatening gradients. A detailed protection analysis has been conducted on a Multiview CDL case, and results show that the protocol can effectively prevent harmful access by heuristic manner analysis and can protect the existing model by swiftly checking received gradients using only one low-cost branch with an embedded firewall.</p></details> |  | None |

With the use of this capacity, user interactions are made to meet their wants and preferences. 2) Using a complex method that interlaces Multiview voice chat information, the chatbot may precisely simulate users' actual experiences. This aids in developing more genuine and interesting discussions. 3) The study presents an original method for improving the black-box deep learning models' capacity for prediction. This improvement is made possible by introducing dynamic satisfaction measurements that are theory-driven, which leads to more precise forecasts of consumer reaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Multi...</summary><p>Multilingual , Voice Conversion , Emotion Recognition , Offline Service , Financial Advisor , Product Preference , Customer Reaction Prediction</p></details> | None |

An HSI cuboid with a specific patch size is utilized to extract spatial-spectral feature representation for the central pixel. In this article, we investigate that scene-specific but not essential correlations may be recorded in an HSI cuboid. This additional information improves the model performance on existing HSI datasets and makes it hard to properly evaluate the ability of a model. We refer to this problem as the spatial overfitting issue and utilize strict experimental settings to avoid it. We further propose a multiview transformer for HSI classification, which consists of multiview principal component analysis (MPCA), spectral encoder-decoder (SED), and spatial-pooling tokenization transformer (SPTT). MPCA performs dimension reduction on an HSI via constructing spectral multiview observations and applying PCA on each view data to extract low-dimensional view representation. The combination of view representations, named multiview representation, is the dimension reduction output of the MPCA. To aggregate the multiview information, a fully-convolutional SED with a U-shape in spectral dimension is introduced to extract a multiview feature map. SPTT transforms the multiview features into tokens using the spatial-pooling tokenization strategy and learns robust and discriminative spatial-spectral features for land cover identification. Classification is conducted with a linear classifier. Experiments on three HSI datasets with rigid settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multiview transformer over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advances in the Neural Radiance Field have predominantly targeted pin-hole cameras, and models for satellite cameras often demand sufficient input views. This paper presents rpcPRF, a Multiplane Images (MPI) based Planar neural Radiance Field for Rational Polynomial Camera (RPC). Unlike coordinate-based neural radiance fields in need of sufficient views of one scene, our model is applicable to single or few inputs and performs well on images from unseen scenes. To enable generalization across scenes, we propose to use reprojection supervision to induce the predicted MPI to learn the correct geometry between the 3D coordinates and the images. Moreover, we remove the stringent requirement of dense depth supervision from deep multiview-stereo-based methods by introducing rendering techniques of radiance fields. rpcPRF combines the superiority of implicit representations and the advantages of the RPC model, to capture the continuous altitude space while learning the 3D structure. Given an RGB image and its corresponding RPC, the end-to-end model learns to synthesize the novel view with a new RPC and reconstruct the altitude of the scene. When multiple views are provided as inputs, rpcPRF exerts extra supervision provided by the extra views. On the TLC dataset from ZY-3, and the SatMVS3D dataset with urban scenes from WV-3, rpcPRF outperforms state-of-the-art nerf-based methods by a significant margin in terms of image fidelity, reconstruction accuracy, and efficiency, for both single-view and multiview task.</p></details> |  | None |

We define this problem of intermittent instances of missing information (by occlusion, noise, or sensor failure) and design a learning framework around these data gaps, proposing and analyzing an imputation scheme to handle missing information. We apply these ideas to tasks in camera-based hand activity classification for robust safety during autonomous driving. We show that a late-fusion approach between parallel convolutional neural networks can outperform even the best-placed single camera model in estimating the hands' held objects and positions when validated on within-group subjects, and that our multi-camera framework performs best on average in cross-group validation, and that the fusion approach outperforms ensemble weighted majority and model combination schemes.</p></details> |  | None |

MADBAL also features a novel uncertainty formulation, where AL supporting modules are included to sense the features' maturity whose weighted influence continuously contributes to the uncertainty detection. In this way, MADBAL makes significant performance leaps even in the early AL stage, hence reducing the training burden significantly.

To facilitate the data efficiency of multiview learning, we further perform video-text alignment for first-person and third-person videos, to fully leverage the semantic knowledge to improve video representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our framework. Our method also outperforms multiple existing view-alignment methods, under the more challenging scenario than typical paired or unpaired multimodal or multiview learning.

| **[Contrastive Learning for Non-Local Graphs with Multi-Resolution Structural Views](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10077v1)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning node-level representations of heterophilic graphs is crucial for various applications, including fraudster detection and protein function prediction. In such graphs, nodes share structural similarity identified by the equivalence of their connectivity which is implicitly encoded in the form of higher-order hierarchical information in the graphs. The contrastive methods are popular choices for learning the representation of nodes in a graph. However, existing contrastive methods struggle to capture higher-order graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multiview contrastive learning approach that integrates diffusion filters on graphs. By incorporating multiple graph views as augmentations, our method captures the structural equivalence in heterophilic graphs, enabling the discovery of hidden relationships and similarities not apparent in traditional node representations. Our approach outperforms baselines on synthetic and real structural datasets, surpassing the best baseline by $16.06\%$ on Cornell, $3.27\%$ on Texas, and $8.04\%$ on Wisconsin. Additionally, it consistently achieves superior performance on proximal tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering structural information and improving downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |

To alleviate the label-hungry limitation, we propose a self-supervised learning framework, HaMuCo, that learns a single-view hand pose estimator from multi-view pseudo 2D labels. However, one of the main challenges of self-supervised learning is the presence of noisy labels and the ``groupthink'' effect from multiple views. To overcome these issues, we introduce a cross-view interaction network that distills the single-view estimator by utilizing the cross-view correlated features and enforcing multi-view consistency to achieve collaborative learning. Both the single-view estimator and the cross-view interaction network are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on multi-view self-supervised hand pose estimation. Furthermore, the proposed cross-view interaction network can also be applied to hand pose estimation from multi-view input and outperforms previous methods under the same settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2023.

This representation can be decoded for various tasks such as novel view rendering, 3D reconstruction (e.g. recovering depth, point clouds, or voxel maps), collision checking, and stable grasp prediction. We build our representation from a single RGB input image at test time by leveraging recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that learn category-level priors on large multiview datasets, then fine-tune on novel objects from one or few views. We expand the NeRF model for additional grasp outputs and explore ways to leverage this representation for robotics. At test-time, we build the representation from a single RGB input image observing the scene from only one viewpoint. We find that the recovered representation allows rendering from novel views, including of occluded object parts, and also for predicting successful stable grasps. Grasp poses can be directly decoded from our latent representation with an implicit grasp decoder. We experimented in both simulation and real world and demonstrated the capability for robust robotic grasping using such compact representation.

Improving the photorealism via CNN-based 2D super-resolution can break the strict 3D consistency, while keeping the 3D consistency by learning high-resolution 3D representations for direct rendering often compromises image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel learning strategy, namely 3D-to-2D imitation, which enables a 3D-aware GAN to generate high-quality images while maintaining their strict 3D consistency, by letting the images synthesized by the generator's 3D rendering branch to mimic those generated by its 2D super-resolution branch. We also introduce 3D-aware convolutions into the generator for better 3D representation learning, which further improves the image generation quality. With the above strategies, our method reaches FID scores of 5.4 and 4.3 on FFHQ and AFHQ-v2 Cats, respectively, at 512x512 resolution, largely outperforming existing 3D-aware GANs using direct 3D rendering and coming very close to the previous state-of-the-art method that leverages 2D super-resolution.

This quantity is based on a recently proposed matrix-based entropy that uses the eigenvalues of a normalized Gram matrix to compute an estimate of the eigenvalues of an uncentered covariance operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that a difference of matrix-based entropies (DiME) is well suited for problems involving the maximization of mutual information between random variables. While many methods for such tasks can lead to trivial solutions, DiME naturally penalizes such outcomes. We compare DiME to several baseline estimators of mutual information on a toy Gaussian dataset. We provide examples of use cases for DiME, such as latent factor disentanglement and a multiview representation learning problem where DiME is used to learn a shared representation among views with high mutual information.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies developed effective data-driven curriculum learning approaches for training graph neural networks in language applications. However, existing curriculum learning approaches often employ a single criterion of difficulty in their training paradigms. In this paper, we propose a new perspective on curriculum learning by introducing a novel approach that builds on graph complexity formalisms (as difficulty criteria) and model competence during training. The model consists of a scheduling scheme which derives effective curricula by accounting for different views of sample difficulty and model competence during training. The proposed solution advances existing research in curriculum learning for graph neural networks with the ability to incorporate a fine-grained spectrum of graph difficulty criteria in their training paradigms. Experimental results on real-world link prediction and node classification tasks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | ACL 2023 | None |

Previous work have demonstrated reasonable performance in novel view and pose synthesis, but they rely on a large number of images to train and are trained per scene from videos, which requires significant amount of time to produce animatable scenes from unseen human images. Our method differs from existing methods in that it can generalize to any input image for animatable human synthesis. Given a random pose sequence, our method synthesizes each target scene using a neural radiance field that is conditioned on a canonical representation and pose-aware pixel-aligned features, both of which can be obtained through deformation fields learned in a data-driven manner. Our experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiview and novel pose synthesis from few-shot images.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

| **[Factored Neural Representation for Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10950v3)** | 2023-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-standing goal in scene understanding is to obtain interpretable and editable representations that can be directly constructed from a raw monocular RGB-D video, without requiring specialized hardware setup or priors. The problem is significantly more challenging in the presence of multiple moving and/or deforming objects. Traditional methods have approached the setup with a mix of simplifications, scene priors, pretrained templates, or known deformation models. The advent of neural representations, especially neural implicit representations and radiance fields, opens the possibility of end-to-end optimization to collectively capture geometry, appearance, and object motion. However, current approaches produce global scene encoding, assume multiview capture with limited or no motion in the scenes, and do not facilitate easy manipulation beyond novel view synthesis. In this work, we introduce a factored neural scene representation that can directly be learned from a monocular RGB-D video to produce object-level neural presentations with an explicit encoding of object movement (e.g., rigid trajectory) and/or deformations (e.g., nonrigid movement). We evaluate ours against a set of neural approaches on both synthetic and real data to demonstrate that the representation is efficient, interpretable, and editable (e.g., change object trajectory).

By framing view similarities as dependencies and ensuring contrastivity by imposing orthonormality, HFMCA achieves faster convergence and increased stability in self-supervised learning. HFMCA defines and measures dependencies within image hierarchies, from pixels and patches to full images. We find that the network topology for approximating orthonormal basis functions aligns with a vanilla CNN, enabling the decomposition of density ratios between neighboring layers of feature maps. This approach provides powerful interpretability, revealing the resemblance between supervision and self-supervision through the lens of internal representations.</p></details> |  | None |

In practice, however, it is often very difficult to find a source RSI with exactly the same classes as the target RSI. More commonly, there are multiple source RSIs available. To this end, a novel class asymmetry RSIs domain adaptation method with multiple sources is proposed in this paper, which consists of four key components. Firstly, a multi-branch segmentation network is built to learn an expert for each source RSI. Secondly, a novel collaborative learning method with the cross-domain mixing strategy is proposed, to supplement the class information for each source while achieving the domain adaptation of each source-target pair. Thirdly, a pseudo-label generation strategy is proposed to effectively combine strengths of different experts, which can be flexibly applied to two cases where the source class union is equal to or includes the target class set. Fourthly, a multiview-enhanced knowledge integration module is developed for the high-level knowledge routing and transfer from multiple domains to target predictions.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures | None |

These speech data can reveal not only speech content and affective information but the speaker's identity, demographic traits, and health status. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning algorithm that coordinates clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing local data. This algorithm shows enormous potential for SER applications as sharing raw speech or speech features from a user's device is vulnerable to privacy attacks. However, a major challenge in FL is limited availability of high-quality labeled data samples. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised federated learning framework, Semi-FedSER, that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data samples to address the challenge of limited labeled data samples in FL. We show that our Semi-FedSER can generate desired SER performance even when the local label rate l=20 using two SER benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP and MSP-Improv.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted to Insterspeech 2022 for review</p></details> | None |

One of the primary assumptions of NCD is that the novel label space is perfectly disjoint and can be equipartitioned, but it is rarely realized by most NCD approaches in practice. To better align with this assumption, we propose a novel single-stage joint optimization-based NCD method, Negative learning, Entropy, and Variance regularization NCD (NEV-NCD). We demonstrate the efficacy of NEV-NCD in previously unexplored NCD applications of video action recognition (VAR) with the public UCF101 dataset and a curated in-house partial action-space annotated multi-view video dataset. We perform a thorough ablation study by varying the composition of final joint loss and associated hyper-parameters. During our experiments with UCF101 and multi-view action dataset, NEV-NCD achieves ~ 83% classification accuracy in test instances of labeled data. NEV-NCD achieves ~ 70% clustering accuracy over unlabeled data outperforming both naive baselines (by ~ 40%) and state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling-based approaches (by ~ 3.5%) over both datasets. Further, we propose to incorporate optional view-invariant feature learning with the multiview dataset to identify novel categories from novel viewpoints. Our additional view-invariance constraint improves the discriminative accuracy for both known and unknown categories by ~ 10% for novel viewpoints.</p></details> |  | None |

State-of-the-art DMSs leverage multiple sensors mounted at different locations to monitor the driver and the vehicle's interior scene and employ decision-level fusion to integrate these heterogenous data. However, this fusion method may not fully utilize the complementarity of different data sources and may overlook their relative importance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multiview multimodal driver monitoring system based on feature-level fusion through multi-head self-attention (MHSA). We demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it against four alternative fusion strategies (Sum, Conv, SE, and AFF). We also present a novel GPU-friendly supervised contrastive learning framework SuMoCo to learn better representations. Furthermore, We fine-grained the test split of the DAD dataset to enable the multi-class recognition of drivers' activities. Experiments on this enhanced database demonstrate that 1) the proposed MHSA-based fusion method (AUC-ROC: 97.0\%) outperforms all baselines and previous approaches, and 2) training MHSA with patch masking can improve its robustness against modality/view collapses.

The proposed methods model nonlinear relationships in multiview data together with predicting a clinical outcome and are capable of identifying variables or groups of variables that best contribute to the relationships among the views. We use the idea that random Fourier bases can approximate shift-invariant kernel functions to construct nonlinear mappings of each view and we use these mappings and the outcome variable to learn view-independent low-dimensional representations. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed methods outperform several other linear and nonlinear methods for multiview data integration. When the proposed methods were applied to gene expression, metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics data pertaining to COVID-19, we identified several molecular signatures forCOVID-19 status and severity.

To achieve this, we first propose a novel neural renderer with decomposed rendering components to learn the interaction between surface and environment lighting. This renderer is trained using existing physically based renderers and is decoupled from actual scene representations. We then propose an SDF-based neural surface model that leverages this learned neural renderer to represent general scenes.

Most existing methods rely on 2D generative models which often leads to obvious 3D inconsistency artifacts. We present a 3D-consistent novel view synthesis approach for monocular portrait images based on a recent proposed 3D-aware GAN, namely Generative Radiance Manifolds (GRAM), which has shown strong 3D consistency at multiview image generation of virtual subjects via the radiance manifolds representation. However, simply learning an encoder to map a real image into the latent space of GRAM can only reconstruct coarse radiance manifolds without faithful fine details, while improving the reconstruction fidelity via instance-specific optimization is time-consuming. We introduce a novel detail manifolds reconstructor to learn 3D-consistent fine details on the radiance manifolds from monocular images, and combine them with the coarse radiance manifolds for high-fidelity reconstruction. The 3D priors derived from the coarse radiance manifolds are used to regulate the learned details to ensure reasonable synthesized results at novel views. Trained on in-the-wild 2D images, our method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent portrait synthesis largely outperforming the prior art.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2023 camera-ready version.

While NeRFs are quickly being adapted for a wider set of applications, intuitively editing NeRF scenes is still an open challenge. One important editing task is the removal of unwanted objects from a 3D scene, such that the replaced region is visually plausible and consistent with its context. We refer to this task as 3D inpainting. In 3D, solutions must be both consistent across multiple views and geometrically valid. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D inpainting method that addresses these challenges. Given a small set of posed images and sparse annotations in a single input image, our framework first rapidly obtains a 3D segmentation mask for a target object. Using the mask, a perceptual optimizationbased approach is then introduced that leverages learned 2D image inpainters, distilling their information into 3D space, while ensuring view consistency. We also address the lack of a diverse benchmark for evaluating 3D scene inpainting methods by introducing a dataset comprised of challenging real-world scenes. In particular, our dataset contains views of the same scene with and without a target object, enabling more principled benchmarking of the 3D inpainting task. We first demonstrate the superiority of our approach on multiview segmentation, comparing to NeRFbased methods and 2D segmentation approaches. We then evaluate on the task of 3D inpainting, establishing state-ofthe-art performance against other NeRF manipulation algorithms, as well as a strong 2D image inpainter baseline.

We, for the first time, propose a multiview RGB-based 6-DoF grasp detection network, GraspNeRF, that leverages the generalizable neural radiance field (NeRF) to achieve material-agnostic object grasping in clutter. Compared to the existing NeRF-based 3-DoF grasp detection methods that rely on densely captured input images and time-consuming per-scene optimization, our system can perform zero-shot NeRF construction with sparse RGB inputs and reliably detect 6-DoF grasps, both in real-time. The proposed framework jointly learns generalizable NeRF and grasp detection in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the scene representation construction for the grasping. For training data, we generate a large-scale photorealistic domain-randomized synthetic dataset of grasping in cluttered tabletop scenes that enables direct transfer to the real world.

To better comprehend long complicated sentences and obtain accurate aspect-specific information, linguistic and commonsense knowledge are generally required in this task. However, most current methods employ complicated and inefficient approaches to incorporate external knowledge, e.g., directly searching the graph nodes. Additionally, the complementarity between external knowledge and linguistic information has not been thoroughly studied. To this end, we propose a knowledge graph augmented network KGAN, which aims to effectively incorporate external knowledge with explicitly syntactic and contextual information. In particular, KGAN captures the sentiment feature representations from multiple different perspectives, i.e., context-, syntax- and knowledge-based. First, KGAN learns the contextual and syntactic representations in parallel to fully extract the semantic features. Then, KGAN integrates the knowledge graphs into the embedding space, based on which the aspect-specific knowledge representations are further obtained via an attention mechanism. Last, we propose a hierarchical fusion module to complement these multi-view representations in a local-to-global manner. Extensive experiments on five popular ABSA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our KGAN. Notably, with the help of the pretrained model of RoBERTa, KGAN achieves a new record of state-of-the-art performance among all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TKDE 2023</p></details> | None |

However, the high computational cost associated with multiple views poses a significant challenge for end devices with limited computational resources. To address this issue, we propose a view selection approach that analyzes the target object or scenario from given views and selects the next best view for processing. Our approach features a reinforcement learning based camera selection module, MVSelect, that not only selects views but also facilitates joint training with the task network. Experimental results on multiview classification and detection tasks show that our approach achieves promising performance while using only 2 or 3 out of N available views, significantly reducing computational costs. Furthermore, analysis on the selected views reveals that certain cameras can be shut off with minimal performance impact, shedding light on future camera layout optimization for multiview systems.

While promising for object-level surfaces, these methods suffer when coping with complex scene surfaces. In the meanwhile, traditional multi-view stereo can recover the geometry of scenes with rich textures, by globally optimizing the local, pixel-wise correspondences across multiple views. We are thus motivated to make use of the complementary benefits from the two strategies, and propose a method termed Helix-shaped neural implicit Surface learning or HelixSurf; HelixSurf uses the intermediate prediction from one strategy as the guidance to regularize the learning of the other one, and conducts such intertwined regularization iteratively during the learning process. We also propose an efficient scheme for differentiable volume rendering in HelixSurf. Experiments on surface reconstruction of indoor scenes show that our method compares favorably with existing methods and is orders of magnitude faster, even when some of existing methods are assisted with auxiliary training data.

| **[Localizing Scan Targets from Human Pose for Autonomous Lung Ultrasound Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07867v2)** | 2023-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound is progressing toward becoming an affordable and versatile solution to medical imaging. With the advent of COVID-19 global pandemic, there is a need to fully automate ultrasound imaging as it requires trained operators in close proximity to patients for a long period of time, therefore increasing risk of infection. In this work, we investigate the important yet seldom-studied problem of scan target localization, under the setting of lung ultrasound imaging. We propose a purely vision-based, data driven method that incorporates learning-based computer vision techniques. We combine a human pose estimation model with a specially designed regression model to predict the lung ultrasound scan targets, and deploy multiview stereo vision to enhance the consistency of 3D target localization. While related works mostly focus on phantom experiments, we collect data from 30 human subjects for testing. Our method attains an accuracy level of 16.00(9.79) mm for probe positioning and 4.44(3.75) degree for probe orientation, with a success rate above 80% under an error threshold of 25mm for all scan targets. Moreover, our approach can serve as a general solution to other types of ultrasound modalities. The code for implementation has been released.</p></details> | v2 2023/02/25 | None |

To solve data sparsity problem in multiview ratings, we propose a generic architecture of deep transfer tensor factorization (DTTF) by integrating deep learning and cross-domain tensor factorization, where the side information is embedded to provide effective compensation for the tensor sparsity. Then we exhibit instantiation of our architecture by combining stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and CANDECOMP/ PARAFAC (CP) tensor factorization in both source and target domains, where the side information of both users and items is tightly coupled with the sparse multi-view ratings and the latent factors are learned based on the joint optimization. We tightly couple the multi-view ratings and the side information to improve cross-domain tensor factorization based recommendations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our DTTF schemes outperform state-of-the-art methods on multi-view rating predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Data Mining 2022 Workshop MRL</p></details> | None |

Triplet similarity comparison is a type of crowdsourcing task, in which crowd workers are asked the question ``among three given objects, which two are more similar?'', which is relatively easy for humans to answer. However, the comparison can be sometimes based on multiple views, i.e., different independent attributes such as color and shape. Each view may lead to different results for the same three objects. Although an algorithm was proposed in prior work to produce multiview embeddings, it involves at least two problems: (1) the existing algorithm cannot independently predict multiview embeddings for a new sample, and (2) different people may prefer different views. In this study, we propose an end-to-end inductive deep learning framework to solve the multiview representation learning problem. The results show that our proposed method can obtain multiview embeddings of any object, in which each view corresponds to an independent attribute of the object. We collected two datasets from a crowdsourcing platform to experimentally investigate the performance of our proposed approach compared to conventional baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables, Accepted for WWW 2023</p></details> | None |

Contrastive learning (CL), which is a popular self-supervised learning method, has recently attracted considerable attention. Most CL-based methods were constructed only from the sample level. In this study, we propose a novel multiview feature extraction method based on dual contrastive head, which introduce structural-level contrastive loss into sample-level CL-based method. Structural-level CL push the potential subspace structures consistent in any two cross views, which assists sample-level CL to extract discriminative features more effectively. Furthermore, it is proven that the relationships between structural-level CL and mutual information and probabilistic intraand inter-scatter, which provides the theoretical support for the excellent performance. Finally, numerical experiments on six real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Protein Representation Learning by Geometric Structure Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06125v5)** | 2023-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective protein representations is critical in a variety of tasks in biology such as predicting protein function or structure. Existing approaches usually pretrain protein language models on a large number of unlabeled amino acid sequences and then finetune the models with some labeled data in downstream tasks. Despite the effectiveness of sequence-based approaches, the power of pretraining on known protein structures, which are available in smaller numbers only, has not been explored for protein property prediction, though protein structures are known to be determinants of protein function. In this paper, we propose to pretrain protein representations according to their 3D structures. We first present a simple yet effective encoder to learn the geometric features of a protein. We pretrain the protein graph encoder by leveraging multiview contrastive learning and different self-prediction tasks. Experimental results on both function prediction and fold classification tasks show that our proposed pretraining methods outperform or are on par with the state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, while using much less pretraining data.

Comparatively, 3D poses new challenges stemming from occlusions not depicted in the image. Prior works try to overcome these by inferring from multiple views or rely on scarce CAD models and category-specific priors which hinder scaling to novel settings. In this work, we explore single-view 3D reconstruction by learning generalizable representations inspired by advances in self-supervised learning. We introduce a simple framework that operates on 3D points of single objects or whole scenes coupled with category-agnostic large-scale training from diverse RGB-D videos. Our model, Multiview Compressive Coding (MCC), learns to compress the input appearance and geometry to predict the 3D structure by querying a 3D-aware decoder. MCC's generality and efficiency allow it to learn from large-scale and diverse data sources with strong generalization to novel objects imagined by DALL$\cdot$E 2 or captured in-the-wild with an iPhone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mcc3d.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, challenges remain on designing an attention mechanism to explore the multiview features and exploit their relations for reinforcing the encoding-decoding modules. This paper proposes a new model, namely 3D coarse-to-fine transformer (3D-C2FT), by introducing a novel coarse-to-fine(C2F) attention mechanism for encoding multi-view features and rectifying defective 3D objects. C2F attention mechanism enables the model to learn multi-view information flow and synthesize 3D surface correction in a coarse to fine-grained manner. The proposed model is evaluated by ShapeNet and Multi-view Real-life datasets. Experimental results show that 3D-C2FT achieves notable results and outperforms several competing models on these datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2022</p></details> | None |
| **[A Generalized EigenGame with Extensions to Multiview Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11323v3)** | 2023-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) encompass a range of interesting dimensionality reduction methods. Development of efficient stochastic approaches to these problems would allow them to scale to larger datasets. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is one example of a GEP for dimensionality reduction which has found extensive use in problems with two or more views of the data. Deep learning extensions of CCA require large mini-batch sizes, and therefore large memory consumption, in the stochastic setting to achieve good performance and this has limited its application in practice. Inspired by the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm, we develop an approach to solving stochastic GEPs in which all constraints are softly enforced by Lagrange multipliers. Then by considering the integral of this Lagrangian function, its pseudo-utility, and inspired by recent formulations of Principal Components Analysis and GEPs as games with differentiable utilities, we develop a game-theory inspired approach to solving GEPs. We show that our approaches share much of the theoretical grounding of the previous Hebbian and game theoretic approaches for the linear case but our method permits extension to general function approximators like neural networks for certain GEPs for dimensionality reduction including CCA which means our method can be used for deep multiview representation learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for solving GEPs in the stochastic setting using canonical multiview datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for optimizing Deep CCA.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Community detection in multiplex networks based on orthogonal nonnegative matrix tri-factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00626v2)** | 2023-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks are commonly used to model complex systems. The different entities in the system are represented by nodes of the network and their interactions by edges. In most real life systems, the different entities may interact in different ways necessitating the use of multiplex networks where multiple links are used to model the interactions. One of the major tools for inferring network topology is community detection. Although there are numerous works on community detection in single-layer networks, existing community detection methods for multiplex networks mostly learn a common community structure across layers and do not take the heterogeneity across layers into account. In this paper, we introduce a new multiplex community detection method that identifies communities that are common across layers as well as those that are unique to each layer. The proposed method, Multiplex Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization, represents the adjacency matrix of each layer as the sum of two low-rank matrix factorizations corresponding to the common and private communities, respectively. Unlike most of the existing methods, which require the number of communities to be pre-determined, the proposed method also introduces a two stage method to determine the number of common and private communities. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and real multiplex networks, as well as for multiview clustering applications, and compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Correspondence Estimation via Multiview Registration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03236v1)** | 2022-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video provides us with the spatio-temporal consistency needed for visual learning. Recent approaches have utilized this signal to learn correspondence estimation from close-by frame pairs. However, by only relying on close-by frame pairs, those approaches miss out on the richer long-range consistency between distant overlapping frames. To address this, we propose a self-supervised approach for correspondence estimation that learns from multiview consistency in short RGB-D video sequences. Our approach combines pairwise correspondence estimation and registration with a novel SE(3) transformation synchronization algorithm. Our key insight is that self-supervised multiview registration allows us to obtain correspondences over longer time frames; increasing both the diversity and difficulty of sampled pairs. We evaluate our approach on indoor scenes for correspondence estimation and RGB-D pointcloud registration and find that we perform on-par with supervised approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2023.

| **[Private Multiparty Perception for Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.00912v1)** | 2022-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework for navigating through cluttered environments by connecting multiple cameras together while simultaneously preserving privacy. Occlusions and obstacles in large environments are often challenging situations for navigation agents because the environment is not fully observable from a single camera view. Given multiple camera views of an environment, our approach learns to produce a multiview scene representation that can only be used for navigation, provably preventing one party from inferring anything beyond the output task. On a new navigation dataset that we will publicly release, experiments show that private multiparty representations allow navigation through complex scenes and around obstacles while jointly preserving privacy. Our approach scales to an arbitrary number of camera viewpoints. We believe developing visual representations that preserve privacy is increasingly important for many applications such as navigation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Equivalence Between SE(3) Equivariant Networks via Steerable Kernels and Group Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15903v1)** | 2022-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A wide range of techniques have been proposed in recent years for designing neural networks for 3D data that are equivariant under rotation and translation of the input. Most approaches for equivariance under the Euclidean group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ of rotations and translations fall within one of the two major categories. The first category consists of methods that use $\mathrm{SE}(3)$-convolution which generalizes classical $\mathbb{R}^3$-convolution on signals over $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. Alternatively, it is possible to use \textit{steerable convolution} which achieves $\mathrm{SE}(3)$-equivariance by imposing constraints on $\mathbb{R}^3$-convolution of tensor fields. It is known by specialists in the field that the two approaches are equivalent, with steerable convolution being the Fourier transform of $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ convolution. Unfortunately, these results are not widely known and moreover the exact relations between deep learning architectures built upon these two approaches have not been precisely described in the literature on equivariant deep learning. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of both methods and their equivalence and relate the two constructions to multiview convolutional networks. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justifications of separability of $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ group convolution, which explain the applicability and success of some recent approaches. Finally, we express different methods using a single coherent formalism and provide explicit formulas that relate the kernels learned by different methods. In this way, our work helps to unify different previously-proposed techniques for achieving roto-translational equivariance, and helps to shed light on both the utility and precise differences between various alternatives. We also derive new TFN non-linearities from our equivalence principle and test them on practical benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Local Manifold Augmentation for Multiview Semantic Consistency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02798v1)** | 2022-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview self-supervised representation learning roots in exploring semantic consistency across data of complex intra-class variation. Such variation is not directly accessible and therefore simulated by data augmentations. However, commonly adopted augmentations are handcrafted and limited to simple geometrical and color changes, which are unable to cover the abundant intra-class variation. In this paper, we propose to extract the underlying data variation from datasets and construct a novel augmentation operator, named local manifold augmentation (LMA). LMA is achieved by training an instance-conditioned generator to fit the distribution on the local manifold of data and sampling multiview data using it. LMA shows the ability to create an infinite number of data views, preserve semantics, and simulate complicated variations in object pose, viewpoint, lighting condition, background etc. Experiments show that with LMA integrated, self-supervised learning methods such as MoCov2 and SimSiam gain consistent improvement on prevalent benchmarks including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, ImageNet100, and ImageNet. Furthermore, LMA leads to representations that obtain more significant invariance to the viewpoint, object pose, and illumination changes and stronger robustness to various real distribution shifts reflected by ImageNet-V2, ImageNet-R, ImageNet Sketch etc.</p></details> |  | None |

Sequences are encoded with a temporal block encoder based on Simple Spectral Graph Convolution, a lightweight linear Graph Neural Network backbone. We also include a setting with a transformer.

| **[Multi-view Representation Learning from Malware to Defend Against Adversarial Variants](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15429v1)** | 2022-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based adversarial malware detectors have yielded promising results in detecting never-before-seen malware executables without relying on expensive dynamic behavior analysis and sandbox. Despite their abilities, these detectors have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial malware variants - meticulously modified, functionality-preserving versions of original malware executables generated by machine learning. Due to the nature of these adversarial modifications, these adversarial methods often use a \textit{single view} of malware executables (i.e., the binary/hexadecimal view) to generate adversarial malware variants. This provides an opportunity for the defenders (i.e., malware detectors) to detect the adversarial variants by utilizing more than one view of a malware file (e.g., source code view in addition to the binary view). The rationale behind this idea is that while the adversary focuses on the binary view, certain characteristics of the malware file in the source code view remain untouched which leads to the detection of the adversarial malware variants. To capitalize on this opportunity, we propose Adversarially Robust Multiview Malware Defense (ARMD), a novel multi-view learning framework to improve the robustness of DL-based malware detectors against adversarial variants. Our experiments on three renowned open-source deep learning-based malware detectors across six common malware categories show that ARMD is able to improve the adversarial robustness by up to seven times on these malware detectors.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AniFaceGAN: Animatable 3D-Aware Face Image Generation for Video Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06465v1)** | 2022-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although 2D generative models have made great progress in face image generation and animation, they often suffer from undesirable artifacts such as 3D inconsistency when rendering images from different camera viewpoints. This prevents them from synthesizing video animations indistinguishable from real ones. Recently, 3D-aware GANs extend 2D GANs for explicit disentanglement of camera pose by leveraging 3D scene representations. These methods can well preserve the 3D consistency of the generated images across different views, yet they cannot achieve fine-grained control over other attributes, among which facial expression control is arguably the most useful and desirable for face animation. In this paper, we propose an animatable 3D-aware GAN for multiview consistent face animation generation. The key idea is to decompose the 3D representation of the 3D-aware GAN into a template field and a deformation field, where the former represents different identities with a canonical expression, and the latter characterizes expression variations of each identity. To achieve meaningful control over facial expressions via deformation, we propose a 3D-level imitative learning scheme between the generator and a parametric 3D face model during adversarial training of the 3D-aware GAN. This helps our method achieve high-quality animatable face image generation with strong visual 3D consistency, even though trained with only unstructured 2D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance over prior works.

| **[Cooperative learning for multiview analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12337v6)** | 2022-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method for supervised learning with multiple sets of features ("views"). The multiview problem is especially important in biology and medicine, where "-omics" data such as genomics, proteomics and radiomics are measured on a common set of samples. Cooperative learning combines the usual squared error loss of predictions with an "agreement" penalty to encourage the predictions from different data views to agree. By varying the weight of the agreement penalty, we get a continuum of solutions that include the well-known early and late fusion approaches. Cooperative learning chooses the degree of agreement (or fusion) in an adaptive manner, using a validation set or cross-validation to estimate test set prediction error. One version of our fitting procedure is modular, where one can choose different fitting mechanisms (e.g. lasso, random forests, boosting, neural networks) appropriate for different data views. In the setting of cooperative regularized linear regression, the method combines the lasso penalty with the agreement penalty, yielding feature sparsity. The method can be especially powerful when the different data views share some underlying relationship in their signals that can be exploited to boost the signals. We show that cooperative learning achieves higher predictive accuracy on simulated data and a real multiomics example of labor onset prediction. Leveraging aligned signals and allowing flexible fitting mechanisms for different modalities, cooperative learning offers a powerful approach to multiomics data fusion.</p></details> |  | None |

Each of the possible input modalities describes human behaviour in a different way, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. We explore the hypothesis that leveraging multiple modalities can lead to better recognition. Since manual annotation of input data is expensive and time-consuming, the emphasis is made on self-supervised methods which can learn useful feature representations without any ground truth labels. We extend a number of recent contrastive self-supervised approaches for the task of Human Activity Recognition, leveraging inertial and skeleton data. Furthermore, we propose a flexible, general-purpose framework for performing multimodal self-supervised learning, named Contrastive Multiview Coding with Cross-Modal Knowledge Mining (CMC-CMKM). This framework exploits modality-specific knowledge in order to mitigate the limitations of typical self-supervised frameworks. The extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate that the suggested framework significantly outperforms contrastive unimodal and multimodal baselines on different scenarios, including fully-supervised fine-tuning, activity retrieval and semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, it shows performance competitive even compared to supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in IEEE WCCI 2022 (IJCNN 2022 track)</p></details> | None |

Recent neural approaches automate individual components but the corresponding latent representations cannot provide artists with explicit controls as in conventional tools. In this paper, we present a new learning-based, video-driven approach for generating dynamic facial geometries with high-quality physically-based assets. For data collection, we construct a hybrid multiview-photometric capture stage, coupling with ultra-fast video cameras to obtain raw 3D facial assets. We then set out to model the facial expression, geometry and physically-based textures using separate VAEs where we impose a global MLP based expression mapping across the latent spaces of respective networks, to preserve characteristics across respective attributes. We also model the delta information as wrinkle maps for the physically-based textures, achieving high-quality 4K dynamic textures. We demonstrate our approach in high-fidelity performer-specific facial capture and cross-identity facial motion retargeting. In addition, our multi-VAE-based neural asset, along with the fast adaptation schemes, can also be deployed to handle in-the-wild videos. Besides, we motivate the utility of our explicit facial disentangling strategy by providing various promising physically-based editing results with high realism. Comprehensive experiments show that our technique provides higher accuracy and visual fidelity than previous video-driven facial reconstruction and animation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>For p...</summary><p>For project page, see https://sites.google.com/view/npfa/ Notice: You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, display, perform, modify, create derivative works, transmit, or in any way exploit any such content, nor may you distribute any part of this content over any network, including a local area network, sell or offer it for sale, or use such content to construct any kind of database</p></details> | None |

However, interactive multimedia applications (e.g., ultra high definition video conferencing, 3D and multiview video streaming, crowd-sourced video streaming, cloud gaming, virtual and augmented reality) are becoming more ambitious with high volume and low latency video streams putting strict demands on the already congested networks. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm that extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network i.e., at the base station level. To meet the latency requirements and avoid the end-to-end communication with remote cloud data centers, MEC allows to store and process video content (e.g., caching, transcoding, pre-processing) at the base stations. Both video on demand and live video streaming can utilize MEC to improve existing services and develop novel use cases, such as video analytics, and targeted advertisements. MEC is expected to reshape the future of video streaming by providing ultra-reliable and low latency streaming (e.g., in augmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles), pervasive computing (e.g., in real-time video analytics), and blockchain-enabled architecture for secure live streaming. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent developments in MEC-enabled video streaming bringing unprecedented improvement to enable novel use cases. A detailed review of the state-of-the-art is presented covering novel caching schemes, optimal computation offloading, cooperative caching and offloading and the use of artificial intelligence (i.e., machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning) in MEC-assisted video streaming services.</p></details> | 36 pages | None |
| **[Adaptively-weighted Integral Space for Fast Multiview Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12808v1)** | 2022-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiview clustering has been extensively studied to take advantage of multi-source information to improve the clustering performance. In general, most of the existing works typically compute an n * n affinity graph by some similarity/distance metrics (e.g. the Euclidean distance) or learned representations, and explore the pairwise correlations across views. But unfortunately, a quadratic or even cubic complexity is often needed, bringing about difficulty in clustering largescale datasets. Some efforts have been made recently to capture data distribution in multiple views by selecting view-wise anchor representations with k-means, or by direct matrix factorization on the original observations. Despite the significant success, few of them have considered the view-insufficiency issue, implicitly holding the assumption that each individual view is sufficient to recover the cluster structure. Moreover, the latent integral space as well as the shared cluster structure from multiple insufficient views is not able to be simultaneously discovered. In view of this, we propose an Adaptively-weighted Integral Space for Fast Multiview Clustering (AIMC) with nearly linear complexity. Specifically, view generation models are designed to reconstruct the view observations from the latent integral space with diverse adaptive contributions. Meanwhile, a centroid representation with orthogonality constraint and cluster partition are seamlessly constructed to approximate the latent integral space. An alternate minimizing algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem, which is proved to have linear time complexity w.r.t. the sample size. Extensive experiments conducted on several realworld datasets confirm the superiority of the proposed AIMC method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Contrastive learning approaches have shown promising performance in this task. However, they neglect the semantic consistency between fused and view representations and have difficulty in modeling complementary information between different views. To deal with these deficiencies, this work presents a novel Contrastive leaRning framEwork for Multiview network Embedding (CREME). In our work, different views can be obtained based on the various relations among nodes. Then, we generate view embeddings via proper view encoders and utilize an attentive multiview aggregator to fuse these representations. Particularly, we design two collaborative contrastive objectives, view fusion InfoMax and inter-view InfoMin, to train the model in a self-supervised manner. The former objective distills information from embeddings generated from different views, while the latter captures complementary information among views to promote distinctive view embeddings. We also show that the two objectives can be unified into one objective for model training.

| **[Multiview Regenerative Morphing with Dual Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01287v1)** | 2022-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to address a new task of image morphing under a multiview setting, which takes two sets of multiview images as the input and generates intermediate renderings that not only exhibit smooth transitions between the two input sets but also ensure visual consistency across different views at any transition state. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach called Multiview Regenerative Morphing that formulates the morphing process as an optimization to solve for rigid transformation and optimal-transport interpolation. Given the multiview input images of the source and target scenes, we first learn a volumetric representation that models the geometry and appearance for each scene to enable the rendering of novel views. Then, the morphing between the two scenes is obtained by solving optimal transport between the two volumetric representations in Wasserstein metrics. Our approach does not rely on user-specified correspondences or 2D/3D input meshes, and we do not assume any predefined categories of the source and target scenes. The proposed view-consistent interpolation scheme directly works on multiview images to yield a novel and visually plausible effect of multiview free-form morphing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Active Domain-Invariant Self-Localization Using Ego-Centric and World-Centric Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10497v2)** | 2022-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training of a next-best-view (NBV) planner for visual place recognition (VPR) is a fundamentally important task in autonomous robot navigation, for which a typical approach is the use of visual experiences that are collected in the target domain as training data. However, the collection of a wide variety of visual experiences in everyday navigation is costly and prohibitive for real-time robotic applications. We address this issue by employing a novel {\it domain-invariant} NBV planner. A standard VPR subsystem based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is assumed to be available, and its domain-invariant state recognition ability is proposed to be transferred to train the domain-invariant NBV planner. Specifically, we divide the visual cues that are available from the CNN model into two types: the output layer cue (OLC) and intermediate layer cue (ILC). The OLC is available at the output layer of the CNN model and aims to estimate the state of the robot (e.g., the robot viewpoint) with respect to the world-centric view coordinate system. The ILC is available within the middle layers of the CNN model as a high-level description of the visual content (e.g., a saliency image) with respect to the ego-centric view. In our framework, the ILC and OLC are mapped to a state vector and subsequently used to train a multiview NBV planner via deep reinforcement learning. Experiments using the public NCLT dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, draft version of a manuscript submitted to CVMI2022</p></details> | None |
| **[MPS-NeRF: Generalizable 3D Human Rendering from Multiview Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16875v2)** | 2022-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been rapid progress recently on 3D human rendering, including novel view synthesis and pose animation, based on the advances of neural radiance fields (NeRF). However, most existing methods focus on person-specific training and their training typically requires multi-view videos. This paper deals with a new challenging task -- rendering novel views and novel poses for a person unseen in training, using only multiview images as input. For this task, we propose a simple yet effective method to train a generalizable NeRF with multiview images as conditional input. The key ingredient is a dedicated representation combining a canonical NeRF and a volume deformation scheme. Using a canonical space enables our method to learn shared properties of human and easily generalize to different people. Volume deformation is used to connect the canonical space with input and target images and query image features for radiance and density prediction. We leverage the parametric 3D human model fitted on the input images to derive the deformation, which works quite well in practice when combined with our canonical NeRF. The experiments on both real and synthetic data with the novel view synthesis and pose animation tasks collectively demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

Solutions involving depth cameras are limited in range and to indoor spaces, and dense reconstruction systems based on minimising the photometric error between frames are typically poorly constrained and suffer from scale ambiguity. To address these issues, we propose a 3D reconstruction system that leverages the output of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce fully dense depth maps for keyframes that include metric scale. Our system, DeepFusion, is capable of producing real-time dense reconstructions on a GPU. It fuses the output of a semi-dense multiview stereo algorithm with the depth and gradient predictions of a CNN in a probabilistic fashion, using learned uncertainties produced by the network. While the network only needs to be run once per keyframe, we are able to optimise for the depth map with each new frame so as to constantly make use of new geometric constraints. Based on its performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DeepFusion is capable of performing at least as well as other comparable systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2019</p></details> | None |

Surprisingly, an extension of these methods to the multiview domain is relatively unexplored. A successful multiview policy could be deployed on a mobile manipulation platform, allowing the robot to complete a task regardless of its view of the scene. In this work, we demonstrate that a multiview policy can be found through imitation learning by collecting data from a variety of viewpoints. We illustrate the general applicability of the method by learning to complete several challenging multi-stage and contact-rich tasks, from numerous viewpoints, both in a simulated environment and on a real mobile manipulation platform. Furthermore, we analyze our policies to determine the benefits of learning from multiview data compared to learning with data collected from a fixed perspective. We show that learning from multiview data results in little, if any, penalty to performance for a fixed-view task compared to learning with an equivalent amount of fixed-view data. Finally, we examine the visual features learned by the multiview and fixed-view policies. Our results indicate that multiview policies implicitly learn to identify spatially correlated features.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'21), Prague, Czech Republic, Sep. 27 - Oct. 1, 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[An Embedding-Dynamic Approach to Self-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03552v1)** | 2022-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A number of recent self-supervised learning methods have shown impressive performance on image classification and other tasks. A somewhat bewildering variety of techniques have been used, not always with a clear understanding of the reasons for their benefits, especially when used in combination. Here we treat the embeddings of images as point particles and consider model optimization as a dynamic process on this system of particles. Our dynamic model combines an attractive force for similar images, a locally dispersive force to avoid local collapse, and a global dispersive force to achieve a globally-homogeneous distribution of particles. The dynamic perspective highlights the advantage of using a delayed-parameter image embedding (a la BYOL) together with multiple views of the same image. It also uses a purely-dynamic local dispersive force (Brownian motion) that shows improved performance over other methods and does not require knowledge of other particle coordinates. The method is called MSBReg which stands for (i) a Multiview centroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull different image view embeddings toward their centroid, (ii) a Singular value loss, which pushes the particle system toward spatially homogeneous density, (iii) a Brownian diffusive loss. We evaluate downstream classification performance of MSBReg on ImageNet as well as transfer learning tasks including fine-grained classification, multi-class object classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. In addition, we also show that applying our regularization term to other methods further improves their performance and stabilize the training by preventing a mode collapse.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 3 figures, submitted to CVPR 2022</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive Multi-view and Temporal Fusing Transformer for 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05092v2)** | 2022-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a unified framework dubbed Multi-view and Temporal Fusing Transformer (MTF-Transformer) to adaptively handle varying view numbers and video length without camera calibration in 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). It consists of Feature Extractor, Multi-view Fusing Transformer (MFT), and Temporal Fusing Transformer (TFT). Feature Extractor estimates 2D pose from each image and fuses the prediction according to the confidence. It provides pose-focused feature embedding and makes subsequent modules computationally lightweight. MFT fuses the features of a varying number of views with a novel Relative-Attention block. It adaptively measures the implicit relative relationship between each pair of views and reconstructs more informative features. TFT aggregates the features of the whole sequence and predicts 3D pose via a transformer. It adaptively deals with the video of arbitrary length and fully unitizes the temporal information. The migration of transformers enables our model to learn spatial geometry better and preserve robustness for varying application scenarios. We report quantitative and qualitative results on the Human3.6M, TotalCapture, and KTH Multiview Football II. Compared with state-of-the-art methods with camera parameters, MTF-Transformer obtains competitive results and generalizes well to dynamic capture with an arbitrary number of unseen views.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Capturing and Inferring Dense Full-Body Human-Scene Contact](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09553v1)** | 2022-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring human-scene contact (HSC) is the first step toward understanding how humans interact with their surroundings. While detecting 2D human-object interaction (HOI) and reconstructing 3D human pose and shape (HPS) have enjoyed significant progress, reasoning about 3D human-scene contact from a single image is still challenging. Existing HSC detection methods consider only a few types of predefined contact, often reduce body and scene to a small number of primitives, and even overlook image evidence. To predict human-scene contact from a single image, we address the limitations above from both data and algorithmic perspectives. We capture a new dataset called RICH for "Real scenes, Interaction, Contact and Humans." RICH contains multiview outdoor/indoor video sequences at 4K resolution, ground-truth 3D human bodies captured using markerless motion capture, 3D body scans, and high resolution 3D scene scans. A key feature of RICH is that it also contains accurate vertex-level contact labels on the body. Using RICH, we train a network that predicts dense body-scene contacts from a single RGB image. Our key insight is that regions in contact are always occluded so the network needs the ability to explore the whole image for evidence. We use a transformer to learn such non-local relationships and propose a new Body-Scene contact TRansfOrmer (BSTRO). Very few methods explore 3D contact; those that do focus on the feet only, detect foot contact as a post-processing step, or infer contact from body pose without looking at the scene. To our knowledge, BSTRO is the first method to directly estimate 3D body-scene contact from a single image. We demonstrate that BSTRO significantly outperforms the prior art. The code and dataset are available at https://rich.is.tue.mpg.de.</p></details> | CVPR 2022 | None |
| **[Physics Informed Neural Fields for Smoke Reconstruction with Sparse Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06577v1)** | 2022-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity reconstruction of fluids from sparse multiview RGB videos remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the underlying physics as well as complex occlusion and lighting in captures. Existing solutions either assume knowledge of obstacles and lighting, or only focus on simple fluid scenes without obstacles or complex lighting, and thus are unsuitable for real-world scenes with unknown lighting or arbitrary obstacles. We present the first method to reconstruct dynamic fluid by leveraging the governing physics (ie, Navier -Stokes equations) in an end-to-end optimization from sparse videos without taking lighting conditions, geometry information, or boundary conditions as input. We provide a continuous spatio-temporal scene representation using neural networks as the ansatz of density and velocity solution functions for fluids as well as the radiance field for static objects. With a hybrid architecture that separates static and dynamic contents, fluid interactions with static obstacles are reconstructed for the first time without additional geometry input or human labeling. By augmenting time-varying neural radiance fields with physics-informed deep learning, our method benefits from the supervision of images and physical priors. To achieve robust optimization from sparse views, we introduced a layer-by-layer growing strategy to progressively increase the network capacity. Using progressively growing models with a new regularization term, we manage to disentangle density-color ambiguity in radiance fields without overfitting. A pretrained density-to-velocity fluid model is leveraged in addition as the data prior to avoid suboptimal velocity which underestimates vorticity but trivially fulfills physical equations. Our method exhibits high-quality results with relaxed constraints and strong flexibility on a representative set of synthetic and real flow captures.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to ACM Transactions On Graphics (SIGGRAPH 2022), further info:\url{https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mchu/projects/PI-NeRF/}</p></details> | None |

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a de facto model for analyzing graph-structured data. However, how to employ GNNs to extract effective representations from brain networks in multiple modalities remains rarely explored. Moreover, as brain networks provide no initial node features, how to design informative node attributes and leverage edge weights for GNNs to learn is left unsolved. To this end, we develop a novel multiview GNN for multimodal brain networks. In particular, we regard each modality as a view for brain networks and employ contrastive learning for multimodal fusion. Then, we propose a GNN model which takes advantage of the message passing scheme by propagating messages based on degree statistics and brain region connectivities. Extensive experiments on two real-world disease datasets (HIV and Bipolar) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forma...</summary><p>Formal version accepted to IEEE EMBC 2022; previously presented at ICML 2021 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Mental Health (no proceedings)</p></details> | None |
| **[Panoptic Neural Fields: A Semantic Object-Aware Neural Scene Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04334v1)** | 2022-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Panoptic Neural Fields (PNF), an object-aware neural scene representation that decomposes a scene into a set of objects (things) and background (stuff). Each object is represented by an oriented 3D bounding box and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes position, direction, and time and outputs density and radiance. The background stuff is represented by a similar MLP that additionally outputs semantic labels. Each object MLPs are instance-specific and thus can be smaller and faster than previous object-aware approaches, while still leveraging category-specific priors incorporated via meta-learned initialization. Our model builds a panoptic radiance field representation of any scene from just color images. We use off-the-shelf algorithms to predict camera poses, object tracks, and 2D image semantic segmentations. Then we jointly optimize the MLP weights and bounding box parameters using analysis-by-synthesis with self-supervision from color images and pseudo-supervision from predicted semantic segmentations. During experiments with real-world dynamic scenes, we find that our model can be used effectively for several tasks like novel view synthesis, 2D panoptic segmentation, 3D scene editing, and multiview depth prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2022 paper.

Our approach takes the high quality and compactness of static neural radiance fields in a new direction: to a model-free, dynamic setting. At the core of our approach is a novel time-conditioned neural radiance field that represents scene dynamics using a set of compact latent codes. We are able to significantly boost the training speed and perceptual quality of the generated imagery by a novel hierarchical training scheme in combination with ray importance sampling. Our learned representation is highly compact and able to represent a 10 second 30 FPS multiview video recording by 18 cameras with a model size of only 28MB. We demonstrate that our method can render high-fidelity wide-angle novel views at over 1K resolution, even for complex and dynamic scenes. We perform an extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation that shows that our approach outperforms the state of the art.

| **[Understanding Latent Correlation-Based Multiview Learning and Self-Supervision: An Identifiability Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07115v3)** | 2022-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple views of data, both naturally acquired (e.g., image and audio) and artificially produced (e.g., via adding different noise to data samples), have proven useful in enhancing representation learning. Natural views are often handled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation analysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., BYOL and Barlow Twins. Both types of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that the embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although intuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is mostly empirically validated. This work aims to understand latent correlation maximization-based deep multiview learning from a latent component identification viewpoint. An intuitive generative model of multiview data is adopted, where the views are different nonlinear mixtures of shared and private components. Since the shared components are view/distortion-invariant, representing the data using such components is believed to reveal the identity of the samples effectively and robustly. Under this model, latent correlation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared components across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, it is further shown that the private information in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using proper regularization design. A finite sample analysis, which has been rare in nonlinear mixture identifiability study, is also presented. The theoretical results and newly designed regularization are tested on a series of tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2022 Spotlight, 37 pages, 11 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Generative Models as a Data Source for Multiview Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05258v3)** | 2022-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models are now capable of producing highly realistic images that look nearly indistinguishable from the data on which they are trained. This raises the question: if we have good enough generative models, do we still need datasets? We investigate this question in the setting of learning general-purpose visual representations from a black-box generative model rather than directly from data. Given an off-the-shelf image generator without any access to its training data, we train representations from the samples output by this generator. We compare several representation learning methods that can be applied to this setting, using the latent space of the generator to generate multiple "views" of the same semantic content. We show that for contrastive methods, this multiview data can naturally be used to identify positive pairs (nearby in latent space) and negative pairs (far apart in latent space). We find that the resulting representations rival or even outperform those learned directly from real data, but that good performance requires care in the sampling strategy applied and the training method. Generative models can be viewed as a compressed and organized copy of a dataset, and we envision a future where more and more "model zoos" proliferate while datasets become increasingly unwieldy, missing, or private. This paper suggests several techniques for dealing with visual representation learning in such a future. Code is available on our project page https://ali-design.github.io/GenRep/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://ali-design.github.io/GenRep) |

Face clustering for long-form content is challenging because of variations in appearance and lack of supporting large-scale labeled data. Our work in this paper focuses on two key aspects of this problem: the lack of domain-specific training or benchmark datasets, and adapting face embeddings learned on web images to long-form content, specifically movies. First, we present a dataset of over 169,000 face tracks curated from 240 Hollywood movies with weak labels on whether a pair of face tracks belong to the same or a different character. We propose an offline algorithm based on nearest-neighbor search in the embedding space to mine hard-examples from these tracks. We then investigate triplet-loss and multiview correlation-based methods for adapting face embeddings to hard-examples. Our experimental results highlight the usefulness of weakly labeled data for domain-specific feature adaptation. Overall, we find that multiview correlation-based adaptation yields more discriminative and robust face embeddings. Its performance on downstream face verification and clustering tasks is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art results in this domain. We also present the SAIL-Movie Character Benchmark corpus developed to augment existing benchmarks. It consists of racially diverse actors and provides face-quality labels for subsequent error analysis. We hope that the large-scale datasets developed in this work can further advance automatic character labeling in videos.

More specifically, we extract discharge summaries of patients from their EHRs, and represent them with multiview graphs enhanced by an external knowledge graph. Graph convolutional networks are then used for representation learning. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our method, yielding state-of-the-art performance for this task.</p></details> | SIGIR 2021 | None |

Traditional subspace clustering methods, such as sparse subspace clustering (SSC) and low-ranking subspace clustering (LRSC), cluster the affinity matrix for a single view, thus ignoring the problem of fusion between views. In our article, we propose a new Multiview Subspace Adaptive Learning based on Attention and Autoencoder (MSALAA). This method combines a deep autoencoder and a method for aligning the self-representations of various views in Multi-view Low-Rank Sparse Subspace Clustering (MLRSSC), which can not only increase the capability to non-linearity fitting, but also can meets the principles of consistency and complementarity of multi-view learning.

However, all of them failed to consider the difficulty labels (uncertainty of ground-truth for training samples) over multi-view samples, which may result into a nonideal clustering network for getting stuck into poor local optima during training process; worse still, the difficulty labels from multi-view samples are always inconsistent, such fact makes it even more challenging to handle. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Adversarial Inconsistent Cognitive Sampling (DAICS) method for multi-view progressive subspace clustering. A multiview binary classification (easy or difficult) loss and a feature similarity loss are proposed to jointly learn a binary classifier and a deep consistent feature embedding network, throughout an adversarial minimax game over difficulty labels of multiview consistent samples. We develop a multi-view cognitive sampling strategy to select the input samples from easy to difficult for multi-view clustering network training. However, the distributions of easy and difficult samples are mixed together, hence not trivial to achieve the goal. To resolve it, we define a sampling probability with theoretical guarantee. Based on that, a golden section mechanism is further designed to generate a sample set boundary to progressively select the samples with varied difficulty labels via a gate unit, which is utilized to jointly learn a multi-view common progressive subspace and clustering network for more efficient clustering. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DAICS over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
