However, the features they learn often blend content and style information, which somewhat limits their generalization capabilities under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we adopt a causal generative perspective for multimodal data and propose contrastive learning with data augmentation to disentangle content features from the original representations. To achieve this, we begin by exploring image augmentation techniques and develop a method to seamlessly integrate them into pre-trained CLIP-like models to extract pure content features. Taking a step further, and recognizing the inherent semantic richness and logical structure of text data, we explore the use of text augmentation to isolate latent content from style features. This enables CLIP-like models' encoders to concentrate on latent content information, refining the representations learned by pre-trained CLIP-like models. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks, alongside enhanced robustness to various perturbations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed methods in refining vision-language representations and advancing the state of the art in multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |

However, clinical diagnosis in the real world often requires integrating domain knowledge, especially textual information. Conducting multimodal learning involves visual and text modalities shown as a solution, but collecting paired vision-language datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing significant challenges. Inspired by the superior ability in numerous cross-modal tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we proposed a novel Vision-LLM union framework to address the issues. Specifically, we introduce frozen LLMs for zero-shot instruction generation based on corresponding medical images, imitating the radiology scanning and report generation process. {To better approximate real-world diagnostic processes}, we generate more precise text instruction from multimodal radiology images (e.g., T1-w or T2-w MRI and CT). Based on the impressive ability of semantic understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. This process emphasizes extracting special features from different modalities and reunion the information for the ultimate clinical diagnostic. With generated text instruction, our proposed union segmentation framework can handle multimodal segmentation without prior collected vision-language datasets. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments with influential baselines, the statistical results and the visualized case study demonstrate the superiority of our novel method.}</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, In Press by a journal</p></details> | None |
| **[FetalCLIP: A Visual-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14807v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Resource-Efficient Beam Prediction in mmWave Communications with Multimodal Realistic Simulation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05187v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beamforming is a key technology in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications that improves signal transmission by optimizing directionality and intensity. However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a resource-efficient learning approach is proposed to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a monomodal (radar-only) network based on cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD), while reducing computational overhead and preserving predictive accuracy. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62\%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10\%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications on Apr. 07, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[FluentLip: A Phonemes-Based Two-stage Approach for Audio-Driven Lip Synthesis with Optical Flow Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04427v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating consecutive images of lip movements that align with a given speech in audio-driven lip synthesis is a challenging task. While previous studies have made strides in synchronization and visual quality, lip intelligibility and video fluency remain persistent challenges. This work proposes FluentLip, a two-stage approach for audio-driven lip synthesis, incorporating three featured strategies. To improve lip synchronization and intelligibility, we integrate a phoneme extractor and encoder to generate a fusion of audio and phoneme information for multimodal learning. Additionally, we employ optical flow consistency loss to ensure natural transitions between image frames. Furthermore, we incorporate a diffusion chain during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve both stability and efficiency. We evaluate our proposed FluentLip through extensive experiments, comparing it with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across five metrics, including a proposed metric called Phoneme Error Rate (PER) that evaluates lip pose intelligibility and video fluency. The experimental results demonstrate that our FluentLip approach is highly competitive, achieving significant improvements in smoothness and naturalness. In particular, it outperforms these SOTA approaches by approximately $\textbf{16.3%}$ in Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and $\textbf{35.2%}$ in PER.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Tumor Protein-Metal Binding: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03847v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern drug pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional end-to-end or reinforcement learning approaches, our method processes image sequences with pre-trained models and robot state data with machine learning algorithms, fusing their outputs to predict continuous action values for control. Evaluated on BridgeData V2 and Kuka datasets, the best configuration (VGG16 + Random Forest) achieved MSEs of 0.0021 and 0.0028, respectively, demonstrating strong predictive performance and robustness. The framework supports modularity, interpretability, and real-time decision-making, aligning with the goals of adaptive, human-in-the-loop cyber-physical systems.</p></details> | 7 pages , 4 figures | None |
| **[Unimodal-driven Distillation in Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Dynamic Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23721v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (MERC) identifies emotional states across text, audio and video, which is essential for intelligent dialogue systems and opinion analysis. Existing methods emphasize heterogeneous modal fusion directly for cross-modal integration, but often suffer from disorientation in multimodal learning due to modal heterogeneity and lack of instructive guidance. In this work, we propose SUMMER, a novel heterogeneous multimodal integration framework leveraging Mixture of Experts with Hierarchical Cross-modal Fusion and Interactive Knowledge Distillation. Key components include a Sparse Dynamic Mixture of Experts (SDMoE) for capturing dynamic token-wise interactions, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion (HCMF) for effective fusion of heterogeneous modalities, and Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IKD), which uses a pre-trained unimodal teacher to guide multimodal fusion in latent and logit spaces. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show SUMMER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in recognizing minority and semantically similar emotions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MMIE: Massive Multimodal Interleaved Comprehension Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10139v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Oral | [Code Link](https://mmie-bench.github.io/) |
| **[RGB-Th-Bench: A Dense benchmark for Visual-Thermal Understanding of Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19654v3)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RGB-Th-Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to comprehend RGB-Thermal image pairs. While VLMs have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual reasoning and multimodal understanding, their evaluation has been predominantly limited to RGB-based benchmarks, leaving a critical gap in assessing their capabilities in infrared vision tasks. Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding. The dataset is available through this link, and the evaluation code will also be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

| **[Multimodal Learning with Uncertainty Quantification based on Discounted Belief Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18024v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal AI models are increasingly used in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where information is drawn from multiple sources or modalities such as images, texts, audios, videos. However, effectively managing uncertainty - arising from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities - is crucial for reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models in uncertainty-based conflict detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Graph-to-Vision: Multi-graph Understanding and Reasoning using Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21435v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as the dominant paradigm for graph-structured learning, have long faced dual challenges of exponentially escalating computational complexity and inadequate cross-scenario generalization capability. With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional cross-modal relational reasoning capabilities and generalization capacities, thereby opening up novel pathways for overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional graph learning paradigms. However, current research predominantly concentrates on investigating the single-graph reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which fundamentally fails to address the critical requirement for coordinated reasoning across multiple heterogeneous graph data in real-world application scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose the first multi-graph joint reasoning benchmark for VLMs. Our benchmark encompasses four graph categories: knowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps,with each graph group accompanied by three progressively challenging instruction-response pairs. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted comprehensive capability assessments of state-of-the-art VLMs and performed fine-tuning on open-source models. This study not only addresses the underexplored evaluation gap in multi-graph reasoning for VLMs but also empirically validates their generalization superiority in graph-structured learning.</p></details> |  | None |

UGen converts both texts and images into discrete token sequences and utilizes a single transformer to generate them uniformly in an autoregressive manner. To address the challenges associated with unified multimodal learning, UGen is trained using a novel mechanism, namely progressive vocabulary learning. In this process, visual token IDs are incrementally activated and integrated into the training phase, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of unified multimodal learning. Experiments on comprehensive text and image tasks show that UGen achieves a significant overall performance improvement of 13.3% compared to the vanilla unified autoregressive method, and it also delivers competitive results across all tasks against several task-specific models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AdaMHF: Adaptive Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion for Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21124v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of pathologic images and genomic data for survival analysis has gained increasing attention with advances in multimodal learning. However, current methods often ignore biological characteristics, such as heterogeneity and sparsity, both within and across modalities, ultimately limiting their adaptability to clinical practice. To address these challenges, we propose AdaMHF: Adaptive Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion, a framework designed for efficient, comprehensive, and tailored feature extraction and fusion. AdaMHF is specifically adapted to the uniqueness of medical data, enabling accurate predictions with minimal resource consumption, even under challenging scenarios with missing modalities. Initially, AdaMHF employs an experts expansion and residual structure to activate specialized experts for extracting heterogeneous and sparse features. Extracted tokens undergo refinement via selection and aggregation, reducing the weight of non-dominant features while preserving comprehensive information. Subsequently, the encoded features are hierarchically fused, allowing multi-grained interactions across modalities to be captured. Furthermore, we introduce a survival prediction benchmark designed to resolve scenarios with missing modalities, mirroring real-world clinical conditions. Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets demonstrate that AdaMHF surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, showcasing exceptional performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22715v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis has emerged as a critical tool for understanding human emotions across diverse communication channels. While existing methods have made significant strides, they often struggle to effectively differentiate and integrate modality-shared and modality-specific information, limiting the performance of multimodal learning. To address this challenge, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (HAEMSA), a novel framework that synergistically combines evolutionary optimization, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and multi-task learning. HAEMSA employs a hierarchical structure of adaptive experts to capture both global and local modality representations, enabling more nuanced sentiment analysis. Our approach leverages evolutionary algorithms to dynamically optimize network architectures and modality combinations, adapting to both partial and full modality scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate HAEMSA's superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. On CMU-MOSEI, HAEMSA achieves a 2.6% increase in 7-class accuracy and a 0.059 decrease in MAE compared to the previous best method. For CMU-MOSI, we observe a 6.3% improvement in 7-class accuracy and a 0.058 reduction in MAE. On IEMOCAP, HAEMSA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.84% in weighted-F1 score for emotion recognition. These results underscore HAEMSA's effectiveness in capturing complex multimodal interactions and generalizing across different emotional contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[LRSCLIP: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Aligning Remote Sensing Image with Longer Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19311v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the technical bottlenecks in handling long text and the "hallucination" issue caused by insufficient short text information in remote sensing vision-language foundation models (VLFM). We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP. This work provides a new benchmark model and data support for remote sensing multimodal learning.

| **[Adaptive Unimodal Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18595v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensory training during the early ages is vital for human development. Inspired by this cognitive phenomenon, we observe that the early training stage is also important for the multimodal learning process, where dataset information is rapidly acquired. We refer to this stage as the prime learning window. However, based on our observation, this prime learning window in multimodal learning is often dominated by information-sufficient modalities, which in turn suppresses the information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. To address this issue, we propose Information Acquisition Regulation (InfoReg), a method designed to balance information acquisition among modalities. Specifically, InfoReg slows down the information acquisition process of information-sufficient modalities during the prime learning window, which could promote information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. This regulation enables a more balanced learning process and improves the overall performance of the multimodal network. Experiments show that InfoReg outperforms related multimodal imbalanced methods across various datasets, achieving superior model performance.

| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MTBench: A Multimodal Time Series Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning and Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16858v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between textual news and time-series evolution is a critical yet under-explored challenge in applied data science. While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

However, traditional mapping methods are labor-intensive, limiting spatial coverage and introducing potential biases. To address these limitations, we introduce EarthScape, a novel, AI-ready multimodal dataset specifically designed for surficial geologic mapping and Earth surface analysis. EarthScape integrates high-resolution aerial RGB and near-infrared (NIR) imagery, digital elevation models (DEM), multi-scale DEM-derived terrain features, and hydrologic and infrastructure vector data. The dataset provides detailed annotations for seven distinct surficial geologic classes encompassing various geological processes. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline using open-sourced raw data and establish baseline benchmarks using different spatial modalities to demonstrate the utility of EarthScape. As a living dataset with a vision for expansion, EarthScape bridges the gap between computer vision and Earth sciences, offering a valuable resource for advancing research in multimodal learning, geospatial analysis, and geological mapping.

| **[Optimal Transport Adapter Tuning for Bridging Modality Gaps in Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14938v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification (FS-RSSC) presents the challenge of classifying remote sensing images with limited labeled samples. Existing methods typically emphasize single-modal feature learning, neglecting the potential benefits of optimizing multi-modal representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Optimal Transport Adapter Tuning (OTAT) framework aimed at constructing an ideal Platonic representational space through optimal transport (OT) theory. This framework seeks to harmonize rich visual information with less dense textual cues, enabling effective cross-modal information transfer and complementarity. Central to this approach is the Optimal Transport Adapter (OTA), which employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to enrich textual representations and facilitate subsequent better information interaction. By transforming the network optimization into an OT optimization problem, OTA establishes efficient pathways for balanced information exchange between modalities. Moreover, we introduce a sample-level Entropy-Aware Weighted (EAW) loss, which combines difficulty-weighted similarity scores with entropy-based regularization. This loss function provides finer control over the OT optimization process, enhancing its solvability and stability. Our framework offers a scalable and efficient solution for advancing multimodal learning in remote sensing applications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that OTAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in FS-RSSC, significantly improving the model performance and generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Do Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Welding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16537v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the performance of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in skilled production work, with a focus on welding. Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV \& Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others. These results underscore the limitations and potentials of MLLMs in high-stakes technical domains and highlight the importance of fine-tuning, domain-specific data, and more sophisticated prompting strategies to improve model reliability. The study opens avenues for further research into multimodal learning in industry applications.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

However, existing methods face key limitations: 1) They rely on multimodal mapping and metrics in Euclidean space, which cannot fully capture the hierarchical structures in histopathology (among patches from different resolutions) and genomics data (from genes to pathways). 2) They discretize survival time into independent risk intervals, which ignores its continuous and ordinal nature and fails to achieve effective optimization. 3) They treat censorship as a binary indicator, excluding censored samples from model optimization and not making full use of them. To address these challenges, we propose HySurvPred, a novel framework for survival prediction that integrates three key modules: Multimodal Hyperbolic Mapping (MHM), Angle-aware Ranking-based Contrastive Loss (ARCL) and Censor-Conditioned Uncertainty Constraint (CUC). Instead of relying on Euclidean space, we design the MHM module to explore the inherent hierarchical structures within each modality in hyperbolic space. To better integrate multimodal features in hyperbolic space, we introduce the ARCL module, which uses ranking-based contrastive learning to preserve the ordinal nature of survival time, along with the CUC module to fully explore the censored data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. The source code is to be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IJCAI2025</p></details> | None |

However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

While this approach reduces computational overhead and model complexity, it often requires large amounts of training data to effectively capture the visual knowledge typically encoded by vision models like CLIP. The absence of a vision encoder implies that the model is likely to rely on substantial data to learn the necessary visual-semantic alignments. In this work, we present BREEN, a data-efficient encoder-free multimodal architecture that mitigates this issue. BREEN leverages a learnable query and image experts to achieve comparable performance with significantly less training data. The learnable query, positioned between image and text tokens, is supervised by the output of a pretrained CLIP model to distill visual knowledge, bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities. Additionally, the image expert processes image tokens and learnable queries independently, improving efficiency and reducing interference with the LLM's textual capabilities. BREEN achieves comparable performance to prior encoder-free state-of-the-art models like Mono-InternVL, using only 13 million text-image pairs in training about one percent of the data required by existing methods. Our work highlights a promising direction for data-efficient encoder-free multimodal learning, offering an alternative to traditional encoder-based approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the potential of multimodal collaboration remains under-exploited due to disparities in data quality and modality representation capabilities. To address this, we introduce DynCIM, a novel dynamic curriculum learning framework designed to quantify the inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives. DynCIM employs a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing fusion effectiveness. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarking datasets, spanning both bimodal and trimodal scenarios, demonstrate that DynCIM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach effectively mitigates modality and sample imbalances while enhancing adaptability and robustness in multimodal learning tasks.

Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, FL faces significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous data distributions, which can lead to suboptimal global models that fail to generalize across diverse clients. In this work, we propose a novel framework designed to tackle these challenges by introducing a dual-adapter approach. The method utilizes a larger local adapter for client-specific personalization and a smaller global adapter to facilitate efficient knowledge sharing across clients. Additionally, we incorporate a pruning mechanism to reduce communication overhead by selectively removing less impactful parameters from the local adapter. Through extensive experiments on a range of vision and language tasks, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches. It achieves higher test accuracy, lower performance variance among clients, and improved worst-case performance, all while significantly reducing communication and computation costs. Overall, the proposed method addresses the critical trade-off between model personalization and generalization, offering a scalable solution for real-world FL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CCGrid 2025</p></details> | None |

The evolution of multimodal conversational AI, leveraging vast amounts of image-text data from diverse sources, marks a significant stride forward. However, the application of such advanced vision-language models in the agricultural domain, particularly for crop disease diagnosis, remains underexplored. In this work, we present the crop disease domain multimodal (CDDM) dataset, a pioneering resource designed to advance the field of agricultural research through the application of multimodal learning techniques. The dataset comprises 137,000 images of various crop diseases, accompanied by 1 million question-answer pairs that span a broad spectrum of agricultural knowledge, from disease identification to management practices. By integrating visual and textual data, CDDM facilitates the development of sophisticated question-answering systems capable of providing precise, useful advice to farmers and agricultural professionals. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by finetuning state-of-the-art multimodal models, showcasing significant improvements in crop disease diagnosis. Specifically, we employed a novel finetuning strategy that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the visual encoder, adapter and language model simultaneously. Our contributions include not only the dataset but also a finetuning strategy and a benchmark to stimulate further research in agricultural technology, aiming to bridge the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical agricultural applications.

Existing approaches often rely on simple spatiotemporal stacking, which introduces feature redundancy, while subtle joint-level details remain overlooked from a spatial perspective. To this end, we propose a novel HiSTF Mamba framework. The framework is composed of three key modules: Dual-Spatial Mamba, Bi-Temporal Mamba, and Dynamic Spatiotemporal Fusion Module (DSFM). Dual-Spatial Mamba incorporates ``Part-based + Whole-based'' parallel modeling to represent both whole-body coordination and fine-grained joint dynamics. Bi-Temporal Mamba adopts a bidirectional scanning strategy, effectively encoding short-term motion details and long-term dependencies. DSFM further performs redundancy removal and extraction of complementary information for temporal features, then fuses them with spatial features, yielding an expressive spatio-temporal representation. Experimental results on the HumanML3D dataset demonstrate that HiSTF Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. In particular, it reduces the FID score from 0.283 to 0.189, a relative decrease of nearly 30%. These findings validate the effectiveness of HiSTF Mamba in achieving high fidelity and strong semantic alignment in text-to-motion generation.</p></details> | 11pages,3figures, | None |

Because tactile data is often scarce and costly to acquire, generating synthetic tactile images provides a scalable solution to augment real-world measurements. However, ensuring robust generalization in synthesizing tactile images-capturing subtle, material-specific contact features-remains challenging. We demonstrate that overlapping training and test samples in commonly used datasets inflate performance metrics, obscuring the true generalizability of tactile models. To address this, we propose a leakage-free evaluation protocol coupled with novel, reference-free metrics-TMMD, I-TMMD, CI-TMMD, and D-TMMD-tailored for tactile generation. Moreover, we propose a vision-to-touch generation method that leverages text as an intermediate modality by incorporating concise, material-specific descriptions during training to better capture essential tactile features. Experiments on two popular visuo-tactile datasets, Touch and Go and HCT, show that our approach achieves superior performance and enhanced generalization in a leakage-free setting.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality. To efficiently learn the approximation for the missing modality via CMPTs with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning.

Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p></details> | 31 pages 4 figures | None |

Documents are now treated as multimodal entities, incorporating both textual and visual information for downstream analysis. However, works in this space are often focused on the textual aspect, using the visual space as auxiliary information. While some works have explored pure vision based techniques for document image understanding, they require OCR identified text as input during inference, or do not align with text in their learning procedure. Therefore, we present a novel image-text alignment technique specially designed for leveraging the textual information in document images to improve performance on visual tasks. Our document encoder model DoPTA - trained with this technique demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of document image understanding tasks, without requiring OCR during inference. Combined with an auxiliary reconstruction objective, DoPTA consistently outperforms larger models, while using significantly lesser pre-training compute. DoPTA also sets new state-of-the art results on D4LA, and FUNSD, two challenging document visual analysis benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing approaches infer gaze solely from image signals, recent advances in visual-language collaboration have demonstrated that the integration of linguistic information can significantly enhance performance across various visual tasks. Leveraging the remarkable transferability of large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models, we address the open and urgent question of how to effectively apply linguistic cues to gaze estimation. In this work, we propose GazeCLIP, a novel gaze estimation framework that deeply explores text-face collaboration. Specifically, we introduce a meticulously designed linguistic description generator to produce text signals enriched with coarse directional cues. Furthermore, we present a CLIP-based backbone adept at characterizing text-face pairs for gaze estimation, complemented by a fine-grained multimodal fusion module that models the intricate interrelationships between heterogeneous inputs. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of GazeCLIP, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential of using visual-language collaboration to advance gaze estimation and open new avenues for future research in multimodal learning for visual tasks.

However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10pages | None |

When data with a trigger is processed by a backdoor model, it can lead to mispredictions targeted by attackers, whereas normal data yields regular results. The scope of backdoor attacks is expanding beyond computer vision and encroaching into areas such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Nevertheless, existing backdoor defense methods are typically tailored to specific data modalities, restricting their application in multimodal contexts. While multimodal learning proves highly applicable in facial recognition, sentiment analysis, action recognition, visual question answering, the security of these models remains a crucial concern. Specifically, there are no existing backdoor benchmarks targeting multimodal applications or related tasks. In order to facilitate the research in multimodal backdoor, we introduce BackdoorMBTI, the first backdoor learning toolkit and benchmark designed for multimodal evaluation across three representative modalities from eleven commonly used datasets. BackdoorMBTI provides a systematic backdoor learning pipeline, encompassing data processing, data poisoning, backdoor training, and evaluation. The generated poison datasets and backdoor models enable detailed evaluation of backdoor defenses. Given the diversity of modalities, BackdoorMBTI facilitates systematic evaluation across different data types. Furthermore, BackdoorMBTI offers a standardized approach to handling practical factors in backdoor learning, such as issues related to data quality and erroneous labels. We anticipate that BackdoorMBTI will expedite future research in backdoor defense methods within a multimodal context.

Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves state-of-the-art results on the seven multimodal benchmarks.

Most existing multimodal learning approaches heavily rely on training with a large amount of synchronized, complete multimodal data. However, such a setting is impractical in real-world IoT sensing applications where data is typically collected by distributed nodes with heterogeneous data modalities, and is also rarely labeled. In this paper, we propose MMBind, a new data binding approach for multimodal learning on distributed and heterogeneous IoT data. The key idea of MMBind is to construct a pseudo-paired multimodal dataset for model training by binding data from disparate sources and incomplete modalities through a sufficiently descriptive shared modality. We also propose a weighted contrastive learning approach to handle domain shifts among disparate data, coupled with an adaptive multimodal learning architecture capable of training models with heterogeneous modality combinations. Evaluations on ten real-world multimodal datasets highlight that MMBind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying degrees of data incompleteness and domain shift, and holds promise for advancing multimodal foundation model training in IoT applications\footnote (The source code is available via https://github.com/nesl/multimodal-bind).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/nesl/multimodal-bind) |

However, almost all existing methods ignore the modality imbalance caused by unimodal data sampling, i.e., equal unimodal data sampling often results in discrepancies in informational content, leading to modality imbalance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel MML approach called \underline{D}ata-aware \underline{U}nimodal \underline{S}ampling~(\method), which aims to dynamically alleviate the modality imbalance caused by sampling. Specifically, we first propose a novel cumulative modality discrepancy to monitor the multimodal learning process. Based on the learning status, we propose a heuristic and a reinforcement learning~(RL)-based data-aware unimodal sampling approaches to adaptively determine the quantity of sampled data at each iteration, thus alleviating the modality imbalance from the perspective of sampling. Meanwhile, our method can be seamlessly incorporated into almost all existing multimodal learning approaches as a plugin. Experiments demonstrate that \method~can achieve the best performance by comparing with diverse state-of-the-art~(SOTA) baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

While H&E imaging effectively highlights cellular and tissue structures, it lacks sensitivity to birefringence and tissue anisotropy, which are crucial for assessing collagen organization, fiber alignment, and microstructural alterations--key indicators of tumor progression, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose PolarHE, a dual modality fusion framework that integrates H&E with polarization imaging, leveraging the polarization ability to enhance tissue characterization. Our approach employs a feature decomposition strategy to disentangle common and modality specific features, ensuring effective multimodal representation learning. Through comprehensive validation, our approach significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving an accuracy of 86.70% on the Chaoyang dataset and 89.06% on the MHIST dataset. Moreover, polarization property visualization reveals distinct optical signatures of pathological tissues, highlighting its diagnostic potential. t-SNE visualizations further confirm our model effectively captures both shared and unique modality features, reinforcing the complementary nature of polarization imaging. These results demonstrate that polarization imaging is a powerful and underutilized modality in computational pathology, enriching feature representation and improving diagnostic accuracy. PolarHE establishes a promising direction for multimodal learning, paving the way for more interpretable and generalizable pathology models.

Current models rely on structural or target-based features to identify high-efficacy, low-toxicity drug combinations. However, these approaches fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically-relevant predictions. Here, we introduce MADRIGAL, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. MADRIGAL uses a transformer bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference--a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions. MADRIGAL performs virtual screening of anticancer drug combinations and supports polypharmacy management for type II diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It identifies transporter-mediated drug interactions. MADRIGAL predicts resmetirom, the first and only FDA-approved drug for MASH, among therapies with the most favorable safety profile. It supports personalized cancer therapy by integrating genomic profiles from cancer patients. Using primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models, it predicts the efficacy of personalized drug combinations. Integrating MADRIGAL with a large language model allows users to describe clinical outcomes in natural language, improving safety assessment by identifying potential adverse interactions and toxicity risks.

The efficiency of multimodal systems is a critical concern, given the varying costs and resource demands of different modalities. This underscores the necessity for effective modality selection to balance performance gains against resource expenditures. In this study, we propose a novel framework for modality selection that independently learns the representation of each modality. This approach allows for the assessment of each modality's significance within its unique representation space, enabling the development of tailored encoders and facilitating the joint analysis of modalities with distinct characteristics. Our framework aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal learning by optimizing modality integration and selection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dementia Insights: A Context-Based MultiModal Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01226v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dementia, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affects memory, reasoning, and daily functioning, creating challenges for individuals and healthcare systems. Early detection is crucial for timely interventions that may slow disease progression. Large pre-trained models (LPMs) for text and audio, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), have shown promise in identifying cognitive impairments. However, existing studies generally rely heavily on expert-annotated datasets and unimodal approaches, limiting robustness and scalability. This study proposes a context-based multimodal method, integrating both text and audio data using the best-performing LPMs in each modality. By incorporating contextual embeddings, our method improves dementia detection performance. Additionally, motivated by the effectiveness of contextual embeddings, we further experimented with a context-based In-Context Learning (ICL) as a complementary technique. Results show that GPT-based embeddings, particularly when fused with CLAP audio features, achieve an F1-score of $83.33\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art dementia detection models. Furthermore, raw text data outperforms expert-annotated datasets, demonstrating that LPMs can extract meaningful linguistic and acoustic patterns without extensive manual labeling. These findings highlight the potential for scalable, non-invasive diagnostic tools that reduce reliance on costly annotations while maintaining high accuracy. By integrating multimodal learning with contextual embeddings, this work lays the foundation for future advancements in personalized dementia detection and cognitive health research.</p></details> |  | None |

While the existing methods have made strides in gesture accuracy, challenges remain in generating diverse and coherent gestures, as most approaches assume independence among multimodal inputs and lack explicit modeling of their interactions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning method named HOP for co-speech gesture generation that captures the heterogeneous entanglement between gesture motion, audio rhythm, and text semantics, enabling the generation of coordinated gestures. By leveraging spatiotemporal graph modeling, we achieve the alignment of audio and action. Moreover, to enhance modality coherence, we build the audio-text semantic representation based on a reprogramming module, which is beneficial for cross-modality adaptation. Our approach enables the trimodal system to learn each other's features and represent them in the form of topological entanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HOP achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering more natural and expressive co-speech gesture generation.

Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a novel approach for just-in-time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) in autonomous driving software systems using multimodal learning. The proposed model leverages the multimodal transformers in which the pre-trained transformers and a combining module deal with the multiple data modalities of the software system datasets such as code features, change metrics, and contextual information. The key point for adapting multimodal learning is to utilize the attention mechanism between the different data modalities such as text, numerical, and categorical. In the combining module, the output of a transformer model on text data and tabular features containing categorical and numerical data are combined to produce the predictions using the fully connected layers. Experiments conducted on three open-source autonomous driving system software projects collected from the GitHub repository (Apollo, Carla, and Donkeycar) demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models regarding evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning to enhance the reliability and safety of autonomous driving software through improved defect prediction.</p></details> | 9 | None |
| **[Rethinking Multimodal Learning from the Perspective of Mitigating Classification Ability Disproportion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20120v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multimodal learning~(MML) has garnered remarkable progress, the existence of modality imbalance hinders multimodal learning from achieving its expected superiority over unimodal models in practice. To overcome this issue, mainstream multimodal learning methods have placed greater emphasis on balancing the learning process. However, these approaches do not explicitly enhance the classification ability of weaker modalities, leading to limited performance promotion. By designing a sustained boosting algorithm, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities. Concretely, we first propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors using a designed configurable classifier module. Then, we propose an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of weak modality. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on widely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison with various state-of-the-art~(SoTA) multimodal learning baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Completed Feature Disentanglement Learning for Multimodal MRIs Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04916v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal MRIs play a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Feature disentanglement (FD)-based methods, aiming at learning superior feature representations for multimodal data analysis, have achieved significant success in multimodal learning (MML). Typically, existing FD-based methods separate multimodal data into modality-shared and modality-specific features, and employ concatenation or attention mechanisms to integrate these features. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that these methods could lead to a loss of shared information among subsets of modalities when the inputs contain more than two modalities, and such information is critical for prediction accuracy. Furthermore, these methods do not adequately interpret the relationships between the decoupled features at the fusion stage. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Complete Feature Disentanglement (CFD) strategy that recovers the lost information during feature decoupling. Specifically, the CFD strategy not only identifies modality-shared and modality-specific features, but also decouples shared features among subsets of multimodal inputs, termed as modality-partial-shared features. We further introduce a new Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts Fusion (DMF) module that dynamically integrates these decoupled features, by explicitly learning the local-global relationships among the features. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through classification tasks on three multimodal MRI datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art MML methods with obvious margins, showcasing its superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by IEEE JBHI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[MICINet: Multi-Level Inter-Class Confusing Information Removal for Reliable Multimodal Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19674v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable multimodal learning in the presence of noisy data is a widely concerned issue, especially in safety-critical applications. Many reliable multimodal methods delve into addressing modality-specific or cross-modality noise. However, they fail to handle the coexistence of both types of noise efficiently. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive consideration for noise at both global and individual levels limits their reliability. To address these issues, a reliable multimodal classification method dubbed Multi-Level Inter-Class Confusing Information Removal Network (MICINet) is proposed. MICINet achieves the reliable removal of both types of noise by unifying them into the concept of Inter-class Confusing Information (\textit{ICI}) and eliminating it at both global and individual levels. Specifically, MICINet first reliably learns the global \textit{ICI} distribution through the proposed \textbf{\textit{Global \textbf{ICI} Learning Module}}. Then, it introduces the \textbf{\textit{Global-guided Sample ICI Learning module}} to efficiently remove global-level \textit{ICI} from sample features utilizing the learned global \textit{ICI} distribution. Subsequently, the \textbf{\textit{Sample-adaptive Cross-modality Information Compensation module}} is designed to remove individual-level \textit{ICI} from each sample reliably. This is achieved through interpretable cross-modality information compensation based on the complementary relationship between discriminative features and \textit{ICI} and the perception of the relative quality of modalities introduced by the relative discriminative power. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MICINet outperforms other state-of-the-art reliable multimodal classification methods under various noise conditions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures | None |

Existing research mainly focuses on structured data, e.g. demographics and vital signs, and lacks effective frameworks to integrate clinical notes from heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs). This study aims to explore a multimodal framework based on belief function theory that can effectively fuse heterogeneous structured EHRs and free-text notes for accurate and reliable ICU outcome prediction. The fusion strategy accounts for prediction uncertainty within each modality and conflicts between multimodal data. The experiments on MIMIC-III dataset show that our framework provides more accurate and reliable predictions than existing approaches. Specifically, it outperformed the best baseline by 1.05%/1.02% in BACC, 9.74%/6.04% in F1 score, 1.28%/0.9% in AUROC, and 6.21%/2.68% in AUPRC for predicting mortality and PLOS, respectively. Additionally, it improved the reliability of the predictions with a 26.8%/15.1% reduction in the Brier score and a 25.0%/13.3% reduction in negative log-likelihood. By effectively reducing false positives, the model can aid in better allocation of medical resources in the ICU. Furthermore, the proposed method is very versatile and can be extended to analyzing multimodal EHRs for other clinical tasks.

Collaborative programming emerges as an effective method for instructors to support novice students in developing coding and teamwork abilities. However, due to limited class time and attention, instructors face challenges in monitoring and evaluating the progress and performance of groups or individuals. To address this issue, we collect multimodal data from real-world settings and develop CPVis, an interactive visual analytics system designed to assess student collaboration dynamically. Specifically, CPVis enables instructors to evaluate both group and individual performance efficiently. CPVis employs a novel flower-based visual encoding to represent performance and provides time-based views to capture the evolution of collaborative behaviors. A within-subject experiment (N=22), comparing CPVis with two baseline systems, reveals that users gain more insights, find the visualization more intuitive, and report increased confidence in their assessments of collaboration.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods produce coarse patch-sized embeddings, limiting their effectiveness and integration with other modalities like LiDAR. To close this gap, we present DUNIA, an approach to learn pixel-sized embeddings through cross-modal alignment between images and full-waveform LiDAR data. As the model is trained in a contrastive manner, the embeddings can be directly leveraged in the context of a variety of environmental monitoring tasks in a zero-shot setting. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings for seven such tasks (canopy height mapping, fractional canopy cover, land cover mapping, tree species identification, plant area index, crop type classification, and per-pixel waveform-based vertical structure mapping). The results show that the embeddings, along with zero-shot classifiers, often outperform specialized supervised models, even in low data regimes. In the fine-tuning setting, we show strong low-shot capabilities with performances near or better than state-of-the-art on five out of six tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures | None |

Recent multimodal learning advances focus on cross-modal alignment, but existing molecule-text models ignore complementary information in different molecular views and rely on single-view representations, limiting molecular understanding. Moreover, na\"ive multi-view alignment strategies face two challenges: (1) separate aligned spaces with inconsistent mappings between molecule and text embeddings, and that (2) existing loss objectives fail to preserve complementary information for fine-grained alignment. This can limit the LLM's ability to fully understand the molecular properties. To address these issues, we propose MV-CLAM, a novel framework that aligns multi-view molecular representations into a unified textual space using a multi-query transformer (MQ-Former). Our approach ensures cross-view consistency while a token-level contrastive loss preserves diverse molecular features across textual queries. MV-CLAM enhances molecular reasoning, improving retrieval and captioning accuracy.

However, it is often hindered by the multimodal imbalance problem, where certain modality dominates while others remain underutilized. Although recent studies have proposed various methods to alleviate this problem, they lack comprehensive and fair comparisons. In this paper, we systematically categorize various mainstream multimodal imbalance algorithms into four groups based on the strategies they employ to mitigate imbalance. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, we introduce BalanceBenchmark, a benchmark including multiple widely used multidimensional datasets and evaluation metrics from three perspectives: performance, imbalance degree, and complexity. To ensure fair comparisons, we have developed a modular and extensible toolkit that standardizes the experimental workflow across different methods. Based on the experiments using BalanceBenchmark, we have identified several key insights into the characteristics and advantages of different method groups in terms of performance, balance degree and computational complexity. We expect such analysis could inspire more efficient approaches to address the imbalance problem in the future, as well as foundation models.

Here, we investigate whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit similar category-selective neurons and how these neurons vary across model layers and between purely visual and vision-language models. Inspired by fMRI functional localizer experiments, we presented images from different categories (faces, bodies, scenes, words, scrambled scenes, and scrambled words) to deep networks and identified category-selective neurons using statistical criteria. Comparing ResNet and the structurally controlled ResNet-based CLIP model, we found that both models contain category-selective neurons, with their proportion increasing across layers, mirroring category selectivity in higher-level visual brain regions. However, CLIP exhibited a higher proportion but lower specificity of category-selective neurons compared to ResNet. Additionally, CLIP's category-selective neurons were more evenly distributed across feature maps and demonstrated greater representational consistency across layers. These findings suggest that language learning increases the number of category-selective neurons while reducing their selectivity strength, reshaping visual representations in deep networks. Our study provides insights into how ANNs mirror biological vision and how multimodal learning influences category-selective representations.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior research primarily focused on explicitly aligning these representations through targeted learning objectives and model architectures, a recent line of work has found that independently trained unimodal models of increasing scale and performance can become implicitly aligned with each other. These findings raise fundamental questions regarding the emergence of aligned representations in multimodal learning. Specifically: (1) when and why does alignment emerge implicitly? and (2) is alignment a reliable indicator of performance? Through a comprehensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that both the emergence of alignment and its relationship with task performance depend on several critical data characteristics. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the degree of similarity between the modalities and the balance between redundant and unique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest that alignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance varies depending on the dataset and task. These insights can help practitioners determine whether increasing alignment between modalities is advantageous or, in some cases, detrimental to achieving optimal performance.

RIG generates two key instruction data: 1) the Adversarial Instruction-following data, which features mixed negative and positive samples to enhance the model's discriminative understanding. 2) the Diverse Instruction-following data, which contains various instruction styles to enhance model's generalization. As a result, we construct 1 million instruction-following data, consisting of 344K Adversarial samples, 508K Diverse samples, and 165K benchmark training set samples. To better handle these complex instructions, Robin3D first incorporates Relation-Augmented Projector to enhance spatial understanding, and then strengthens the object referring and grounding ability through ID-Feature Bonding. Robin3D consistently outperforms previous methods across five widely-used 3D multimodal learning benchmarks, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning.

The task aims to infer objects' physics commonsense based on both video and audio input, with the main challenge being how to imitate the reasoning ability of humans, even under the scenario of missing modalities. Most of the current methods fail to take full advantage of different characteristics in multi-modal data, and lacking causal reasoning ability in models impedes the progress of implicit physical knowledge inferring. To address these issues, our proposed RDCL method decouples videos into static (time-invariant) and dynamic (time-varying) factors in the latent space by the disentangled sequential encoder, which adopts a variational autoencoder (VAE) to maximize the mutual information with a contrastive loss function. Furthermore, we introduce a counterfactual learning module to augment the model's reasoning ability by modeling physical knowledge relationships among different objects under counterfactual intervention. To alleviate the incomplete modality data issue, we introduce a robust multimodal learning method to recover the missing data by decomposing the shared features and model-specific features. Our proposed method is a plug-and-play module that can be incorporated into any baseline including VLMs. In experiments, we show that our proposed method improves the reasoning accuracy and robustness of baseline methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the task of generating binaural spatial audio from text, which provides a more immersive auditory experience by incorporating the sense of spatiality, have not been explored yet. In this work, we introduce text-guided binaural audio generation. As an early effort, we focus on the scenario where a monaural reference audio is given additionally. The core problem is to associate specific sound events with their directions, thereby creating binaural spatial audio. The challenge lies in the complexity of textual descriptions and the limited availability of single-source sound event datasets. To address this, we propose AudioSpa, an end-to-end model that applies large language models to process both acoustic and textual information. We employ fusion multi-head attention (FMHA) to integrate text tokens, which enhances the generation capability of the multimodal learning. Additionally, we propose a binaural source localization model to assess the quality of the generated audio. Finally, we design a data augmentation strategy to generate diverse datasets, which enables the model to spatialize sound events across various spatial positions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to put sounds at the specified locations accurately. It achieves competitive performance in both localization accuracy and signal distortion.

| **[Gramian Multimodal Representation Learning and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11959v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human perception integrates multiple modalities, such as vision, hearing, and language, into a unified understanding of the surrounding reality. While recent multimodal models have achieved significant progress by aligning pairs of modalities via contrastive learning, their solutions are unsuitable when scaling to multiple modalities. These models typically align each modality to a designated anchor without ensuring the alignment of all modalities with each other, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring a joint understanding of multiple modalities. In this paper, we structurally rethink the pairwise conventional approach to multimodal learning and we present the novel Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM), which overcomes the above-mentioned limitations. GRAM learns and then aligns $n$ modalities directly in the higher-dimensional space in which modality embeddings lie by minimizing the Gramian volume of the $k$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the modality vectors, ensuring the geometric alignment of all modalities simultaneously. GRAM can replace cosine similarity in any downstream method, holding for 2 to $n$ modalities and providing more meaningful alignment with respect to previous similarity measures. The novel GRAM-based contrastive loss function enhances the alignment of multimodal models in the higher-dimensional embedding space, leading to new state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as video-audio-text retrieval and audio-video classification.

We show that data balancing across modalities and sources actually offers an unsuspected benefit: variance reduction. We present a non-asymptotic statistical bound that quantifies this variance reduction effect and relates it to the eigenvalue decay of Markov operators. Furthermore, we describe how various forms of data balancing in contrastive multimodal learning and self-supervised clustering can be better understood, and even improved upon, owing to our variance reduction viewpoint.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Musical Representations for Music Performance Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06710v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music performances are representative scenarios for audio-visual modeling. Unlike common scenarios with sparse audio, music performances continuously involve dense audio signals throughout. While existing multimodal learning methods on the audio-video QA demonstrate impressive capabilities in general scenarios, they are incapable of dealing with fundamental problems within the music performances: they underexplore the interaction between the multimodal signals in performance and fail to consider the distinctive characteristics of instruments and music. Therefore, existing methods tend to answer questions regarding musical performances inaccurately. To bridge the above research gaps, (i) given the intricate multimodal interconnectivity inherent to music data, our primary backbone is designed to incorporate multimodal interactions within the context of music; (ii) to enable the model to learn music characteristics, we annotate and release rhythmic and music sources in the current music datasets; (iii) for time-aware audio-visual modeling, we align the model's music predictions with the temporal dimension. Our experiments show state-of-the-art effects on the Music AVQA datasets.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) stand out due to their ability to represent crystal structures as graphs, effectively capturing local interactions and delivering superior predictions. However, these methods often lose critical global information, such as crystal systems and repetitive unit connectivity. To address this, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal fusion model that integrates graph and text modalities to preserve essential material information. CAST combines node- and token-level features using cross-attention mechanisms, surpassing previous approaches reliant on material-level embeddings like graph mean-pooling or [CLS] tokens. A masked node prediction pretraining strategy further enhances atomic-level information integration. Our method achieved up to 22.9\% improvement in property prediction across four crystal properties including band gap compared to methods like CrysMMNet and MultiMat. Pretraining was key to aligning node and text embeddings, with attention maps confirming its effectiveness in capturing relationships between nodes and tokens. This study highlights the potential of multimodal learning in materials science, paving the way for more robust predictive models that incorporate both local and global information.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures | None |

As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, opening new frontiers in chemical understanding and drug discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML), a specifically designed approach to enhance molecular understanding and accelerate advancements in drug discovery. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC). Ultimately, ACML exemplifies its potential to revolutionize molecular representational learning, offering deeper insights into the chemical semantics of diverse modalities and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in chemical research and drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

However, despite video's potential, it is hard to use, leaving a gap in providing concise, data-driven summaries for supporting effective debriefing. Addressing this, we present TeamVision, an AI-powered multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) system that captures voice presence, automated transcriptions, body rotation, and positioning data, offering educators a dashboard to guide debriefs immediately after simulations. We conducted an in-the-wild study with 56 teams (221 students) and recorded debriefs led by six teachers using TeamVision. Follow-up interviews with 15 students and five teachers explored perceptions of its usefulness, accuracy, and trustworthiness. This paper examines: i) how TeamVision was used in debriefing, ii) what educators found valuable and challenging, and iii) perceptions of its effectiveness. Results suggest TeamVision enables flexible debriefing and highlights the challenges and implications of using AI-powered systems in healthcare simulation.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 | None |
| **[Efficiently Integrate Large Language Models with Visual Perception: A Survey from the Training Paradigm Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01524v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of vision-language modalities has been a significant focus in multimodal learning, traditionally relying on Vision-Language Pretrained Models. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a notable shift towards incorporating LLMs with vision modalities. Following this, the training paradigms for incorporating vision modalities into LLMs have evolved. Initially, the approach was to integrate the modalities through pretraining the modality integrator, named Single-stage Tuning. It has since branched out into methods focusing on performance enhancement, denoted as Two-stage Tuning, and those prioritizing parameter efficiency, referred to as Direct Adaptation. However, existing surveys primarily address the latest Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with Two-stage Tuning, leaving a gap in understanding the evolution of training paradigms and their unique parameter-efficient considerations. This paper categorizes and reviews 34 VLLMs from top conferences, journals, and highly cited Arxiv papers, focusing on parameter efficiency during adaptation from the training paradigm perspective. We first introduce the architecture of LLMs and parameter-efficient learning methods, followed by a discussion on vision encoders and a comprehensive taxonomy of modality integrators. We then review three training paradigms and their efficiency considerations, summarizing benchmarks in the VLLM field. To gain deeper insights into their effectiveness in parameter efficiency, we compare and discuss the experimental results of representative models, among which the experiment of the Direct Adaptation paradigm is replicated. Providing insights into recent developments and practical uses, this survey is a vital guide for researchers and practitioners navigating the efficient integration of vision modalities into LLMs.</p></details> | 28 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[MIND: Modality-Informed Knowledge Distillation Framework for Multimodal Clinical Prediction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01158v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion leverages information across modalities to learn better feature representations with the goal of improving performance in fusion-based tasks. However, multimodal datasets, especially in medical settings, are typically smaller than their unimodal counterparts, which can impede the performance of multimodal models. Additionally, the increase in the number of modalities is often associated with an overall increase in the size of the multimodal network, which may be undesirable in medical use cases. Utilizing smaller unimodal encoders may lead to sub-optimal performance, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional clinical data. In this paper, we propose the Modality-INformed knowledge Distillation (MIND) framework, a multimodal model compression approach based on knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge from ensembles of pre-trained deep neural networks of varying sizes into a smaller multimodal student. The teacher models consist of unimodal networks, allowing the student to learn from diverse representations. MIND employs multi-head joint fusion models, as opposed to single-head models, enabling the use of unimodal encoders in the case of unimodal samples without requiring imputation or masking of absent modalities. As a result, MIND generates an optimized multimodal model, enhancing both multimodal and unimodal representations. It can also be leveraged to balance multimodal learning during training. We evaluate MIND on binary and multilabel clinical prediction tasks using time series data and chest X-ray images. Additionally, we assess the generalizability of the MIND framework on three non-medical multimodal multiclass datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MIND enhances the performance of the smaller multimodal network across all five tasks, as well as various fusion methods and multimodal architectures, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025), https://openreview.net/forum?id=BhOJreYmur&noteId=ymnAhncuez</p></details> | None |

Despite these advances, foundation models are still limited in their ability to encode the entire gigapixel whole-slide images without additional training and often lack complementary multimodal data. Here, we introduce Threads, a slide-level foundation model capable of generating universal representations of whole-slide images of any size. Threads was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse cohort of 47,171 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections, paired with corresponding genomic and transcriptomic profiles - the largest such paired dataset to be used for foundation model development to date. This unique training paradigm enables Threads to capture the tissue's underlying molecular composition, yielding powerful representations applicable to a wide array of downstream tasks. In extensive benchmarking across 54 oncology tasks, including clinical subtyping, grading, mutation prediction, immunohistochemistry status determination, treatment response prediction, and survival prediction, Threads outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and label efficiency. It is particularly well suited for predicting rare events, further emphasizing its clinical utility. We intend to make the model publicly available for the broader community.</p></details> |  | None |

This study presents a multi-stage intermediate fusion approach to classify NSCLC subtypes from CT and PET images. Our method integrates the two modalities at different stages of feature extraction, using voxel-wise fusion to exploit complementary information across varying abstraction levels while preserving spatial correlations. We compare our method against unimodal approaches using only CT or PET images to demonstrate the benefits of modality fusion, and further benchmark it against early and late fusion techniques to highlight the advantages of intermediate fusion during feature extraction. Additionally, we compare our model with the only existing intermediate fusion method for histological subtype classification using PET/CT images. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all alternatives across key metrics, with an accuracy and AUC equal to 0.724 and 0.681, respectively. This non-invasive approach has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate more informed treatment decisions, and advance personalized care in lung cancer management.</p></details> |  | None |

Early prediction and timely intervention of its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), can decrease the risk of advancing to AD. Combining information from various modalities can significantly improve predictive accuracy. However, challenges such as missing data and heterogeneity across modalities complicate multimodal learning methods as adding more modalities can worsen these issues. Current multimodal fusion techniques often fail to adapt to the complexity of medical data, hindering the ability to identify relationships between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative multimodal approach for predicting MCI conversion, focusing specifically on the issues of missing positron emission tomography (PET) data and integrating diverse medical information. The proposed incomplete triple-modal MCI conversion prediction network is tailored for this purpose. Through the missing modal generation module, we synthesize the missing PET data from the magnetic resonance imaging and extract features using specifically designed encoders. We also develop a channel aggregation module and a triple-modal co-attention fusion module to reduce feature redundancy and achieve effective multimodal data fusion. Furthermore, we design a loss function to handle missing modality issues and align cross-modal features. These components collectively harness multimodal data to boost network performance. Experimental results on the ADNI1 and ADNI2 datasets show that our method significantly surpasses existing unimodal and other multimodal models.

Transferring CLIP to downstream tasks (e.g. zero- or few-shot classification) is a hot topic in multimodal learning. However, current studies primarily focus on either prompt learning for text or adapter tuning for vision, without fully exploiting the complementary information and correlations among image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose an Image Description Enhanced CLIP-Adapter (IDEA) method to adapt CLIP to few-shot image classification tasks. This method captures fine-grained features by leveraging both visual features and textual descriptions of images. IDEA is a training-free method for CLIP, and it can be comparable to or even exceeds state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks. Furthermore, we introduce Trainable-IDEA (T-IDEA), which extends IDEA by adding two lightweight learnable components (i.e., a projector and a learnable latent space), further enhancing the model's performance and achieving SOTA results on 11 datasets. As one important contribution, we employ the Llama model and design a comprehensive pipeline to generate textual descriptions for images of 11 datasets, resulting in a total of 1,637,795 image-text pairs, named "IMD-11".

The advent of deep learning (DL) techniques has revolutionized this field by enabling autonomous feature extraction, significantly reducing the dependence on manual expertise. However, conventional DL models often rely solely on single data sources, failing to capture the full biological diversity of plant species comprehensively. Recent research has turned to multimodal learning to overcome this limitation by integrating multiple data types, which enriches the representation of plant characteristics. This shift introduces the challenge of determining the optimal point for modality fusion. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering multimodal DL-based approach for plant classification with automatic modality fusion. Utilizing the multimodal fusion architecture search, our method integrates images from multiple plant organs -- flowers, leaves, fruits, and stems -- into a cohesive model. To address the lack of multimodal datasets, we contributed Multimodal-PlantCLEF, a restructured version of the PlantCLEF2015 dataset tailored for multimodal tasks. Our method achieves 82.61% accuracy on 979 classes of Multimodal-PlantCLEF, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and outperforming late fusion by 10.33%. Through the incorporation of multimodal dropout, our approach demonstrates strong robustness to missing modalities. We validate our model against established benchmarks using standard performance metrics and McNemar's test, further underscoring its superiority.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, multimodal learning methods, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), have advanced significantly in jointly understanding images and text. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of CLIP in classifying human postures, focusing on its application in yoga. Despite the initial limitations of the zero-shot approach, applying transfer learning on 15,301 images (real and synthetic) with 82 classes has shown promising results. The article describes the full procedure for fine-tuning, including the choice for image description syntax, models and hyperparameters adjustment. The fine-tuned CLIP model, tested on 3826 images, achieves an accuracy of over 85%, surpassing the current state-of-the-art of previous works on the same dataset by approximately 6%, its training time being 3.5 times lower than what is needed to fine-tune a YOLOv8-based model. For more application-oriented scenarios, with smaller datasets of six postures each, containing 1301 and 401 training images, the fine-tuned models attain an accuracy of 98.8% and 99.1%, respectively. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that training with as few as 20 images per pose can yield around 90% accuracy in a six-class dataset. This study demonstrates that this multimodal technique can be effectively used for yoga pose classification, and possibly for human posture classification, in general. Additionally, CLIP inference time (around 7 ms) supports that the model can be integrated into automated systems for posture evaluation, e.g., for developing a real-time personal yoga assistant for performance assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

CIR finds applications in a variety of domains including product retrieval (e-commerce) and web search. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning, wherein models are trained on datasets of labeled triplets such as FashionIQ and CIRR. This poses two significant challenges: (i) curating such triplet datasets is labor intensive; and (ii) models lack generalization to unseen objects and domains. In this work, we propose SCOT (Self-supervised COmpositional Training), a novel zero-shot compositional pretraining strategy that combines existing large image-text pair datasets with the generative capabilities of large language models to contrastively train an embedding composition network. Specifically, we show that the text embedding from a large-scale contrastively-pretrained vision-language model can be utilized as proxy target supervision during compositional pretraining, replacing the target image embedding. In zero-shot settings, this strategy surpasses SOTA zero-shot compositional retrieval methods as well as many fully-supervised methods on standard benchmarks such as FashionIQ and CIRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at WACV 2025 in round 1</p></details> | None |

Inspired by transfer learning techniques in NLP, adapters and prefix tuning, this paper presents a new model-agnostic plugin architecture for cross-learning, called CM3T, that adapts transformer-based models to new or missing information. We introduce two adapter blocks: multi-head vision adapters for transfer learning and cross-attention adapters for multimodal learning. Training becomes substantially efficient as the backbone and other plugins do not need to be finetuned along with these additions. Comparative and ablation studies on three datasets Epic-Kitchens-100, MPIIGroupInteraction and UDIVA v0.5 show efficacy of this framework on different recording settings and tasks. With only 12.8% trainable parameters compared to the backbone to process video input and only 22.3% trainable parameters for two additional modalities, we achieve comparable and even better results than the state-of-the-art. CM3T has no specific requirements for training or pretraining and is a step towards bridging the gap between a general model and specific practical applications of video classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Early diagnosis is challenging due to subtle symptoms and varied presentations, often leading to misdiagnosis with traditional unimodal diagnostic methods due to their limited scope. This study introduces an advanced multimodal classification model that integrates clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and EEG data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The model incorporates a feature tagger with a tabular data coding architecture and utilizes the TimesBlock module to capture intricate temporal patterns in Electroencephalograms (EEG) data. By employing Cross-modal Attention Aggregation module, the model effectively fuses Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) spatial information with EEG temporal data, significantly improving the distinction between AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Normal Cognition. Simultaneously, we have constructed the first AD classification dataset that includes three modalities: EEG, MRI, and tabular data.

However, in real-world scenarios, multi-modal systems often face the challenge of dynamic modality contributions, the dominance of different modalities may change with the environments, leading to suboptimal performance in multimodal learning. Current methods mainly enhance weak modalities to balance multimodal representation bias, which inevitably optimizes from a partialmodality perspective, easily leading to performance descending for dominant modalities. To address this problem, we propose an Asymmetric Reinforcing method against Multimodal representation bias (ARM). Our ARM dynamically reinforces the weak modalities while maintaining the ability to represent dominant modalities through conditional mutual information. Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis that optimizing certain modalities could cause information loss and prevent leveraging the full advantages of multimodal data. By exploring the dominance and narrowing the contribution gaps between modalities, we have significantly improved the performance of multimodal learning, making notable progress in mitigating imbalanced multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Recently, researchers have focused on enhancing the robustness of pre-trained MultiModal Transformers (MMTs) under missing modality conditions by applying learnable prompts. However, these prompt-based methods face several limitations: (1) incomplete modalities provide restricted modal cues for task-specific inference, (2) dummy imputation for missing content causes information loss and introduces noise, and (3) static prompts are instance-agnostic, offering limited knowledge for instances with various missing conditions. To address these issues, we propose RAGPT, a novel Retrieval-AuGmented dynamic Prompt Tuning framework. RAGPT comprises three modules: (I) the multi-channel retriever, which identifies similar instances through a within-modality retrieval strategy, (II) the missing modality generator, which recovers missing information using retrieved contexts, and (III) the context-aware prompter, which captures contextual knowledge from relevant instances and generates dynamic prompts to largely enhance the MMT's robustness.

As an important subfield, video-language representation learning focuses on learning representations using global semantic interactions between pre-defined video-text pairs. However, to enhance and refine such coarse-grained global interactions, more detailed interactions are necessary for fine-grained multimodal learning. In this study, we introduce a new approach that models video-text as game players using multivariate cooperative game theory to handle uncertainty during fine-grained semantic interactions with diverse granularity, flexible combination, and vague intensity. Specifically, we design the Hierarchical Banzhaf Interaction to simulate the fine-grained correspondence between video clips and textual words from hierarchical perspectives. Furthermore, to mitigate the bias in calculations within Banzhaf Interaction, we propose reconstructing the representation through a fusion of single-modal and cross-modal components. This reconstructed representation ensures fine granularity comparable to that of the single-modal representation, while also preserving the adaptive encoding characteristics of cross-modal representation. Additionally, we extend our original structure into a flexible encoder-decoder framework, enabling the model to adapt to various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on commonly used text-video retrieval, video-question answering, and video captioning benchmarks, with superior performance, validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2303.14369</p></details> | None |

| **[Diff4MMLiTS: Advanced Multimodal Liver Tumor Segmentation via Diffusion-Based Image Synthesis and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20418v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has been demonstrated to enhance performance across various clinical tasks, owing to the diverse perspectives offered by different modalities of data. However, existing multimodal segmentation methods rely on well-registered multimodal data, which is unrealistic for real-world clinical images, particularly for indistinct and diffuse regions such as liver tumors. In this paper, we introduce Diff4MMLiTS, a four-stage multimodal liver tumor segmentation pipeline: pre-registration of the target organs in multimodal CTs; dilation of the annotated modality's mask and followed by its use in inpainting to obtain multimodal normal CTs without tumors; synthesis of strictly aligned multimodal CTs with tumors using the latent diffusion model based on multimodal CT features and randomly generated tumor masks; and finally, training the segmentation model, thus eliminating the need for strictly aligned multimodal data. Extensive experiments on public and internal datasets demonstrate the superiority of Diff4MMLiTS over other state-of-the-art multimodal segmentation methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Head Attention Driven Dynamic Visual-Semantic Embedding for Enhanced Image-Text Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19184v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of multimodal learning, the image-text matching task, as a bridge connecting vision and language, has become increasingly important. Based on existing research, this study proposes an innovative visual semantic embedding model, Multi-Headed Consensus-Aware Visual-Semantic Embedding (MH-CVSE). This model introduces a multi-head self-attention mechanism based on the consensus-aware visual semantic embedding model (CVSE) to capture information in multiple subspaces in parallel, significantly enhancing the model's ability to understand and represent the complex relationship between images and texts. In addition, we adopt a parameterized feature fusion strategy to flexibly integrate feature information at different levels, further improving the model's expressive power. In terms of loss function design, the MH-CVSE model adopts a dynamic weight adjustment strategy to dynamically adjust the weight according to the loss value itself, so that the model can better balance the contribution of different loss terms during training. At the same time, we introduce a cosine annealing learning rate strategy to help the model converge more stably in the later stages of training. Extensive experimental verification on the Flickr30k dataset shows that the MH-CVSE model achieves better performance than previous methods in both bidirectional image and text retrieval tasks, fully demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  | None |

However, typically 3D multimodal models are only capable of handling point clouds. Compared to the emerging 3D representation technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the spatially sparse point cloud cannot depict the texture information of 3D objects, resulting in inferior reconstruction capabilities. This limitation constrains the potential of point cloud-based 3D multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we present CLIP-GS, a novel multimodal representation learning framework grounded in 3DGS. We introduce the GS Tokenizer to generate serialized gaussian tokens, which are then processed through transformer layers pre-initialized with weights from point cloud models, resulting in the 3DGS embeddings. CLIP-GS leverages contrastive loss between 3DGS and the visual-text embeddings of CLIP, and we introduce an image voting loss to guide the directionality and convergence of gradient optimization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient way to generate triplets of 3DGS, images, and text, facilitating CLIP-GS in learning unified multimodal representations. Leveraging the well-aligned multimodal representations, CLIP-GS demonstrates versatility and outperforms point cloud-based models on various 3D tasks, including multimodal retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification.</p></details> |  | None |

Large-scale multimodal datasets are essential because they allow for thorough testing and training of these models. With an emphasis on their contributions to the discipline, the study examines a variety of datasets, including those for training, domain-specific tasks, and real-world applications. It also emphasizes how crucial benchmark datasets are for assessing models' performance in a range of scenarios, scalability, and applicability.

Existing methods for managing missing modalities often require the design of separate prompts for each modality or missing case, leading to complex designs and a substantial increase in the number of parameters to be learned. As the number of modalities grows, these methods become increasingly inefficient due to parameter redundancy. To address these issues, we propose Evidence-based Parameter-Efficient Prompting (EPE-P), a novel and parameter-efficient method for pretrained multimodal networks. Our approach introduces a streamlined design that integrates prompting information across different modalities, reducing complexity and mitigating redundant parameters. Furthermore, we propose an Evidence-based Loss function to better handle the uncertainty associated with missing modalities, improving the model's decision-making. Our experiments demonstrate that EPE-P outperforms existing prompting-based methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

However, the collisions of the capsule endoscopies within the gastrointestinal tract cause vibration perturbations in the training data. Existing solutions focus solely on vision-based processing, neglecting other auxiliary signals like vibrations that could reduce noise and improve performance. Therefore, we propose V$^2$-SfMLearner, a multimodal approach integrating vibration signals into vision-based depth and capsule motion estimation for monocular capsule endoscopy. We construct a multimodal capsule endoscopy dataset containing vibration and visual signals, and our artificial intelligence solution develops an unsupervised method using vision-vibration signals, effectively eliminating vibration perturbations through multimodal learning. Specifically, we carefully design a vibration network branch and a Fourier fusion module, to detect and mitigate vibration noises. The fusion framework is compatible with popular vision-only algorithms. Extensive validation on the multimodal dataset demonstrates superior performance and robustness against vision-only algorithms. Without the need for large external equipment, our V$^2$-SfMLearner has the potential for integration into clinical capsule robots, providing real-time and dependable digestive examination tools. The findings show promise for practical implementation in clinical settings, enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of doctors.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (IEEE TASE)</p></details> | None |
| **[Alt-MoE:A Scalable Framework for Bidirectional Multimodal Alignment and Efficient Knowledge Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05929v3)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has advanced significantly by aligning different modalities within shared latent spaces, enabling tasks such as cross-modal understanding and generation. Current alignment strategies in multimodal learning primarily include direct alignment using pre-trained or unified encoders and single-directional alignment via modality-specific connectors. Direct alignment struggles to fully leverage rich intra-modal knowledge, often requiring extensive training data to achieve cross-modal representation. Meanwhile, single-directional alignment methods, despite leveraging pre-trained knowledge, restrict task adaptability and hinder the model's ability to capture bidirectional relationships, leading to incomplete knowledge fusion and underutilization of complementary modality-specific information. To address these limitations, we introduce Alt-MoE, a scalable multimodal alignment framework that employs a mixture of experts (MoE) model as a multi-directional connector across modalities. By utilizing a sequential alternating one-way alignment strategy, Alt-MoE iteratively refines the model to achieve bidirectional alignment. Alt-MoE operates in latent space, enabling efficient vector pre-storage and real-time retrieval via MoE, optimizing large-scale data processing. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that Alt-MoE achieves competitive performance on cross-modal retrieval and visual question answering by integrating diverse modality-specific knowledge, generalizing to unseen data, and easily scaling to new tasks and modalities through dynamic adjustment of MoE capacity and expert activation.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |
| **[Assessing Modality Bias in Video Question Answering Benchmarks with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12763v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can simultaneously process visual, textual, and auditory data, capturing insights that complement human analysis. However, existing video question-answering (VidQA) benchmarks and datasets often exhibit a bias toward a single modality, despite the goal of requiring advanced reasoning skills that integrate diverse modalities to answer the queries. In this work, we introduce the modality importance score (MIS) to identify such bias. It is designed to assess which modality embeds the necessary information to answer the question. Additionally, we propose an innovative method using state-of-the-art MLLMs to estimate the modality importance, which can serve as a proxy for human judgments of modality perception. With this MIS, we demonstrate the presence of unimodal bias and the scarcity of genuinely multimodal questions in existing datasets. We further validate the modality importance score with multiple ablation studies to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on permuted feature sets. Our results indicate that current models do not effectively integrate information due to modality imbalance in existing datasets. Our proposed MLLM-derived MIS can guide the curation of modality-balanced datasets that advance multimodal learning and enhance MLLMs' capabilities to understand and utilize synergistic relations across modalities.</p></details> |  | None |

The subtask, known as the Multi-modal Aerial View Imagery Challenge - Classification, focuses on predicting the class label of a low-resolution aerial image based on a set of SAR-EO image pairs and their respective class labels. The provided dataset consists of SAR-EO pairs, characterized by a severe long-tail distribution with over a 1000-fold difference between the largest and smallest classes, making typical long-tail methods difficult to apply. Additionally, the domain disparity between the SAR and EO datasets complicates the effectiveness of standard multimodal methods. To address these significant challenges, we propose a two-stage learning approach that utilizes self-supervised techniques, combined with multimodal learning and inference through SAR-to-EO translation for effective EO utilization. In the final testing phase of the PBVS 2024 Multi-modal Aerial View Image Challenge - Classification (SAR Classification) task, our model achieved an accuracy of 21.45%, an AUC of 0.56, and a total score of 0.30, placing us 9th in the competition.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, 1 Table</p></details> | None |

Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) are designed to bridge different modalities, such as images and text, by learning a shared representation space through contrastive learning. Despite their success, the working mechanisms underlying multimodal learning are not yet well understood. Notably, these models often exhibit a modality gap, where different modalities occupy distinct regions within the shared representation space. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the emergence of modality gap by characterizing the gradient flow learning dynamics. Specifically, we identify the critical roles of mismatched data pairs and a learnable temperature parameter in causing and perpetuating the modality gap during training. Furthermore, our theoretical insights are validated through experiments on practical CLIP models. These findings provide principled guidance for mitigating the modality gap, including strategies such as appropriate temperature scheduling and modality swapping. Additionally, we demonstrate that closing the modality gap leads to improved performance on tasks such as image-text retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> | None |
| **[Multimodal Fusion Balancing Through Game-Theoretic Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07335v2)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning can complete the picture of information extraction by uncovering key dependencies between data sources. However, current systems fail to fully leverage multiple modalities for optimal performance. This has been attributed to modality competition, where modalities strive for training resources, leaving some underoptimized. We show that current balancing methods struggle to train multimodal models that surpass even simple baselines, such as ensembles. This raises the question: how can we ensure that all modalities in multimodal training are sufficiently trained, and that learning from new modalities consistently improves performance? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) Introducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each modality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final outcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and is the first to consistently improve multimodal learning beyond the ensemble baseline, clearly demonstrating that combining modalities leads to significant performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> | None |

To address this problem, researchers attempt to fuse information from other modalities via multimodal learning.

In this paper, we propose WavFusion, a multimodal speech emotion recognition framework that addresses critical research problems in effective multimodal fusion, heterogeneity among modalities, and discriminative representation learning. By leveraging a gated cross-modal attention mechanism and multimodal homogeneous feature discrepancy learning, WavFusion demonstrates improved performance over existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101.

While this process adapts LLMs to multimodal settings, it remains unclear whether this adaptation compromises their original language reasoning capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of multimodal instruction tuning on language reasoning performance. We focus on LLaVA, a leading multimodal framework that integrates LLMs such as Vicuna or Mistral with the CLIP vision encoder. We compare the performance of the original LLMs with their multimodal-adapted counterparts across eight language reasoning tasks. Our experiments yield several key insights. First, the impact of multimodal learning varies between Vicuna and Mistral: we observe a degradation in language reasoning for Mistral but improvements for Vicuna across most tasks. Second, while multimodal instruction learning consistently degrades performance on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K), it enhances performance on commonsense reasoning tasks (e.g., CommonsenseQA). Finally, we demonstrate that a training-free model merging technique can effectively mitigate the language reasoning degradation observed in multimodal-adapted Mistral and even improve performance on visual tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) can be used to facilitate computer-assisted interventions, despite often suffering from artifacts that pose challenges for accurate interpretation. While the degraded image quality can affect image analysis, the availability of high quality, preoperative scans offers potential for improvements. Here we consider a setting where preoperative CT and intraoperative CBCT scans are available, however, the alignment (registration) between the scans is imperfect to simulate a real world scenario. We propose a multimodal learning method that fuses roughly aligned CBCT and CT scans and investigate the effect on segmentation performance. For this experiment we use synthetically generated data containing real CT and synthetic CBCT volumes with corresponding voxel annotations. We show that this fusion setup improves segmentation performance in $18$ out of $20$ investigated setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BVM 2025. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.11650</p></details> | None |

Aligning embeddings from heterogeneous sources while preserving shared and modality-specific information is a fundamental challenge. This paper provides an initial attempt to integrate algebraic geometry into multimodal representation learning, offering a foundational perspective for further exploration. We model image and text data as polynomials over discrete rings, \( \mathbb{Z}_{256}[x] \) and \( \mathbb{Z}_{\|V\|}[x] \), respectively, enabling the use of algebraic tools like fiber products to analyze alignment properties. To accommodate real-world variability, we extend the classical fiber product to an approximate fiber product with a tolerance parameter \( \epsilon \), balancing precision and noise tolerance. We study its dependence on \( \epsilon \), revealing asymptotic behavior, robustness to perturbations, and sensitivity to embedding dimensionality. Additionally, we propose a decomposition of the shared embedding space into orthogonal subspaces, \( Z = Z_s \oplus Z_I \oplus Z_T \), where \( Z_s \) captures shared semantics, and \( Z_I \), \( Z_T \) encode modality-specific features. This decomposition is geometrically interpreted via manifolds and fiber bundles, offering insights into embedding structure and optimization. This framework establishes a principled foundation for analyzing multimodal alignment, uncovering connections between robustness, dimensionality allocation, and algebraic structure. It lays the groundwork for further research on embedding spaces in multimodal learning using algebraic geometry.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing MERC methods assume each utterance has complete modalities, overlooking the common issue of incomplete modalities in real-world scenarios. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved notable results in Incomplete Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (IMERC). However, traditional GNNs focus on binary relationships between nodes, limiting their ability to capture more complex, higher-order information. Moreover, repeated message passing can cause over-smoothing, reducing their capacity to preserve essential high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose a Spectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network (SDR-GNN) for incomplete multimodal learning in conversational emotion recognition. SDR-GNN constructs an utterance semantic interaction graph using a sliding window based on both speaker and context relationships to model emotional dependencies. To capture higher-order and high-frequency information, SDR-GNN utilizes weighted relationship aggregation, ensuring consistent semantic feature extraction across utterances. Additionally, it performs multi-frequency aggregation in the spectral domain, enabling efficient recovery of incomplete modalities by extracting both high- and low-frequency information. Finally, multi-head attention is applied to fuse and optimize features for emotion recognition. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach is effective in incomplete multimodal learning and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures | None |

A key challenge is unimodal bias, where multimodal segmentors over rely on certain modalities, causing performance drops when others are missing, common in real world applications. To this end, we develop the first framework for learning robust segmentor that can handle any combinations of visual modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a parallel multimodal learning strategy for learning a strong teacher. The cross-modal and unimodal distillation is then achieved in the multi scale representation space by transferring the feature level knowledge from multimodal to anymodal segmentors, aiming at addressing the unimodal bias and avoiding over-reliance on specific modalities. Moreover, a prediction level modality agnostic semantic distillation is proposed to achieve semantic knowledge transferring for segmentation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-sensor benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</p></details> | Work in progress | None |

Here, we examine three forms of logical operators: relations, negations, and discrete numbers. We asked human respondents (N=178 in total) to evaluate images generated by a state-of-the-art image-generating AI (DALL-E 3) prompted with these `logical probes', and find that none reliably produce human agreement scores greater than 50\%. The negation probes and numbers (beyond 3) fail most frequently. In a 4th experiment, we assess a `grounded diffusion' pipeline that leverages targeted prompt engineering and structured intermediate representations for greater compositional control, but find its performance is judged even worse than that of DALL-E 3 across prompts. To provide further clarity on potential sources of success and failure in these text-to-image systems, we supplement our 4 core experiments with multiple auxiliary analyses and schematic diagrams, directly quantifying, for example, the relationship between the N-gram frequency of relational prompts and the average match to generated images; the success rates for 3 different prompt modification strategies in the rendering of negation prompts; and the scalar variability / ratio dependence (`approximate numeracy') of prompts involving integers. We conclude by discussing the limitations inherent to `grounded' multimodal learning systems whose grounding relies heavily on vector-based semantics (e.g. DALL-E 3), or under-specified syntactical constraints (e.g. `grounded diffusion'), and propose minimal modifications (inspired by development, based in imagery) that could help to bridge the lingering compositional gap between scale and structure.

To the best of our knowledge, we are one of the pioneering efforts to introduce MoE into MLLMs to address this problem. The experimental results (about 20% improvement) have shown the effectiveness and versatility of our design in various 2D and 3D downstream tasks.

This study introduces a novel methodology for integrating latent class analysis (LCA) within MMLA to map monomodal behavioural indicators into parsimonious multimodal ones. Using a high-fidelity healthcare simulation context, we collected positional, audio, and physiological data, deriving 17 monomodal indicators. LCA identified four distinct latent classes: Collaborative Communication, Embodied Collaboration, Distant Interaction, and Solitary Engagement, each capturing unique monomodal patterns. Epistemic network analysis compared these multimodal indicators with the original monomodal indicators and found that the multimodal approach was more parsimonious while offering higher explanatory power regarding students' task and collaboration performances. The findings highlight the potential of LCA in simplifying the analysis of complex multimodal data while capturing nuanced, cross-modality behaviours, offering actionable insights for educators and enhancing the design of collaborative learning interventions. This study proposes a pathway for advancing MMLA, making it more parsimonious and manageable, and aligning with the principles of learner-centred education.</p></details> |  | None |

However, AI models typically focus on single-task and single-modal data processing, limiting their application. To address this, multimodal scientific computing frameworks have become a trend. The Botfip framework aligns function images with symbolic operation trees through multimodal training, extracting deep scientific information. However, Botfip struggles with processing Formula Strings, leading to inadequate understanding in multimodal learning. To enhance Botfip's learning of Formula Strings and expand its applicability to related tasks, we propose the Botfip-LLM framework based on knowledge distillation, incorporating pre-trained large language models for aligning symbolic tree data. Experimental analysis shows that the choice of LLM is crucial, with ChatGLM-2 outperforming others in training and testing. Botfip-LLM not only improves performance, generalization, and extrapolation over the original Botfip model but also significantly enhances applicability to Formula String-related tasks, enabling more diverse task handling.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach learns from sparse face landmarks and upper-body joints, estimated directly from video data, to generate plausible emotive character motions. Given a speech audio waveform and a token sequence of the speaker's face landmark motion and body-joint motion computed from a video, our method synthesizes the motion sequences for the speaker's face landmarks and body joints to match the content and the affect of the speech. We design a generator consisting of a set of encoders to transform all the inputs into a multimodal embedding space capturing their correlations, followed by a pair of decoders to synthesize the desired face and pose motions. To enhance the plausibility of synthesis, we use an adversarial discriminator that learns to differentiate between the face and pose motions computed from the original videos and our synthesized motions based on their affective expressions. To evaluate our approach, we extend the TED Gesture Dataset to include view-normalized, co-speech face landmarks in addition to body gestures. We demonstrate the performance of our method through thorough quantitative and qualitative experiments on multiple evaluation metrics and via a user study. We observe that our method results in low reconstruction error and produces synthesized samples with diverse facial expressions and body gestures for digital characters.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

The challenge of predicting protein functions is compounded by the limited availability of labeled data. Traditional machine learning models already struggle in such cases, and while deep learning models excel with abundant data, they also face difficulties when data is scarce. HOPER addresses this issue by integrating three distinct modalities - protein sequences, biomedical text, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks - to create a comprehensive protein representation. The model utilizes autoencoders to generate holistic embeddings, which are then employed for PFP tasks using transfer learning. HOPER outperforms existing methods on a benchmark dataset across all Gene Ontology categories, i.e., molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. Additionally, we demonstrate its practical utility by identifying new immune-escape proteins in lung adenocarcinoma, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multimodal representation learning for overcoming data limitations in biological research, potentially enabling more accurate and scalable protein function prediction.

Current bioinformatic methods struggle to handle the heterogeneous nature of this data, especially with missing modalities. We propose PARADIGM, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that learns from multimodal, heterogeneous datasets to improve clinical outcome prediction. PARADIGM generates embeddings from multi-resolution data using foundation models, aggregates them into patient-level representations, fuses them into a unified graph, and enhances performance for tasks like survival analysis. We train GNNs on pan-Squamous Cell Carcinomas and validate our approach on Moffitt Cancer Center lung SCC data. Multimodal GNN outperforms other models in patient survival prediction. Converging individual data modalities across varying scales provides a more insightful disease view.

However, this integration also brings unique safety and security challenges. In this paper, we conceptualize cybersafety and cybersecurity in the context of multimodal learning and present a comprehensive Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) to unify these concepts in MFMs, identifying key threats to these models. We propose a taxonomy framework grounded in information theory, evaluating and categorizing threats through the concepts of channel capacity, signal, noise, and bandwidth. This approach provides a novel framework that unifies model safety and system security in MFMs, offering a more comprehensive and actionable understanding of the risks involved. We used this to explore existing defense mechanisms, and identified gaps in current research - particularly, a lack of protection for alignment between modalities and a need for more systematic defense methods. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the security and safety landscape in MFMs, providing researchers and practitioners with valuable insights for improving the robustness and reliability of these models.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional approaches rely on modality-specific encoders and late fusion techniques, which can hinder scalability and flexibility when adapting to new tasks or modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that extends the concept of task reformulation beyond natural language processing (NLP) to multimodal learning. We propose to reformulate diverse multimodal tasks into a unified next-frame prediction problem, allowing a single model to handle different modalities without modality-specific components. This method treats all inputs and outputs as sequential frames in a video, enabling seamless integration of modalities and effective knowledge transfer across tasks. Our approach is evaluated on a range of tasks, including text-to-text, image-to-text, video-to-video, video-to-text, and audio-to-text, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across modalities with minimal adaptation. We show that task reformulation can significantly simplify multimodal model design across various tasks, laying the groundwork for more generalized multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures | None |

Recent research has identified new classes of "machine un-auditable" bugs that arise from both transactional contexts and source code. Existing detection methods require human understanding of underlying transaction logic and manual reasoning across different sources of context (i.e. modalities), such as code, dynamic transaction executions, and natural language specifying the expected transaction behavior. To automate the detection of ``machine un-auditable'' bugs, we present SmartInv, an accurate and fast smart contract invariant inference framework. Our key insight is that the expected behavior of smart contracts, as specified by invariants, relies on understanding and reasoning across multimodal information, such as source code and natural language. We propose a new prompting strategy to foundation models, Tier of Thought (ToT), to reason across multiple modalities of smart contracts and ultimately to generate invariants. By checking the violation of these generated invariants, SmartInv can identify potential vulnerabilities. We evaluate SmartInv on real-world contracts and re-discover bugs that resulted in multi-million dollar losses over the past 2.5 years (from January 1, 2021 to May 31, 2023). Our extensive evaluation shows that SmartInv generates (3.5X) more bug-critical invariants and detects (4$\times$) more critical bugs compared to the state-of-the-art tools in significantly (150X) less time. \sys uncovers 119 zero-day vulnerabilities from the 89,621 real-world contracts. Among them, five are critical zero-day bugs confirmed by developers as ``high severity.''</p></details> |  | None |

Through the correspondences, a cohesive user interface is automatically constructed from pairwise designs. To achieve high-fidelity effects, we introduce a universal data protocol for precise design descriptions and cross-platform applications. We also develop an interactive web-based tool for game developers to facilitate the use of our system. We create a game UI dataset from actual game projects and combine it with a public dataset for training and evaluation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in maintaining coherence between the constructed interfaces and the original designs.</p></details> | 27 pages | None |

Since multimodal data changes in open environments, dynamic fusion has emerged and achieved remarkable progress in numerous applications. However, most existing dynamic multimodal fusion methods lack theoretical guarantees and easily fall into suboptimal problems, yielding unreliability and instability. To address this issue, we propose a Predictive Dynamic Fusion (PDF) framework for multimodal learning. We proceed to reveal the multimodal fusion from a generalization perspective and theoretically derive the predictable Collaborative Belief (Co-Belief) with Mono- and Holo-Confidence, which provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Accordingly, we further propose a relative calibration strategy to calibrate the predicted Co-Belief for potential uncertainty. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm our superiority.

However, during the multimodal training process, the model tends to rely on only one modality based on which it could learn faster, thus leading to inadequate use of other modalities. Existing methods to balance the training process always have some limitations on the loss functions, optimizers and the number of modalities and only consider modulating the magnitude of the gradients while ignoring the directions of the gradients. To solve these problems, in this paper, we present a novel method to balance multimodal learning with Classifier-Guided Gradient Modulation (CGGM), considering both the magnitude and directions of the gradients. We conduct extensive experiments on four multimodal datasets: UPMC-Food 101, CMU-MOSI, IEMOCAP and BraTS 2021, covering classification, regression and segmentation tasks.

We compare three modality fusion strategies in person identification and verification by processing two modalities: voice and face. In this paper, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed for x-vector extraction from voice, while the pre-trained VGGFace2 network and transfer learning are utilized for face modality. In addition, gammatonegram is used as speech representation in engagement with the Darknet19 pre-trained network. The proposed systems are evaluated using the K-fold cross-validation technique on the 118 speakers of the test set of the VoxCeleb2 dataset. The comparative evaluations are done for single-modality and three proposed multimodal strategies in equal situations. Results demonstrate that the feature fusion strategy of gammatonegram and facial features achieves the highest performance, with an accuracy of 98.37% in the person identification task.

Additionally, the modality gap between time series data and textual information poses a challenge for multimodal learning.

| **[Analyzing Multimodal Integration in the Variational Autoencoder from an Information-Theoretic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00522v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human perception is inherently multimodal. We integrate, for instance, visual, proprioceptive and tactile information into one experience. Hence, multimodal learning is of importance for building robotic systems that aim at robustly interacting with the real world. One potential model that has been proposed for multimodal integration is the multimodal variational autoencoder. A variational autoencoder (VAE) consists of two networks, an encoder that maps the data to a stochastic latent space and a decoder that reconstruct this data from an element of this latent space. The multimodal VAE integrates inputs from different modalities at two points in time in the latent space and can thereby be used as a controller for a robotic agent. Here we use this architecture and introduce information-theoretic measures in order to analyze how important the integration of the different modalities are for the reconstruction of the input data. Therefore we calculate two different types of measures, the first type is called single modality error and assesses how important the information from a single modality is for the reconstruction of this modality or all modalities. Secondly, the measures named loss of precision calculate the impact that missing information from only one modality has on the reconstruction of this modality or the whole vector. The VAE is trained via the evidence lower bound, which can be written as a sum of two different terms, namely the reconstruction and the latent loss. The impact of the latent loss can be weighted via an additional variable, which has been introduced to combat posterior collapse. Here we train networks with four different weighting schedules and analyze them with respect to their capabilities for multimodal integration.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed LNLN features a dominant modality correction (DMC) module and dominant modality based multimodal learning (DMML) module, which enhances the model's robustness across various noise scenarios by ensuring the quality of dominant modality representations. Aside from the methodical design, we perform comprehensive experiments under random data missing scenarios, utilizing diverse and meaningful settings on several popular datasets (\textit{e.g.,} MOSI, MOSEI, and SIMS), providing additional uniformity, transparency, and fairness compared to existing evaluations in the literature.

However, in scenarios where some modalities are missing, many existing frameworks struggle to accommodate arbitrary modality combinations, often relying heavily on a single modality or complete data. This oversight of potential modality combinations limits their applicability in real-world situations. To address this challenge, we propose Flex-MoE (Flexible Mixture-of-Experts), a new framework designed to flexibly incorporate arbitrary modality combinations while maintaining robustness to missing data. The core idea of Flex-MoE is to first address missing modalities using a new missing modality bank that integrates observed modality combinations with the corresponding missing ones. This is followed by a uniquely designed Sparse MoE framework. Specifically, Flex-MoE first trains experts using samples with all modalities to inject generalized knowledge through the generalized router ($\mathcal{G}$-Router). The $\mathcal{S}$-Router then specializes in handling fewer modality combinations by assigning the top-1 gate to the expert corresponding to the observed modality combination. We evaluate Flex-MoE on the ADNI dataset, which encompasses four modalities in the Alzheimer's Disease domain, as well as on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Flex-MoE highlighting its ability to model arbitrary modality combinations in diverse missing modality scenarios.

Our framework is designed to flexibly handle varying input sizes, while dynamically adjusting attention to account for feature importance across modalities. We evaluate our approach on a recently introduced emotion recognition dataset that combines data from three modalities, making it an ideal testbed for multimodal learning.

However, in critical applications like aerial perception, it is essential for DNNs to maintain consistent reliability across all conditions, including low-light scenarios where EO cameras often struggle to capture sufficient detail. Additionally, UAV-based aerial object detection faces significant challenges due to scale variability from varying altitudes and slant angles, adding another layer of complexity. Existing methods typically address only illumination changes or style variations as domain shifts, but in aerial perception, correlation shifts also impact DNN performance. In this paper, we introduce the IndraEye dataset, a multi-sensor (EO-IR) dataset designed for various tasks. It includes 5,612 images with 145,666 instances, encompassing multiple viewing angles, altitudes, seven backgrounds, and different times of the day across the Indian subcontinent. The dataset opens up several research opportunities, such as multimodal learning, domain adaptation for object detection and segmentation, and exploration of sensor-specific strengths and weaknesses.

Vript addresses this issue with a meticulously annotated corpus of 12K high-resolution videos, offering detailed, dense, and script-like captions for over 420K clips. Each clip has a caption of ~145 words, which is over 10x longer than most video-text datasets. Unlike captions only documenting static content in previous datasets, we enhance video captioning to video scripting by documenting not just the content, but also the camera operations, which include the shot types (medium shot, close-up, etc) and camera movements (panning, tilting, etc). By utilizing the Vript, we explore three training paradigms of aligning more text with the video modality rather than clip-caption pairs. This results in Vriptor, a top-performing video captioning model among open-source models, comparable to GPT-4V in performance. Vriptor is also a powerful model capable of end-to-end generation of dense and detailed captions for long videos. Moreover, we introduce Vript-Hard, a benchmark consisting of three video understanding tasks that are more challenging than existing benchmarks: Vript-HAL is the first benchmark evaluating action and object hallucinations in video LLMs, Vript-RR combines reasoning with retrieval resolving question ambiguity in long-video QAs, and Vript-ERO is a new task to evaluate the temporal understanding of events in long videos rather than actions in short videos in previous works.

However, data inputs in other domains, such as the medical field, may include X-rays, PET scans, MRIs, genetic screening, clinical notes, and more, creating a need for both efficient and accurate information fusion. Many state-of-the-art models rely on pairwise cross-modal attention, which does not scale well for applications with more than three modalities. For $n$ modalities, computing attention will result in $n \choose 2$ operations, potentially requiring considerable amounts of computational resources. To address this, we propose a new domain-neutral attention mechanism, One-Versus-Others (OvO) attention, that scales linearly with the number of modalities and requires only $n$ attention operations, thus offering a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to existing cross-modal attention algorithms. Using three diverse real-world datasets as well as an additional simulation experiment, we show that our method improves performance compared to popular fusion techniques while decreasing computation costs.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Resource-Efficient Federated Multimodal Learning via Layer-wise and Progressive Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15426v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining different data modalities enables deep neural networks to tackle complex tasks more effectively, making multimodal learning increasingly popular. To harness multimodal data closer to end users, it is essential to integrate multimodal learning with privacy-preserving approaches like federated learning (FL). However, compared to conventional unimodal learning, multimodal setting requires dedicated encoders for each modality, resulting in larger and more complex models. Training these models requires significant resources, presenting a substantial challenge for FL clients operating with limited computation and communication resources. To address these challenges, we introduce LW-FedMML, a layer-wise federated multimodal learning approach which decomposes the training process into multiple stages. Each stage focuses on training only a portion of the model, thereby significantly reducing the memory and computational requirements. Moreover, FL clients only need to exchange the trained model portion with the central server, lowering the resulting communication cost. We conduct extensive experiments across various FL and multimodal learning settings to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results demonstrate that LW-FedMML can compete with conventional end-to-end federated multimodal learning (FedMML) while significantly reducing the resource burden on FL clients. Specifically, LW-FedMML reduces memory usage by up to $2.7\times$, computational operations (FLOPs) by $2.4\times$, and total communication cost by $2.3\times$. We also explore a progressive training approach called Prog-FedMML. While it offers lesser resource efficiency than LW-FedMML, Prog-FedMML has the potential to surpass the performance of end-to-end FedMML, making it a viable option for scenarios with fewer resource constraints.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multimodal Learning for Embryo Viability Prediction in Clinical IVF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15581v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In clinical In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF), identifying the most viable embryo for transfer is important to increasing the likelihood of a successful pregnancy. Traditionally, this process involves embryologists manually assessing embryos' static morphological features at specific intervals using light microscopy. This manual evaluation is not only time-intensive and costly, due to the need for expert analysis, but also inherently subjective, leading to variability in the selection process. To address these challenges, we develop a multimodal model that leverages both time-lapse video data and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to predict embryo viability. One of the primary challenges of our research is to effectively combine time-lapse video and EHR data, owing to their inherent differences in modality. We comprehensively analyze our multimodal model with various modality inputs and integration approaches. Our approach will enable fast and automated embryo viability predictions in scale for clinical IVF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2024</p></details> | None |

Previous works have shown promising results in augmenting datasets by generating synthetic samples. However, they only support domain-specific ad hoc use cases (e.g., either image or text only, but not both), and are limited in data diversity due to a lack of fine-grained control over the synthesis process. In this paper, we design a \emph{controllable} image-text synthesis pipeline, CtrlSynth, for data-efficient and robust multimodal learning. The key idea is to decompose the visual semantics of an image into basic elements, apply user-specified control policies (e.g., remove, add, or replace operations), and recompose them to synthesize images or texts. The decompose and recompose feature in CtrlSynth allows users to control data synthesis in a fine-grained manner by defining customized control policies to manipulate the basic elements. CtrlSynth leverages the capabilities of pretrained foundation models such as large language models or diffusion models to reason and recompose basic elements such that synthetic samples are natural and composed in diverse ways. CtrlSynth is a closed-loop, training-free, and modular framework, making it easy to support different pretrained models. With extensive experiments on 31 datasets spanning different vision and vision-language tasks, we show that CtrlSynth substantially improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and compositional reasoning performance of CLIP models.</p></details> |  | None |

Among other approaches, learning-based warm-starting represents an appealing paradigm for solving the trajectory generation problem, effectively combining the benefits of optimization- and data-driven methods. Current approaches for learning-based trajectory generation often focus on fixed, single-scenario environments, where key scene characteristics, such as obstacle positions or final-time requirements, remain constant across problem instances. However, practical trajectory generation requires the scenario to be frequently reconfigured, making the single-scenario approach a potentially impractical solution. To address this challenge, we present a novel trajectory generation framework that generalizes across diverse problem configurations, by leveraging high-capacity transformer neural networks capable of learning from multimodal data sources. Specifically, our approach integrates transformer-based neural network models into the trajectory optimization process, encoding both scene-level information (e.g., obstacle locations, initial and goal states) and trajectory-level constraints (e.g., time bounds, fuel consumption targets) via multimodal representations. The transformer network then generates near-optimal initial guesses for non-convex optimization problems, significantly enhancing convergence speed and performance. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a free-flyer platform, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 80% reduction in infeasible cases with respect to traditional approaches, and demonstrating robust generalization across diverse scenario variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to 2025 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> | None |
| **[On-the-fly Modulation for Balanced Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11582v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning is expected to boost model performance by integrating information from different modalities. However, its potential is not fully exploited because the widely-used joint training strategy, which has a uniform objective for all modalities, leads to imbalanced and under-optimized uni-modal representations. Specifically, we point out that there often exists modality with more discriminative information, e.g., vision of playing football and sound of blowing wind. They could dominate the joint training process, resulting in other modalities being significantly under-optimized. To alleviate this problem, we first analyze the under-optimized phenomenon from both the feed-forward and the back-propagation stages during optimization. Then, On-the-fly Prediction Modulation (OPM) and On-the-fly Gradient Modulation (OGM) strategies are proposed to modulate the optimization of each modality, by monitoring the discriminative discrepancy between modalities during training. Concretely, OPM weakens the influence of the dominant modality by dropping its feature with dynamical probability in the feed-forward stage, while OGM mitigates its gradient in the back-propagation stage. In experiments, our methods demonstrate considerable improvement across a variety of multimodal tasks. These simple yet effective strategies not only enhance performance in vanilla and task-oriented multimodal models, but also in more complex multimodal tasks, showcasing their effectiveness and flexibility.

| **[Improving Multimodal Learning with Multi-Loss Gradient Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07930v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from multiple modalities, such as audio and video, offers opportunities for leveraging complementary information, enhancing robustness, and improving contextual understanding and performance. However, combining such modalities presents challenges, especially when modalities differ in data structure, predictive contribution, and the complexity of their learning processes. It has been observed that one modality can potentially dominate the learning process, hindering the effective utilization of information from other modalities and leading to sub-optimal model performance. To address this issue the vast majority of previous works suggest to assess the unimodal contributions and dynamically adjust the training to equalize them. We improve upon previous work by introducing a multi-loss objective and further refining the balancing process, allowing it to dynamically adjust the learning pace of each modality in both directions, acceleration and deceleration, with the ability to phase out balancing effects upon convergence. We achieve superior results across three audio-video datasets: on CREMA-D, models with ResNet backbone encoders surpass the previous best by 1.9% to 12.4%, and Conformer backbone models deliver improvements ranging from 2.8% to 14.1% across different fusion methods. On AVE, improvements range from 2.7% to 7.7%, while on UCF101, gains reach up to 6.1%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Data-to-Product Multimodal Conceptual Framework to Achieve Automated Software Evolution for Context-rich Intelligent Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04821v5)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While AI is extensively transforming Software Engineering (SE) fields, SE is still in need of a framework to overall consider all phases to facilitate Automated Software Evolution (ASEv), particularly for intelligent applications that are context-rich, instead of conquering each division independently. Its complexity comes from the intricacy of the intelligent applications, the heterogeneity of the data sources, and the constant changes in the context. This study proposes a conceptual framework for achieving automated software evolution, emphasizing the importance of multimodality learning. A Selective Sequential Scope Model (3S) model is developed based on the conceptual framework, and it can be used to categorize existing and future research when it covers different SE phases and multimodal learning tasks. This research is a preliminary step toward the blueprint of a higher-level ASEv. The proposed conceptual framework can act as a practical guideline for practitioners to prepare themselves for diving into this area. Although the study is about intelligent applications, the framework and analysis methods may be adapted for other types of software as AI brings more intelligence into their life cycles.</p></details> |  | None |

We evaluate AutoBIND on Alzhiemer's disease detection because it has real-world medical applicability and it contains a broad range of data modalities. We show that AutoBIND outperforms previous methods on this task, highlighting the generalizablility of the approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MMP: Towards Robust Multi-Modal Learning with Masked Modality Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03010v2)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning seeks to combine data from multiple input sources to enhance the performance of different downstream tasks. In real-world scenarios, performance can degrade substantially if some input modalities are missing. Existing methods that can handle missing modalities involve custom training or adaptation steps for each input modality combination. These approaches are either tied to specific modalities or become computationally expensive as the number of input modalities increases. In this paper, we propose Masked Modality Projection (MMP), a method designed to train a single model that is robust to any missing modality scenario. We achieve this by randomly masking a subset of modalities during training and learning to project available input modalities to estimate the tokens for the masked modalities. This approach enables the model to effectively learn to leverage the information from the available modalities to compensate for the missing ones, enhancing missing modality robustness. We conduct a series of experiments with various baseline models and datasets to assess the effectiveness of this strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves robustness to different missing modality scenarios, outperforming existing methods designed for missing modalities or specific modality combinations.</p></details> |  | None |

It is desirable for redundancies in the data to make multimodal systems robust to missing or corrupted observations in some correlated modalities. However, we observe that the performance of several existing multimodal networks significantly deteriorates if one or multiple modalities are absent at test time. To enable robustness to missing modalities, we propose a simple and parameter-efficient adaptation procedure for pretrained multimodal networks. In particular, we exploit modulation of intermediate features to compensate for the missing modalities. We demonstrate that such adaptation can partially bridge performance drop due to missing modalities and outperform independent, dedicated networks trained for the available modality combinations in some cases. The proposed adaptation requires extremely small number of parameters (e.g., fewer than 1% of the total parameters) and applicable to a wide range of modality combinations and tasks. We conduct a series of experiments to highlight the missing modality robustness of our proposed method on five different multimodal tasks across seven datasets. Our proposed method demonstrates versatility across various tasks and datasets, and outperforms existing methods for robust multimodal learning with missing modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). 28 pages, 6 figures, 17 tables</p></details> | None |

Addressing these adversarial vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing security in multimodal learning. Traditionally, adversarial methods targeting VLP models involve simultaneously perturbing images and text. However, this approach faces notable challenges: first, adversarial perturbations often fail to translate effectively into real-world scenarios; second, direct modifications to the text are conspicuously visible. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel strategy that exclusively employs image patches for attacks, thus preserving the integrity of the original text. Our method leverages prior knowledge from diffusion models to enhance the authenticity and naturalness of the perturbations. Moreover, to optimize patch placement and improve the efficacy of our attacks, we utilize the cross-attention mechanism, which encapsulates intermodal interactions by generating attention maps to guide strategic patch placements. Comprehensive experiments conducted in a white-box setting for image-to-text scenarios reveal that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing techniques, achieving a 100% attack success rate. Additionally, it demonstrates commendable performance in transfer tasks involving text-to-image configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Visual Intelligence</p></details> | None |

However, recent studies have identified that the information loss in the CLIP encoding process is substantial, and CLIP tends to capture only coarse-grained features from the input. This deficiency significantly limits the ability of a single CLIP model to handle images rich in visual detail. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic strategy, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (DMU), for CLIP. DMU efficiently fine-tunes a series of CLIP models that capture different feature spaces, from a dense pre-trained CLIP checkpoint, sharing parameters except for the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These models can then be transformed into a CLIP-MoE with a larger model capacity, leading to significantly enhanced performance with minimal computational overhead. To the best of our knowledge, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling is the first approach to introduce sparsely activated MoE into CLIP foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance of CLIP-MoE across various zero-shot retrieval, zero-shot image classification tasks, and downstream Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks by serving as a vision encoder. Furthermore, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling enables the conversion of any dense CLIP model into CLIP-MoEs, which can seamlessly replace CLIP in a plug-and-play manner without requiring further adaptation in downstream frameworks. Through Diversified Multiplet Upcycling, we aim to provide valuable insights for future research on developing more efficient and effective multimodal learning systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multilingual Diversity Improves Vision-Language Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16915v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight paper</p></details> | None |

Therefore, the performance of CF algorithms degrades when few or no interactions are available, a scenario referred to as cold-start. To address this issue, previous work relies on models leveraging both collaborative data and side information on the users or items. Similar to multimodal learning, these models aim at combining collaborative and content representations in a shared embedding space. In this work we propose a novel technique for multimodal recommendation, relying on a multimodal Single-Branch embedding network for Recommendation (SiBraR). Leveraging weight-sharing, SiBraR encodes interaction data as well as multimodal side information using the same single-branch embedding network on different modalities. This makes SiBraR effective in scenarios of missing modality, including cold start. Our extensive experiments on large-scale recommendation datasets from three different recommendation domains (music, movie, and e-commerce) and providing multimodal content information (audio, text, image, labels, and interactions) show that SiBraR significantly outperforms CF as well as state-of-the-art content-based RSs in cold-start scenarios, and is competitive in warm scenarios. We show that SiBraR's recommendations are accurate in missing modality scenarios, and that the model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared embedding space, hence reducing the modality gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 18th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys '24)</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces an innovative approach to feature alignment that revolutionizes the fusion of multimodal information. Our method employs a novel iterative process of telescopic displacement and expansion of feature representations across different modalities, culminating in a coherent unified representation within a shared feature space. This sophisticated technique demonstrates a remarkable ability to capture and leverage complex crossmodal interactions at the highest levels of abstraction. As a result, we observe significant enhancements in the performance of multimodal learning tasks. Through rigorous comparative analysis, we establish the superiority of our approach over existing multimodal fusion paradigms across a diverse array of applications. Comprehensive empirical evaluations conducted on multifaceted datasets encompassing temporal sequences, visual data, and textual information provide compelling evidence that our method achieves unprecedented benchmarks in the field. This work not only advances the state of the art in multimodal learning but also opens new avenues for exploring the synergies between disparate data modalities in complex analytical scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figures | None |

For intelligent agents, the state is a crucial modality to convey precise information alongside common modalities like images, videos, and language. This becomes especially clear with the broad adoption of reinforcement learning and multimodal large language models. Nevertheless, the representation of state modality still lags in development. To this end, we propose a High-Fidelity Contrastive Language-State Pre-training (CLSP) method, which can accurately encode state information into general representations for both reinforcement learning and multimodal large language models. Specifically, we first design a pre-training task based on the classification to train an encoder with coarse-grained information. Next, we construct data pairs of states and language descriptions, utilizing the pre-trained encoder to initialize the CLSP encoder. Then, we deploy contrastive learning to train the CLSP encoder to effectively represent precise state information. Additionally, we enhance the representation of numerical information using the Random Fourier Features (RFF) method for high-fidelity mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior precision and generalization capabilities of our representation, achieving outstanding results in text-state retrieval, reinforcement learning navigation tasks, and multimodal large language model understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Current VQA models struggle with complex questions due to limitations in capturing and integrating multimodal information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Rank VQA model, which leverages a ranking-inspired hybrid training strategy to enhance VQA performance. The Rank VQA model integrates high-quality visual features extracted using the Faster R-CNN model and rich semantic text features obtained from a pre-trained BERT model. These features are fused through a sophisticated multimodal fusion technique employing multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Additionally, a ranking learning module is incorporated to optimize the relative ranking of answers, thus improving answer accuracy. The hybrid training strategy combines classification and ranking losses, enhancing the model's generalization ability and robustness across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Rank VQA model. Our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on standard VQA datasets, including VQA v2.0 and COCO-QA, in terms of both accuracy and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The superior performance of Rank VQA is evident in its ability to handle complex questions that require understanding nuanced details and making sophisticated inferences from the image and text. This work highlights the effectiveness of a ranking-based hybrid training strategy in improving VQA performance and lays the groundwork for further research in multimodal learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Visua...</summary><p>Visual Question Answering, Rank VQA, Faster R-CNN, BERT, Multimodal Fusion, Ranking Learning, Hybrid Training Strategy</p></details> | None |

Here we introduce the all-in-one (AIO) ANI model architecture based on multimodal learning which can learn an arbitrary number of QC levels. Our all-in-one learning approach offers a more general and easier-to-use alternative to transfer learning. We use it to train the AIO-ANI-UIP foundational model with the generalization capability comparable to semi-empirical GFN2-xTB and DFT with a double-zeta basis set for organic molecules.

The presented Multiscale Encoder-Decoder Video Transformer (MED-VT) uses multiscale representation throughout and employs an optional input beyond video (e.g., audio), when available, for multimodal processing (MED-VT++). Multiscale representation at both encoder and decoder yields three key benefits: (i) implicit extraction of spatiotemporal features at different levels of abstraction for capturing dynamics without reliance on input optical flow, (ii) temporal consistency at encoding and (iii) coarse-to-fine detection for high-level (e.g., object) semantics to guide precise localization at decoding. Moreover, we present a transductive learning scheme through many-to-many label propagation to provide temporally consistent video predictions. We showcase MED-VT/MED-VT++ on three unimodal video segmentation tasks (Automatic Video Object Segmentation (AVOS), actor-action segmentation and Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS)) as well as a multimodal segmentation task (Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS)). Results show that the proposed architecture outperforms alternative state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks using only video (and optional audio) as input, without reliance on optical flow. Finally, to document details of the model's internal learned representations, we present a detailed interpretability study, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of CVPR'23 paper for journal submission</p></details> | None |

However, unlike object detection in natural scene images, this task is particularly challenging due to the abundance of small, often barely visible objects across diverse terrains. To address these challenges, multimodal learning can be used to integrate features from different data modalities, thereby improving detection accuracy. Nonetheless, the performance of multimodal learning is often constrained by the limited size of labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose to use Masked Image Modeling (MIM) as a pre-training technique, leveraging self-supervised learning on unlabeled data to enhance detection performance. However, conventional MIM such as MAE which uses masked tokens without any contextual information, struggles to capture the fine-grained details due to a lack of interactions with other parts of image. To address this, we propose a new interactive MIM method that can establish interactions between different tokens, which is particularly beneficial for object detection in remote sensing. The extensive ablation studies and evluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Therefore, most works rely on multimodal labels for training. However, there exists the noisy label problem for the learning of unimodal signals as multimodal annotations are not always the ideal substitutes for the unimodal ones, failing to achieve finer optimization for individual modalities. In this paper, we explore the learning of unimodal labels under the weak supervision from the annotated multimodal labels. Specifically, we propose a novel meta uni-label generation (MUG) framework to address the above problem, which leverages the available multimodal labels to learn the corresponding unimodal labels by the meta uni-label correction network (MUCN). We first design a contrastive-based projection module to bridge the gap between unimodal and multimodal representations, so as to use multimodal annotations to guide the learning of MUCN. Afterwards, we propose unimodal and multimodal denoising tasks to train MUCN with explicit supervision via a bi-level optimization strategy. We then jointly train unimodal and multimodal learning tasks to extract discriminative unimodal features for multimodal inference.

Contrastive loss - an objective matching related samples - underlies methods from self-supervised to multimodal learning. Contrastive losses, however, can be viewed more broadly as modifying a similarity graph to indicate how samples should relate in the embedding space. This view reveals a shortcoming in contrastive learning: the similarity graph is binary, as only one sample is the related positive sample. Crucially, similarities \textit{across} samples are ignored. Based on this observation, we revise the standard contrastive loss to explicitly encode how a sample relates to others. We experiment with this new objective, called $\mathbb{X}$-Sample Contrastive, to train vision models based on similarities in class or text caption descriptions. Our study spans three scales: ImageNet-1k with 1 million, CC3M with 3 million, and CC12M with 12 million samples. The representations learned via our objective outperform both contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models trained on the same data across a range of tasks. When training on CC12M, we outperform CLIP by $0.6\%$ on both ImageNet and ImageNet Real. Our objective appears to work particularly well in lower-data regimes, with gains over CLIP of $16.8\%$ on ImageNet and $18.1\%$ on ImageNet Real when training with CC3M. Finally, our objective seems to encourage the model to learn representations that separate objects from their attributes and backgrounds, with gains of $3.3$-$5.6$\% over CLIP on ImageNet9. We hope the proposed solution takes a small step towards developing richer learning objectives for understanding sample relations in foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Multimodal composite retrieval integrates diverse modalities such as text, image and audio, etc. to provide more accurate, personalized, and contextually relevant results. To facilitate a deeper understanding of this promising direction, this survey explores multimodal composite editing and retrieval in depth, covering image-text composite editing, image-text composite retrieval, and other multimodal composite retrieval.

Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust Semi-supervised Multimodal Medical Image Segmentation via Cross Modality Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07341v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning leverages complementary information derived from different modalities, thereby enhancing performance in medical image segmentation. However, prevailing multimodal learning methods heavily rely on extensive well-annotated data from various modalities to achieve accurate segmentation performance. This dependence often poses a challenge in clinical settings due to limited availability of such data. Moreover, the inherent anatomical misalignment between different imaging modalities further complicates the endeavor to enhance segmentation performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised multimodal segmentation framework that is robust to scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities. Our framework employs a novel cross modality collaboration strategy to distill modality-independent knowledge, which is inherently associated with each modality, and integrates this information into a unified fusion layer for feature amalgamation. With a channel-wise semantic consistency loss, our framework ensures alignment of modality-independent information from a feature-wise perspective across modalities, thereby fortifying it against misalignments in multimodal scenarios. Furthermore, our framework effectively integrates contrastive consistent learning to regulate anatomical structures, facilitating anatomical-wise prediction alignment on unlabeled data in semi-supervised segmentation tasks. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other multimodal methods across three tasks: cardiac, abdominal multi-organ, and thyroid-associated orbitopathy segmentations. It also demonstrates outstanding robustness in scenarios involving scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities.</p></details> |  | None |

This comprehensive review examines state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models and foundation models in music, spanning from representation learning, generative learning and multimodal learning. We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues. The paper offers insights into future challenges and trends on FMs for music, aiming to shape the trajectory of human-AI collaboration in the music realm.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[CILF-CIAE: CLIP-driven Image-Language Fusion for Correcting Inverse Age Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01758v3)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The age estimation task aims to predict the age of an individual by analyzing facial features in an image. The development of age estimation can improve the efficiency and accuracy of various applications (e.g., age verification and secure access control, etc.). In recent years, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) has been widely used in various multimodal tasks and has made some progress in the field of age estimation. However, existing CLIP-based age estimation methods require high memory usage (quadratic complexity) when globally modeling images, and lack an error feedback mechanism to prompt the model about the quality of age prediction results. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel CLIP-driven Image-Language Fusion for Correcting Inverse Age Estimation (CILF-CIAE). Specifically, we first introduce the CLIP model to extract image features and text semantic information respectively, and map them into a highly semantically aligned high-dimensional feature space. Next, we designed a new Transformer architecture (i.e., FourierFormer) to achieve channel evolution and spatial interaction of images, and to fuse image and text semantic information. Compared with the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, the proposed Fourierformer is of linear log complexity. To further narrow the semantic gap between image and text features, we utilize an efficient contrastive multimodal learning module that supervises the multimodal fusion process of FourierFormer through contrastive loss for image-text matching, thereby improving the interaction effect between different modalities. Finally, we introduce reversible age estimation, which uses end-to-end error feedback to reduce the error rate of age predictions. Through extensive experiments on multiple data sets, CILF-CIAE has achieved better age prediction results.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

It is particularly prevalent in audiovisual learning, with audio is often assumed to be the weaker modality in recognition tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce ModalityMirror to improve audio model performance by leveraging knowledge distillation from an audiovisual federated learning model. ModalityMirror involves two phases: a modality-wise FL stage to aggregate uni-modal encoders; and a federated knowledge distillation stage on multi-modality clients to train an unimodal student model. Our results demonstrate that ModalityMirror significantly improves the audio classification compared to the state-of-the-art FL methods such as Harmony, particularly in audiovisual FL facing video missing. Our approach unlocks the potential for exploiting the diverse modality spectrum inherent in multi-modal FL.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing CV models often suffer a significant decrease in accuracy when confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In contrast to these DNN models, human can maintain a consistently low error rate when facing OOD scenes, partly attributed to the rich prior cognitive knowledge stored in the human brain. Previous OOD generalization researches only focus on the single modal, overlooking the advantages of multimodal learning method. In this paper, we utilize the multimodal learning method to improve the OOD generalization and propose a novel Brain-machine Fusion Learning (BMFL) framework. We adopt the cross-attention mechanism to fuse the visual knowledge from CV model and prior cognitive knowledge from the human brain. Specially, we employ a pre-trained visual neural encoding model to predict the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) from visual features which eliminates the need for the fMRI data collection and pre-processing, effectively reduces the workload associated with conventional BMFL methods. Furthermore, we construct a brain transformer to facilitate the extraction of knowledge inside the fMRI data. Moreover, we introduce the Pearson correlation coefficient maximization regularization method into the training process, which improves the fusion capability with better constrains. Our model outperforms the DINOv2 and baseline models on the ImageNet-1k validation dataset as well as six curated OOD datasets, showcasing its superior performance in diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multimodal Ensemble with Conditional Feature Fusion for Dysgraphia Diagnosis in Children from Handwriting Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13754v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developmental dysgraphia is a neurological disorder that hinders children's writing skills. In recent years, researchers have increasingly explored machine learning methods to support the diagnosis of dysgraphia based on offline and online handwriting. In most previous studies, the two types of handwriting have been analysed separately, which does not necessarily lead to promising results. In this way, the relationship between online and offline data cannot be explored. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal machine learning approach utilizing both online and offline handwriting data. We created a new dataset by transforming an existing online handwritten dataset, generating corresponding offline handwriting images. We considered only different types of word data (simple word, pseudoword & difficult word) in our multimodal analysis. We trained SVM and XGBoost classifiers separately on online and offline features as well as implemented multimodal feature fusion and soft-voted ensemble. Furthermore, we proposed a novel ensemble with conditional feature fusion method which intelligently combines predictions from online and offline classifiers, selectively incorporating feature fusion when confidence scores fall below a threshold. Our novel approach achieves an accuracy of 88.8%, outperforming SVMs for single modalities by 12-14%, existing methods by 8-9%, and traditional multimodal approaches (soft-vote ensemble and feature fusion) by 3% and 5%, respectively. Our methodology contributes to the development of accurate and efficient dysgraphia diagnosis tools, requiring only a single instance of multimodal word/pseudoword data to determine the handwriting impairment. This work highlights the potential of multimodal learning in enhancing dysgraphia diagnosis, paving the way for accessible and practical diagnostic tools.</p></details> |  | None |

As a vital technology, multimodal learning has increasingly garnered interest due to data complementarity, comprehensive modeling form, and great application potential. Currently, numerous researchers are dedicating their attention to this field, conducting extensive studies and constructing abundant intelligent systems. Naturally, an open question arises that has multimodal learning delivered universal intelligence in healthcare? To answer the question, we adopt three unique viewpoints for a holistic analysis. Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the current progress of medical multimodal learning from the perspectives of datasets, task-oriented methods, and universal foundation models. Based on them, we further discuss the proposed question from five issues to explore the real impacts of advanced techniques in healthcare, from data and technologies to performance and ethics. The answer is that current technologies have NOT achieved universal intelligence and there remains a significant journey to undertake. Finally, in light of the above reviews and discussions, we point out ten potential directions for exploration towards the goal of universal intelligence in healthcare.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures | None |

While previous reviews have focused on parts of the multimodal pipeline (e.g., conceptual models and data fusion), a comprehensive literature review on the methods informing multimodal learning and training environments has not been conducted. This literature review provides an in-depth analysis of research methods in these environments, proposing a taxonomy and framework that encapsulates recent methodological advances in this field and characterizes the multimodal domain in terms of five modality groups: Natural Language, Video, Sensors, Human-Centered, and Environment Logs. We introduce a novel data fusion category -- mid fusion -- and a graph-based technique for refining literature reviews, termed citation graph pruning. Our analysis reveals that leveraging multiple modalities offers a more holistic understanding of the behaviors and outcomes of learners and trainees. Even when multimodality does not enhance predictive accuracy, it often uncovers patterns that contextualize and elucidate unimodal data, revealing subtleties that a single modality may miss. However, there remains a need for further research to bridge the divide between multimodal learning and training studies and foundational AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM Computing Surveys.

However, traditional Transformer architectures incur significant overhead due to their secondary computational complexity. To address this issue, we introduce ML-Mamba, a multimodal language model, which utilizes the latest and efficient Mamba-2 model for inference. Mamba-2 is known for its linear scalability and fast processing of long sequences. We replace the Transformer-based backbone with a pre-trained Mamba-2 model and explore methods for integrating 2D visual selective scanning mechanisms into multimodal learning while also trying various visual encoders and Mamba-2 model variants. Our extensive experiments in various multimodal benchmark tests demonstrate the competitive performance of ML-Mamba and highlight the potential of state space models in multimodal tasks. The experimental results show that: (1) we empirically explore how to effectively apply the 2D vision selective scan mechanism for multimodal learning. We propose a novel multimodal connector called the Mamba-2 Scan Connector (MSC), which enhances representational capabilities. (2) ML-Mamba achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as TinyLaVA and MobileVLM v2 through its linear sequential modeling while faster inference speed; (3) Compared to multimodal models utilizing Mamba-1, the Mamba-2-based ML-Mamba exhibits superior inference performance and effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, presenting considerable security risks. This paper introduces Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), a novel technique to enhance the adversarial robustness of image encoders in VLMs. AdvPT innovatively leverages learnable text prompts and aligns them with adversarial image embeddings, to address the vulnerabilities inherent in VLMs without the need for extensive parameter training or modification of the model architecture. We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiamingzhang94/Adversarial-Prompt-Tuning.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | [Code Link](https://github.com/jiamingzhang94/Adversarial-Prompt-Tuning) |

However, the heavy dependence on data paired with expensive human annotations impedes scaling up models. Meanwhile, given the availability of large-scale unannotated data in the wild, self-supervised learning has become an attractive strategy to alleviate the annotation bottleneck. Building on these two directions, self-supervised multimodal learning (SSML) provides ways to learn from raw multimodal data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in SSML, in which we elucidate three major challenges intrinsic to self-supervised learning with multimodal data: (1) learning representations from multimodal data without labels, (2) fusion of different modalities, and (3) learning with unaligned data. We then detail existing solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we consider (1) objectives for learning from multimodal unlabeled data via self-supervision, (2) model architectures from the perspective of different multimodal fusion strategies, and (3) pair-free learning strategies for coarse-grained and fine-grained alignment. We also review real-world applications of SSML algorithms in diverse fields such as healthcare, remote sensing, and machine translation. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions for SSML.

Existing multimodal networks are designed in a multi-branch fashion that, due to the reliance on fusion strategies, exhibit deteriorated performance if one or more modalities are missing. In this work, we propose a modality invariant multimodal learning method, which is less susceptible to the impact of missing modalities. It consists of a single-branch network sharing weights across multiple modalities to learn inter-modality representations to maximize performance as well as robustness to missing modalities. Extensive experiments are performed on four challenging datasets including textual-visual (UPMC Food-101, Hateful Memes, Ferramenta) and audio-visual modalities (VoxCeleb1). Our proposed method achieves superior performance when all modalities are present as well as in the case of missing modalities during training or testing compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, applying FL to real-world data presents challenges, particularly as most existing FL research focuses on unimodal data. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) has emerged to address these challenges, leveraging modality-specific encoder models to process diverse datasets. Current MFL methods often uniformly allocate computational frequencies across all modalities, which is inefficient for IoT devices with limited resources. In this paper, we propose FlexMod, a novel approach to enhance computational efficiency in MFL by adaptively allocating training resources for each modality encoder based on their importance and training requirements. We employ prototype learning to assess the quality of modality encoders, use Shapley values to quantify the importance of each modality, and adopt the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method from deep reinforcement learning to optimize the allocation of training resources. Our method prioritizes critical modalities, optimizing model performance and resource utilization. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the performance of MFL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TMC, under review</p></details> | None |

However, it has been found that such vision-language models lack the ability to correctly reason over spatial relationships. To tackle this shortcoming, we develop the REVISION framework which improves spatial fidelity in vision-language models. REVISION is a 3D rendering based pipeline that generates spatially accurate synthetic images, given a textual prompt. REVISION is an extendable framework, which currently supports 100+ 3D assets, 11 spatial relationships, all with diverse camera perspectives and backgrounds. Leveraging images from REVISION as additional guidance in a training-free manner consistently improves the spatial consistency of T2I models across all spatial relationships, achieving competitive performance on the VISOR and T2I-CompBench benchmarks. We also design RevQA, a question-answering benchmark to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs, and find that state-of-the-art models are not robust to complex spatial reasoning under adversarial settings. Our results and findings indicate that utilizing rendering-based frameworks is an effective approach for developing spatially-aware generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

The efficient extraction and integration of audio and visual modal information have always been challenging in this field. In this paper, we introduce CACE-Net, which differs from most existing methods that solely use audio signals to guide visual information. We propose an audio-visual co-guidance attention mechanism that allows for adaptive bi-directional cross-modal attentional guidance between audio and visual information, thus reducing inconsistencies between modalities. Moreover, we have observed that existing methods have difficulty distinguishing between similar background and event and lack the fine-grained features for event classification. Consequently, we employ background-event contrast enhancement to increase the discrimination of fused feature and fine-tuned pre-trained model to extract more refined and discernible features from complex multimodal inputs. Specifically, we have enhanced the model's ability to discern subtle differences between event and background and improved the accuracy of event classification in our model. Experiments on the AVE dataset demonstrate that CACE-Net sets a new benchmark in the audio-visual event localization task, proving the effectiveness of our proposed methods in handling complex multimodal learning and event localization in unconstrained videos.

| **[Distribution-Level Memory Recall for Continual Learning: Preserving Knowledge and Avoiding Confusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02695v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn new data without forgetting previously learned knowledge. The key to achieving this goal is to avoid confusion at the feature level, i.e., avoiding confusion within old tasks and between new and old tasks. Previous prototype-based CL methods generate pseudo features for old knowledge replay by adding Gaussian noise to the centroids of old classes. However, the distribution in the feature space exhibits anisotropy during the incremental process, which prevents the pseudo features from faithfully reproducing the distribution of old knowledge in the feature space, leading to confusion in classification boundaries within old tasks. To address this issue, we propose the Distribution-Level Memory Recall (DMR) method, which uses a Gaussian mixture model to precisely fit the feature distribution of old knowledge at the distribution level and generate pseudo features in the next stage. Furthermore, resistance to confusion at the distribution level is also crucial for multimodal learning, as the problem of multimodal imbalance results in significant differences in feature responses between different modalities, exacerbating confusion within old tasks in prototype-based CL methods. Therefore, we mitigate the multi-modal imbalance problem by using the Inter-modal Guidance and Intra-modal Mining (IGIM) method to guide weaker modalities with prior information from dominant modalities and further explore useful information within modalities. For the second key, We propose the Confusion Index to quantitatively describe a model's ability to distinguish between new and old tasks, and we use the Incremental Mixup Feature Enhancement (IMFE) method to enhance pseudo features with new sample features, alleviating classification confusion between new and old knowledge.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MiPa: Mixed Patch Infrared-Visible Modality Agnostic Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18849v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, using multiple modalities like visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) can greatly improve the performance of a predictive task such as object detection (OD). Multimodal learning is a common way to leverage these modalities, where multiple modality-specific encoders and a fusion module are used to improve performance. In this paper, we tackle a different way to employ RGB and IR modalities, where only one modality or the other is observed by a single shared vision encoder. This realistic setting requires a lower memory footprint and is more suitable for applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance, which commonly rely on RGB and IR data. However, when learning a single encoder on multiple modalities, one modality can dominate the other, producing uneven recognition results. This work investigates how to efficiently leverage RGB and IR modalities to train a common transformer-based OD vision encoder, while countering the effects of modality imbalance. For this, we introduce a novel training technique to Mix Patches (MiPa) from the two modalities, in conjunction with a patch-wise modality agnostic module, for learning a common representation of both modalities. Our experiments show that MiPa can learn a representation to reach competitive results on traditional RGB/IR benchmarks while only requiring a single modality during inference.

Yet, current VLP approaches with the masked modelling strategy face two challenges when applied to the medical domain. First, current models struggle to accurately reconstruct key pathological features due to the scarcity of medical data. Second, most methods only adopt either paired image-text or image-only data, failing to exploit the combination of both paired and unpaired data. To this end, this paper proposes a XLIP (Masked modelling for medical Language-Image Pre-training) framework to enhance pathological learning and feature learning via unpaired data. First, we introduce the attention-masked image modelling (AttMIM) and entity-driven masked language modelling module (EntMLM), which learns to reconstruct pathological visual and textual tokens via multi-modal feature interaction, thus improving medical-enhanced features. The AttMIM module masks a portion of the image features that are highly responsive to textual features. This allows XLIP to improve the reconstruction of highly similar image data in medicine efficiency. Second, our XLIP capitalizes unpaired data to enhance multimodal learning by introducing disease-kind prompts. The experimental results show that XLIP achieves SOTA for zero-shot and fine-tuning classification performance on five datasets.

| **[HyperMM : Robust Multimodal Learning with Varying-sized Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20768v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining multiple modalities carrying complementary information through multimodal learning (MML) has shown considerable benefits for diagnosing multiple pathologies. However, the robustness of multimodal models to missing modalities is often overlooked. Most works assume modality completeness in the input data, while in clinical practice, it is common to have incomplete modalities. Existing solutions that address this issue rely on modality imputation strategies before using supervised learning models. These strategies, however, are complex, computationally costly and can strongly impact subsequent prediction models. Hence, they should be used with parsimony in sensitive applications such as healthcare. We propose HyperMM, an end-to-end framework designed for learning with varying-sized inputs. Specifically, we focus on the task of supervised MML with missing imaging modalities without using imputation before training. We introduce a novel strategy for training a universal feature extractor using a conditional hypernetwork, and propose a permutation-invariant neural network that can handle inputs of varying dimensions to process the extracted features, in a two-phase task-agnostic framework. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our method in two tasks: Alzheimer's disease detection and breast cancer classification. We demonstrate that our strategy is robust to high rates of missing data and that its flexibility allows it to handle varying-sized datasets beyond the scenario of missing modalities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Detached and Interactive Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19514v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Learning (MML) has gained significant interest as it compensates for single-modality limitations through comprehensive complementary information within multimodal data. However, traditional MML methods generally use the joint learning framework with a uniform learning objective that can lead to the modality competition issue, where feedback predominantly comes from certain modalities, limiting the full potential of others. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces DI-MML, a novel detached MML framework designed to learn complementary information across modalities under the premise of avoiding modality competition. Specifically, DI-MML addresses competition by separately training each modality encoder with isolated learning objectives. It further encourages cross-modal interaction via a shared classifier that defines a common feature space and employing a dimension-decoupled unidirectional contrastive (DUC) loss to facilitate modality-level knowledge transfer. Additionally, to account for varying reliability in sample pairs, we devise a certainty-aware logit weighting strategy to effectively leverage complementary information at the instance level during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on audio-visual, flow-image, and front-rear view datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method.

| **[Unifying Visual and Semantic Feature Spaces with Diffusion Models for Enhanced Cross-Modal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18854v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image classification models often demonstrate unstable performance in real-world applications due to variations in image information, driven by differing visual perspectives of subject objects and lighting discrepancies. To mitigate these challenges, existing studies commonly incorporate additional modal information matching the visual data to regularize the model's learning process, enabling the extraction of high-quality visual features from complex image regions. Specifically, in the realm of multimodal learning, cross-modal alignment is recognized as an effective strategy, harmonizing different modal information by learning a domain-consistent latent feature space for visual and semantic features. However, this approach may face limitations due to the heterogeneity between multimodal information, such as differences in feature distribution and structure. To address this issue, we introduce a Multimodal Alignment and Reconstruction Network (MARNet), designed to enhance the model's resistance to visual noise. Importantly, MARNet includes a cross-modal diffusion reconstruction module for smoothly and stably blending information across different domains. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, Vireo-Food172 and Ingredient-101, demonstrate that MARNet effectively improves the quality of image information extracted by the model. It is a plug-and-play framework that can be rapidly integrated into various image classification frameworks, boosting model performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Methods: This study investigates Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models trained on radiomic features extracted from T2-weighted MRI images using Pyradiomics and MRCradiomics libraries. Feature selection was performed using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) technique. We aimed to enhance clinical decision support through multimodal learning and feature fusion. Results: Our SVM model, utilizing combined features from Pyradiomics and MRCradiomics, achieved an AUC of 0.74 on the Multi-Improd dataset (Siemens scanner) but decreased to 0.60 on the Philips test set. The RF model showed similar trends, with notable robustness for models using Pyradiomics features alone (AUC of 0.78 on Philips). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal feature integration to improve the robustness and generalizability of machine-learning models for clinical decision support in prostate cancer detection. This study marks a significant step towards developing reliable AI-driven diagnostic tools that maintain efficacy across various imaging platforms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Chameleon: Images Are What You Need For Multimodal Learning Robust To Missing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16243v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has demonstrated remarkable performance improvements over unimodal architectures. However, multimodal learning methods often exhibit deteriorated performances if one or more modalities are missing. This may be attributed to the commonly used multi-branch design containing modality-specific streams making the models reliant on the availability of a complete set of modalities. In this work, we propose a robust textual-visual multimodal learning method, Chameleon, that completely deviates from the conventional multi-branch design. To enable this, we present the unification of input modalities into one format by encoding textual modality into visual representations. As a result, our approach does not require modality-specific branches to learn modality-independent multimodal representations making it robust to missing modalities. Extensive experiments are performed on four popular challenging datasets including Hateful Memes, UPMC Food-101, MM-IMDb, and Ferramenta. Chameleon not only achieves superior performance when all modalities are present at train/test time but also demonstrates notable resilience in the case of missing modalities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Multimodal Learning from Data-centric Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11530v3)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities in general visual understanding and reasoning tasks. However, their deployment is hindered by substantial computational costs in both training and inference, limiting accessibility to the broader research and user communities. A straightforward solution is to leverage smaller pre-trained vision and language models, which inevitably cause significant performance drops. In this paper, we demonstrate the possibility of training a smaller but better MLLM with high-quality training data. Specifically, we introduce Bunny, a family of lightweight MLLMs with flexible vision and language backbones for efficient multimodal learning from selected training data. Experiments show that our Bunny-4B/8B outperforms the state-of-the-art large MLLMs on multiple benchmarks. We expect that this work can provide the community with a clean and flexible open-source tool for further research and development.

However, researchers face challenges due to the costly and time-consuming collection process of existing audio-language datasets, which are limited in size. To address this data scarcity issue, we introduce WavCaps, the first large-scale weakly-labelled audio captioning dataset, comprising approximately 400k audio clips with paired captions. We sourced audio clips and their raw descriptions from web sources and a sound event detection dataset. However, the online-harvested raw descriptions are highly noisy and unsuitable for direct use in tasks such as automated audio captioning. To overcome this issue, we propose a three-stage processing pipeline for filtering noisy data and generating high-quality captions, where ChatGPT, a large language model, is leveraged to filter and transform raw descriptions automatically. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of WavCaps dataset and evaluate it on multiple downstream audio-language multimodal learning tasks. The systems trained on WavCaps outperform previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by a significant margin. Our aspiration is for the WavCaps dataset we have proposed to facilitate research in audio-language multimodal learning and demonstrate the potential of utilizing ChatGPT to enhance academic research.

| **[A Recent Survey of Heterogeneous Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08459v3)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of transfer learning, leveraging knowledge from source domains to enhance model performance in a target domain, has significantly grown, supporting diverse real-world applications. Its success often relies on shared knowledge between domains, typically required in these methodologies. Commonly, methods assume identical feature and label spaces in both domains, known as homogeneous transfer learning. However, this is often impractical as source and target domains usually differ in these spaces, making precise data matching challenging and costly. Consequently, heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL), which addresses these disparities, has become a vital strategy in various tasks. In this paper, we offer an extensive review of over 60 HTL methods, covering both data-based and model-based approaches. We describe the key assumptions and algorithms of these methods and systematically categorize them into instance-based, feature representation-based, parameter regularization, and parameter tuning techniques. Additionally, we explore applications in natural language processing, computer vision, multimodal learning, and biomedicine, aiming to deepen understanding and stimulate further research in these areas. Our paper includes recent advancements in HTL, such as the introduction of transformer-based models and multimodal learning techniques, ensuring the review captures the latest developments in the field. We identify key limitations in current HTL studies and offer systematic guidance for future research, highlighting areas needing further exploration and suggesting potential directions for advancing the field.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[On Stronger Computational Separations Between Multimodal and Unimodal Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02254v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multimodal machine learning has enjoyed huge empirical success (e.g. GPT-4). Motivated to develop theoretical justification for this empirical success, Lu (NeurIPS '23, ALT '24) introduces a theory of multimodal learning, and considers possible \textit{separations} between theoretical models of multimodal and unimodal learning. In particular, Lu (ALT '24) shows a computational separation, which is relevant to \textit{worst-case} instances of the learning task. In this paper, we give a stronger \textit{average-case} computational separation, where for ``typical'' instances of the learning task, unimodal learning is computationally hard, but multimodal learning is easy. We then question how ``natural'' the average-case separation is. Would it be encountered in practice? To this end, we prove that under basic conditions, any given computational separation between average-case unimodal and multimodal learning tasks implies a corresponding cryptographic key agreement protocol. We suggest to interpret this as evidence that very strong \textit{computational} advantages of multimodal learning may arise \textit{infrequently} in practice, since they exist only for the ``pathological'' case of inherently cryptographic distributions. However, this does not apply to possible (super-polynomial) \textit{statistical} advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in ICML 2024.

| **[Missing Modality Prediction for Unpaired Multimodal Learning via Joint Embedding of Unimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12616v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning typically relies on the assumption that all modalities are fully available during both the training and inference phases. However, in real-world scenarios, consistently acquiring complete multimodal data presents significant challenges due to various factors. This often leads to the issue of missing modalities, where data for certain modalities are absent, posing considerable obstacles not only for the availability of multimodal pretrained models but also for their fine-tuning and the preservation of robustness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework integrating parameter-efficient fine-tuning of unimodal pretrained models with a self-supervised joint-embedding learning method. This framework enables the model to predict the embedding of a missing modality in the representation space during inference. Our method effectively predicts the missing embedding through prompt tuning, leveraging information from available modalities. We evaluate our approach on several multimodal benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness across various scenarios of missing modalities.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | None |

However, current multimodal EO datasets and models typically focus on a single data type, either mono-date images or time series, which limits their impact. To address this issue, we introduce OmniSat, a novel architecture able to merge diverse EO modalities into expressive features without labels by exploiting their alignment. To demonstrate the advantages of our approach, we create two new multimodal datasets by augmenting existing ones with new modalities. As demonstrated for three downstream tasks -- forestry, land cover classification, and crop mapping -- OmniSat can learn rich representations without supervision, leading to state-of-the-art performances in semi- and fully supervised settings. Furthermore, our multimodal pretraining scheme improves performance even when only one modality is available for inference.

| **[A Survey on Safe Multi-Modal Learning System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05355v6)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, multimodal learning systems (MMLS) have gained traction for their ability to process and integrate information from diverse modality inputs. Their expanding use in vital sectors such as healthcare has made safety assurance a critical concern. However, the absence of systematic research into their safety is a significant barrier to progress in this field. To bridge the gap, we present the first taxonomy that systematically categorizes and assesses MMLS safety. This taxonomy is structured around four fundamental pillars that are critical to ensuring the safety of MMLS: robustness, alignment, monitoring, and controllability. Leveraging this taxonomy, we review existing methodologies, benchmarks, and the current state of research, while also pinpointing the principal limitations and gaps in knowledge. Finally, we discuss unique challenges in MMLS safety. In illuminating these challenges, we aim to pave the way for future research, proposing potential directions that could lead to significant advancements in the safety protocols of MMLS.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Diagnosing and Re-learning for Balanced Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09705v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To overcome the imbalanced multimodal learning problem, where models prefer the training of specific modalities, existing methods propose to control the training of uni-modal encoders from different perspectives, taking the inter-modal performance discrepancy as the basis. However, the intrinsic limitation of modality capacity is ignored. The scarcely informative modalities can be recognized as ``worse-learnt'' ones, which could force the model to memorize more noise, counterproductively affecting the multimodal model ability. Moreover, the current modality modulation methods narrowly concentrate on selected worse-learnt modalities, even suppressing the training of others. Hence, it is essential to consider the intrinsic limitation of modality capacity and take all modalities into account during balancing. To this end, we propose the Diagnosing \& Re-learning method. The learning state of each modality is firstly estimated based on the separability of its uni-modal representation space, and then used to softly re-initialize the corresponding uni-modal encoder. In this way, the over-emphasizing of scarcely informative modalities is avoided. In addition, encoders of worse-learnt modalities are enhanced, simultaneously avoiding the over-training of other modalities. Accordingly, multimodal learning is effectively balanced and enhanced. Experiments covering multiple types of modalities and multimodal frameworks demonstrate the superior performance of our simple-yet-effective method for balanced multimodal learning.

| **[Complementary Information Mutual Learning for Multimodality Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02717v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiologists must utilize multiple modal images for tumor segmentation and diagnosis due to the limitations of medical imaging and the diversity of tumor signals. This leads to the development of multimodal learning in segmentation. However, the redundancy among modalities creates challenges for existing subtraction-based joint learning methods, such as misjudging the importance of modalities, ignoring specific modal information, and increasing cognitive load. These thorny issues ultimately decrease segmentation accuracy and increase the risk of overfitting. This paper presents the complementary information mutual learning (CIML) framework, which can mathematically model and address the negative impact of inter-modal redundant information. CIML adopts the idea of addition and removes inter-modal redundant information through inductive bias-driven task decomposition and message passing-based redundancy filtering. CIML first decomposes the multimodal segmentation task into multiple subtasks based on expert prior knowledge, minimizing the information dependence between modalities. Furthermore, CIML introduces a scheme in which each modality can extract information from other modalities additively through message passing. To achieve non-redundancy of extracted information, the redundant filtering is transformed into complementary information learning inspired by the variational information bottleneck. The complementary information learning procedure can be efficiently solved by variational inference and cross-modal spatial attention. Numerical results from the verification task and standard benchmarks indicate that CIML efficiently removes redundant information between modalities, outperforming SOTA methods regarding validation accuracy and segmentation effect.</p></details> | 35 pages, 18 figures | None |
| **[Multimodal Classification via Modal-Aware Interactive Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04587v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the notorious modality imbalance problem, multimodal learning (MML) leads to the phenomenon of optimization imbalance, thus struggling to achieve satisfactory performance. Recently, some representative methods have been proposed to boost the performance, mainly focusing on adaptive adjusting the optimization of each modality to rebalance the learning speed of dominant and non-dominant modalities. To better facilitate the interaction of model information in multimodal learning, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal learning method, called modal-aware interactive enhancement (MIE). Specifically, we first utilize an optimization strategy based on sharpness aware minimization (SAM) to smooth the learning objective during the forward phase. Then, with the help of the geometry property of SAM, we propose a gradient modification strategy to impose the influence between different modalities during the backward phase. Therefore, we can improve the generalization ability and alleviate the modality forgetting phenomenon simultaneously for multimodal learning. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform various state-of-the-art baselines to achieve the best performance.</p></details> |  | None |
