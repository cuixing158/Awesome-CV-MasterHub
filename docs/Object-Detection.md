| **[MonoCoP: Chain-of-Prediction for Monocular 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04594v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting 3D attributes is crucial for monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D), with depth estimation posing the greatest challenge due to the inherent ambiguity in mapping 2D images to 3D space. While existing methods leverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling depth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth prediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes are intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which ultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which leverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and conditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweight AttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features. Next, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features from one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to aggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later attribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes without forgetting the features of earlier ones. Experimental results show that our MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTI leaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existing methods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DeCLIP: Decoupled Learning for Open-Vocabulary Dense Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04410v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense visual prediction tasks have been constrained by their reliance on predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense prediction often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. The ``content'' features are aligned with image crop representations to improve local discriminability, while ``context'' features learn to retain the spatial correlations under the guidance of vision foundation models, such as DINO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation.

| **[DA-Mamba: Domain Adaptive Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Based One-Stage Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11178v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent 2D CNN-based domain adaptation approaches struggle with long-range dependencies due to limited receptive fields, making it difficult to adapt to target domains with significant spatial distribution changes. While transformer-based domain adaptation methods better capture distant relationships through self-attention mechanisms that facilitate more effective cross-domain feature alignment, their quadratic computational complexity makes practical deployment challenging for object detection tasks across diverse domains. Inspired by the global modeling and linear computation complexity of the Mamba architecture, we present the first domain-adaptive Mamba-based one-stage object detection model, termed DA-Mamba. Specifically, we combine Mamba's efficient state-space modeling with attention mechanisms to address domain-specific spatial and channel-wise variations. Our design leverages domain-adaptive spatial and channel-wise scanning within the Mamba block to extract highly transferable representations for efficient sequential processing, while cross-attention modules generate long-range, mixed-domain spatial features to enable robust soft alignment across domains. Besides, motivated by the observation that hybrid architectures introduce feature noise in domain adaptation tasks, we propose an entropy-based knowledge distillation framework with margin ReLU, which adaptively refines multi-level representations by suppressing irrelevant activations and aligning uncertainty across source and target domains. Finally, to prevent overfitting caused by the mixed-up features generated through cross-attention mechanisms, we propose entropy-driven gating attention with random perturbations that simultaneously refine target features and enhance model generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LogisticsVLN: Vision-Language Navigation For Low-Altitude Terminal Delivery Based on Agentic UAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03460v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent logistics, particularly fine-grained terminal delivery, underscores the need for autonomous UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)-based delivery systems. However, most existing last-mile delivery studies rely on ground robots, while current UAV-based Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks primarily focus on coarse-grained, long-range goals, making them unsuitable for precise terminal delivery. To bridge this gap, we propose LogisticsVLN, a scalable aerial delivery system built on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for autonomous terminal delivery. LogisticsVLN integrates lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual-Language Models (VLMs) in a modular pipeline for request understanding, floor localization, object detection, and action-decision making. To support research and evaluation in this new setting, we construct the Vision-Language Delivery (VLD) dataset within the CARLA simulator. Experimental results on the VLD dataset showcase the feasibility of the LogisticsVLN system. In addition, we conduct subtask-level evaluations of each module of our system, offering valuable insights for improving the robustness and real-world deployment of foundation model-based vision-language delivery systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Word to Sentence: A Large-Scale Multi-Instance Dataset for Open-Set Aerial Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03334v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, language-guided open-world aerial object detection has gained significant attention due to its better alignment with real-world application needs. However, due to limited datasets, most existing language-guided methods primarily focus on vocabulary, which fails to meet the demands of more fine-grained open-world detection. To address this limitation, we propose constructing a large-scale language-guided open-set aerial detection dataset, encompassing three levels of language guidance: from words to phrases, and ultimately to sentences. Centered around an open-source large vision-language model and integrating image-operation-based preprocessing with BERT-based postprocessing, we present the OS-W2S Label Engine, an automatic annotation pipeline capable of handling diverse scene annotations for aerial images. Using this label engine, we expand existing aerial detection datasets with rich textual annotations and construct a novel benchmark dataset, called Multi-instance Open-set Aerial Dataset (MI-OAD), addressing the limitations of current remote sensing grounding data and enabling effective open-set aerial detection. Specifically, MI-OAD contains 163,023 images and 2 million image-caption pairs, approximately 40 times larger than comparable datasets. We also employ state-of-the-art open-set methods from the natural image domain, trained on our proposed dataset, to validate the model's open-set detection capabilities. For instance, when trained on our dataset, Grounding DINO achieves improvements of 29.5 AP_{50} and 33.7 Recall@10 for sentence inputs under zero-shot transfer conditions. Both the dataset and the label engine will be released publicly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Aligning Data Selection with Performance: Performance-driven Reinforcement Learning for Active Learning in Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08387v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeled data by selecting the most informative instances for labeling. However, existing methods for assessing data informativeness often fail to align directly with task model performance metrics, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. This paper introduces Mean-AP Guided Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness for deep detection networks, directly optimizing the sampling strategy using mAP. MGRAL employs a reinforcement learning agent based on LSTM architecture to efficiently navigate the combinatorial challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable nature between performance and selected batches. The agent optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as the reward signal. To address the computational intensity of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, we implement fast look-up tables, ensuring real-world feasibility. We evaluate MGRAL on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks across various backbone architectures. Our approach demonstrates strong performance, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-based active learning for object detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Instance Segmentation of Scene Sketches Using Natural Image Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09608v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketch segmentation involves grouping pixels within a sketch that belong to the same object or instance. It serves as a valuable tool for sketch editing tasks, such as moving, scaling, or removing specific components. While image segmentation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recent years, sketches present unique challenges for these models due to their sparse nature and wide variation in styles. We introduce InkLayer, a method for instance segmentation of raster scene sketches. Our approach adapts state-of-the-art image segmentation and object detection models to the sketch domain by employing class-agnostic fine-tuning and refining segmentation masks using depth cues. Furthermore, our method organizes sketches into sorted layers, where occluded instances are inpainted, enabling advanced sketch editing applications. As existing datasets in this domain lack variation in sketch styles, we construct a synthetic scene sketch segmentation dataset, InkScenes, featuring sketches with diverse brush strokes and varying levels of detail. We use this dataset to demonstrate the robustness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://inklayer.github.io</p></details> | None |
| **[VISLIX: An XAI Framework for Validating Vision Models with Slice Discovery and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03132v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world machine learning models require rigorous evaluation before deployment, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and surveillance. The evaluation of machine learning models often focuses on data slices, which are subsets of the data that share a set of characteristics. Data slice finding automatically identifies conditions or data subgroups where models underperform, aiding developers in mitigating performance issues. Despite its popularity and effectiveness, data slicing for vision model validation faces several challenges. First, data slicing often needs additional image metadata or visual concepts, and falls short in certain computer vision tasks, such as object detection. Second, understanding data slices is a labor-intensive and mentally demanding process that heavily relies on the expert's domain knowledge. Third, data slicing lacks a human-in-the-loop solution that allows experts to form hypothesis and test them interactively. To overcome these limitations and better support the machine learning operations lifecycle, we introduce VISLIX, a novel visual analytics framework that employs state-of-the-art foundation models to help domain experts analyze slices in computer vision models. Our approach does not require image metadata or visual concepts, automatically generates natural language insights, and allows users to test data slice hypothesis interactively. We evaluate VISLIX with an expert study and three use cases, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool in providing comprehensive insights for validating object detection models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sim2Real Transfer for Vision-Based Grasp Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03046v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The verification of successful grasps is a crucial aspect of robot manipulation, particularly when handling deformable objects. Traditional methods relying on force and tactile sensors often struggle with deformable and non-rigid objects. In this work, we present a vision-based approach for grasp verification to determine whether the robotic gripper has successfully grasped an object. Our method employs a two-stage architecture; first YOLO-based object detection model to detect and locate the robot's gripper and then a ResNet-based classifier determines the presence of an object. To address the limitations of real-world data capture, we introduce HSR-GraspSynth, a synthetic dataset designed to simulate diverse grasping scenarios. Furthermore, we explore the use of Visual Question Answering capabilities as a zero-shot baseline to which we compare our model. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy in real-world environments, with potential for integration into grasping pipelines.

| **[DPNet: Dynamic Pooling Network for Tiny Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02797v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In unmanned aerial systems, especially in complex environments, accurately detecting tiny objects is crucial. Resizing images is a common strategy to improve detection accuracy, particularly for small objects. However, simply enlarging images significantly increases computational costs and the number of negative samples, severely degrading detection performance and limiting its applicability. This paper proposes a Dynamic Pooling Network (DPNet) for tiny object detection to mitigate these issues. DPNet employs a flexible down-sampling strategy by introducing a factor (df) to relax the fixed downsampling process of the feature map to an adjustable one. Furthermore, we design a lightweight predictor to predict df for each input image, which is used to decrease the resolution of feature maps in the backbone. Thus, we achieve input-aware downsampling. We also design an Adaptive Normalization Module (ANM) to make a unified detector compatible with different dfs. A guidance loss supervises the predictor's training. DPNet dynamically allocates computing resources to trade off between detection accuracy and efficiency. Experiments on the TinyCOCO and TinyPerson datasets show that DPNet can save over 35% and 25% GFLOPs, respectively, while maintaining comparable detection performance. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures Haotian Chen and Luqi Gong contributed equally to this work</p></details> | None |
| **[RGBX-DiffusionDet: A Framework for Multi-Modal RGB-X Object Detection Using DiffusionDet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02586v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces RGBX-DiffusionDet, an object detection framework extending the DiffusionDet model to fuse the heterogeneous 2D data (X) with RGB imagery via an adaptive multimodal encoder. To enable cross-modal interaction, we design the dynamic channel reduction within a convolutional block attention module (DCR-CBAM), which facilitates cross-talk between subnetworks by dynamically highlighting salient channel features. Furthermore, the dynamic multi-level aggregation block (DMLAB) is proposed to refine spatial feature representations through adaptive multiscale fusion. Finally, novel regularization losses that enforce channel saliency and spatial selectivity are introduced, leading to compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments using RGB-Depth (KITTI), a novel annotated RGB-Polarimetric dataset, and RGB-Infrared (M$^3$FD) benchmark dataset were conducted. We demonstrate consistent superiority of the proposed approach over the baseline RGB-only DiffusionDet. The modular architecture maintains the original decoding complexity, ensuring efficiency. These results establish the proposed RGBX-DiffusionDet as a flexible multimodal object detection approach, providing new insights into integrating diverse 2D sensing modalities into diffusion-based detection pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Point Cloud Recombination: Systematic Real Data Augmentation Using Robotic Targets for LiDAR Perception Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02476v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The validation of LiDAR-based perception of intelligent mobile systems operating in open-world applications remains a challenge due to the variability of real environmental conditions. Virtual simulations allow the generation of arbitrary scenes under controlled conditions but lack physical sensor characteristics, such as intensity responses or material-dependent effects. In contrast, real-world data offers true sensor realism but provides less control over influencing factors, hindering sufficient validation. Existing approaches address this problem with augmentation of real-world point cloud data by transferring objects between scenes. However, these methods do not consider validation and remain limited in controllability because they rely on empirical data. We solve these limitations by proposing Point Cloud Recombination, which systematically augments captured point cloud scenes by integrating point clouds acquired from physical target objects measured in controlled laboratory environments. Thus enabling the creation of vast amounts and varieties of repeatable, physically accurate test scenes with respect to phenomena-aware occlusions with registered 3D meshes. Using the Ouster OS1-128 Rev7 sensor, we demonstrate the augmentation of real-world urban and rural scenes with humanoid targets featuring varied clothing and poses, for repeatable positioning. We show that the recombined scenes closely match real sensor outputs, enabling targeted testing, scalable failure analysis, and improved system safety. By providing controlled yet sensor-realistic data, our method enables trustworthy conclusions about the limitations of specific sensors in compound with their algorithms, e.g., object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print for IEEE IAVVC 2025</p></details> | None |

We introduce DriveNetBench, an affordable and configurable benchmarking system designed to evaluate autonomous driving networks using a single-camera setup. Leveraging low-cost, off-the-shelf hardware, and a flexible software stack, DriveNetBench enables easy integration of various driving models, such as object detection and lane following, while ensuring standardized evaluation in real-world scenarios. Our system replicates common driving conditions and provides consistent, repeatable metrics for comparing network performance. Through preliminary experiments with representative vision models, we illustrate how DriveNetBench effectively measures inference speed and accuracy within a controlled test environment. The key contributions of this work include its affordability, its replicability through open-source software, and its seamless integration into existing workflows, making autonomous vehicle research more accessible.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01892v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With $700$ stars on GitHub and part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer consists of the standard method to apply graph-based optimizations on ONNX models. However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15 issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies. In addition, $30$% of the classification models presented accuracy differences across the original and the optimized model variants, while $16.6$% of semantic segmentation and object detection models are also affected, at least to a limited extent.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[CMAWRNet: Multiple Adverse Weather Removal via a Unified Quaternion Neural Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01882v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images used in real-world applications such as image or video retrieval, outdoor surveillance, and autonomous driving suffer from poor weather conditions. When designing robust computer vision systems, removing adverse weather such as haze, rain, and snow is a significant problem. Recently, deep-learning methods offered a solution for a single type of degradation. Current state-of-the-art universal methods struggle with combinations of degradations, such as haze and rain-streak. Few algorithms have been developed that perform well when presented with images containing multiple adverse weather conditions. This work focuses on developing an efficient solution for multiple adverse weather removal using a unified quaternion neural architecture called CMAWRNet. It is based on a novel texture-structure decomposition block, a novel lightweight encoder-decoder quaternion transformer architecture, and an attentive fusion block with low-light correction. We also introduce a quaternion similarity loss function to preserve color information better. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the current state-of-the-art benchmarking datasets and real-world images shows the performance advantages of the proposed CMAWRNet compared to other state-of-the-art weather removal approaches dealing with multiple weather artifacts. Extensive computer simulations validate that CMAWRNet improves the performance of downstream applications such as object detection. This is the first time the decomposition approach has been applied to the universal weather removal task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DualDiff: Dual-branch Diffusion Model for Autonomous Driving with Semantic Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01857v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and high-fidelity driving scene reconstruction relies on fully leveraging scene information as conditioning. However, existing approaches, which primarily use 3D bounding boxes and binary maps for foreground and background control, fall short in capturing the complexity of the scene and integrating multi-modal information. In this paper, we propose DualDiff, a dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance multi-view driving scene generation. We introduce Occupancy Ray Sampling (ORS), a semantic-rich 3D representation, alongside numerical driving scene representation, for comprehensive foreground and background control. To improve cross-modal information integration, we propose a Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism that aligns and fuses features across modalities. Furthermore, we design a foreground-aware masked (FGM) loss to enhance the generation of tiny objects. DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in FID score, as well as consistently better results in downstream BEV segmentation and 3D object detection tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures, | None |

A solution to the challenge is effective space object detection (SOD) for collision assessment and avoidance. In SOD, an LEO satellite must detect other satellites and objects with high precision and minimal delay. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing vision sensors for SOD tasks based on deep learning (DL) models. It introduces models based on the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layer, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) and evaluates their performance under SOD scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed models achieve mean average precision at intersection over union threshold 0.5 (mAP50) scores of up to 0.751 and mean average precision averaged over intersection over union thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP50:95) scores of up to 0.280. Compared to the baseline GELAN-t model, the proposed GELAN-ViT-SE model increases the average mAP50 from 0.721 to 0.751, improves the mAP50:95 from 0.266 to 0.274, reduces giga floating point operations (GFLOPs) from 7.3 to 5.6, and lowers peak power consumption from 2080.7 mW to 2028.7 mW by 2.5\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the 18th International Conference on Space Operations (SpaceOps 2025)</p></details> | None |

Feature confusion, including object-background confusion and object-object confusion, presents significant challenges in both cross-domain and few-shot settings. In this work, we introduce CDFormer, a cross-domain few-shot object detection transformer against feature confusion, to address these challenges. The method specifically tackles feature confusion through two key modules: object-background distinguishing (OBD) and object-object distinguishing (OOD). The OBD module leverages a learnable background token to differentiate between objects and background, while the OOD module enhances the distinction between objects of different classes. Experimental results demonstrate that CDFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 12.9% mAP, 11.0% mAP, and 10.4% mAP improvements under the 1/5/10 shot settings, respectively, when fine-tuned.</p></details> |  | None |

To practically deploy such technologies, it is essential to achieve real-time processing within low-power embedded environments. Addressing this, we present the first on-chip implementation of a 4D radar-based 3D object detection model on the Hailo-8L AI accelerator. Although conventional 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures require 5D inputs, the Hailo-8L only supports 4D tensors, posing a significant challenge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a tensor transformation method that reshapes 5D inputs into 4D formats during the compilation process, enabling direct deployment without altering the model structure. The proposed system achieves 46.47% AP_3D and 52.75% AP_BEV, maintaining comparable accuracy to GPU-based models while achieving an inference speed of 13.76 Hz. These results demonstrate the applicability of 4D radar-based perception technologies to autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 4pages, 2 figures | None |

In computer vision, the attention mechanism was first incorporated in the Vision Transformer ViT, and then its usage has expanded into many tasks in the vision domain, such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and image generation. While the attention mechanism is very expressive and capable, it comes with the disadvantage of being computationally expensive and requiring datasets of considerable size for effective optimization. To address these shortcomings, many designs have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational burden and alleviate the data size requirements. Examples of such attempts in the vision domain are the MLP-Mixer, the Conv-Mixer, the Perciver-IO, and many more attempts with different sets of advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a new computational block as an alternative to the standard ViT block. The newly proposed block reduces the computational requirements by replacing the normal attention layers with a Network in Network structure, therefore enhancing the static approach of the MLP-Mixer with a dynamic learning of element-wise gating function generated by a token mixing process. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed design provides better performance than the baseline architectures on multiple datasets applied in the image classification task of the vision domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Comput & Applic (2025)</p></details> | None |

State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the recently proposed Mamba architecture, have emerged as a paradigm-shifting solution, combining linear computational scaling with global context modeling. This survey presents a comprehensive review of Mamba-based methodologies in remote sensing, systematically analyzing about 120 studies to construct a holistic taxonomy of innovations and applications. Our contributions are structured across five dimensions: (i) foundational principles of vision Mamba architectures, (ii) micro-architectural advancements such as adaptive scan strategies and hybrid SSM formulations, (iii) macro-architectural integrations, including CNN-Transformer-Mamba hybrids and frequency-domain adaptations, (iv) rigorous benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods in multiple application tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, change detection, etc. and (v) critical analysis of unresolved challenges with actionable future directions. By bridging the gap between SSM theory and remote sensing practice, this survey establishes Mamba as a transformative framework for remote sensing analysis. To our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review of Mamba architectures in remote sensing.

This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness.

Objects that are heavily occluded or intentionally concealed pose a great challenge for detection, whether by human observation or through advanced technological applications. While certain Deep Learning (DL) architectures demonstrate strong performance in processing local information, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others excel in handling distant information, e.g., transformers. In X-ray security imaging the literature has been dominated by the use of CNN-based methods, while the integration of the two aforementioned leading architectures has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, various hybrid CNN-transformer architectures are evaluated against a common CNN object detection baseline, namely YOLOv8. In particular, a CNN (HGNetV2) and a hybrid CNN-transformer (Next-ViT-S) backbone are combined with different CNN/transformer detection heads (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR). The resulting architectures are comparatively evaluated on three challenging public X-ray inspection datasets, namely EDS, HiXray, and PIDray. Interestingly, while the YOLOv8 detector with its default backbone (CSP-DarkNet53) is generally shown to be advantageous on the HiXray and PIDray datasets, when a domain distribution shift is incorporated in the X-ray images (as happens in the EDS datasets), hybrid CNN-transformer architectures exhibit increased robustness. Detailed comparative evaluation results, including object-level detection performance and object-size error analysis, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each architectural combination and suggest guidelines for future research.

However, manual object tracking and matching across multiple non-overlapping cameras pose significant challenges in city-scale urban traffic scenarios. These challenges include handling diverse vehicle attributes, occlusions, illumination variations, shadows, and varying video resolutions. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object Multi-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT). The proposed framework utilizes Mask R-CNN for object detection and employs Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select target objects from overlapping detections. Transfer learning is employed for re-identification, enabling the association and generation of vehicle tracklets across multiple cameras. Moreover, we leverage appropriate loss functions and distance measures to handle occlusion, illumination, and shadow challenges. The final solution identification module performs feature extraction using ResNet-152 coupled with Deep SORT based vehicle tracking. The proposed framework is evaluated on the 5th AI City Challenge dataset (Track 3), comprising 46 camera feeds. Among these 46 camera streams, 40 are used for model training and validation, while the remaining six are utilized for model testing. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance with an IDF1 score of 0.8289, and precision and recall scores of 0.9026 and 0.8527 respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in robust and accurate vehicle tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current models require increasingly large datasets for training. Acquiring and labeling such data is costly, necessitating the development of new strategies to optimize this process. Active learning is a promising approach that has been extensively researched in the image domain. In our work, we extend this concept to the LiDAR domain by developing several inconsistency-based sample selection strategies and evaluate their effectiveness in various settings. Our results show that using a naive inconsistency approach based on the number of detected boxes, we achieve the same mAP as the random sampling strategy with 50% of the labeled data.</p></details> | Accepted in IV2025 | None |

Particularly, previous works on active learning for 3D object detection have shown that selection of samples in uncontrolled scenarios is challenging. Furthermore, current approaches focus exclusively on the theoretical aspects of the sample selection problem but neglect the practical insights that can be obtained from the extensive literature and application of 3D detection models. In this paper, we introduce HeAL (Heuristical-enhanced Active Learning for 3D Object Detection) which integrates those heuristical features together with Localization and Classification to deliver the most contributing samples to the model's training. In contrast to previous works, our approach integrates heuristical features such as object distance and point-quantity to estimate the uncertainty, which enhance the usefulness of selected samples to train detection models. Our quantitative evaluation on KITTI shows that HeAL presents competitive mAP with respect to the State-of-the-Art, and achieves the same mAP as the full-supervised baseline with only 24% of the samples.</p></details> | Accepted in CVPR2025 | None |

The ability to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work, we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion. Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics.

However, in the context of autonomous driving, their limited comprehension of 3D environments restricts their effectiveness in achieving a complete and safe understanding of dynamic surroundings. To address this, we introduce V3LMA, a novel approach that enhances 3D scene understanding by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with LVLMs. V3LMA leverages textual descriptions generated from object detections and video inputs, significantly boosting performance without requiring fine-tuning. Through a dedicated preprocessing pipeline that extracts 3D object data, our method improves situational awareness and decision-making in complex traffic scenarios, achieving a score of 0.56 on the LingoQA benchmark. We further explore different fusion strategies and token combinations with the goal of advancing the interpretation of traffic scenes, ultimately enabling safer autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that enables small object representations to "borrow" discriminative features from larger, semantically richer instances within the same class. Our architecture introduces three key components: the Feature Matching Block (FMB) to identify semantically similar descriptors across layers, the Feature Representing Block (FRB) to generate enhanced shallow features through weighted aggregation, and the Feature Fusion Block (FFB) to refine feature maps by integrating original, borrowed, and context information. Built upon the SSD framework, our method improves the descriptive capacity of shallow layers while maintaining real-time detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts small object detection accuracy over baseline methods, offering a promising direction for robust object detection in complex visual environments.</p></details> |  | None |

It involves specifying the target object, detecting it, and then gathering detailed information according to the user's intent. However, existing description- and detection-based assistive technologies do not sufficiently support the multifaceted nature of interactive object search tasks. We present ObjectFinder, an open-vocabulary wearable assistive system for interactive object search by blind people. ObjectFinder allows users to query target objects using flexible wording. Once the target object is detected, it provides egocentric localization information in real-time, including distance and direction. Users can then initiate different branches to gather detailed information based on their intent towards the target object, such as navigating to it or perceiving its surroundings. ObjectFinder is powered by a seamless combination of open-vocabulary models, namely an open-vocabulary object detector and a multimodal large language model. The ObjectFinder design concept and its development were carried out in collaboration with a blind co-designer. To evaluate ObjectFinder, we conducted an exploratory user study with eight blind participants. We compared ObjectFinder to BeMyAI and Google Lookout, popular description- and detection-based assistive applications. Our findings indicate that most participants felt more independent with ObjectFinder and preferred it for object search, as it enhanced scene context gathering and navigation, and allowed for active target identification. Finally, we discuss the implications for future assistive systems to support interactive object search.</p></details> |  | None |

The system integrates memory-augmented task planning, enabling robots to execute high-level user commands while tracking past actions. It employs three specialized agents: a routing agent, a task planning agent, and a knowledge base agent, each powered by task-specific LLMs. By leveraging in-context learning, our system avoids the need for explicit model training. RAG enables the system to retrieve context from past interactions, enhancing long-term object tracking. A combination of Grounded SAM and LLaMa3.2-Vision provides robust object detection, facilitating semantic scene understanding for task planning. Evaluation across three household scenarios demonstrates high task planning accuracy and an improvement in memory recall due to RAG. Specifically, Qwen2.5 yields best performance for specialized agents, while LLaMA3.1 excels in routing tasks.

Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as sequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their high computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and hardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review that systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains lacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of model compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and hardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging research directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including graphics processing units (GPUs), application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The goal is to inspire further research with a contemporary guide on optimizing ViTs for efficient deployment on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Neurocomputing, Elsevier</p></details> | None |
| **[Semantic Positive Pairs for Enhancing Visual Representation Learning of Instance Discrimination Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16122v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning algorithms (SSL) based on instance discrimination have shown promising results, performing competitively or even outperforming supervised learning counterparts in some downstream tasks. Such approaches employ data augmentation to create two views of the same instance (i.e., positive pairs) and encourage the model to learn good representations by attracting these views closer in the embedding space without collapsing to the trivial solution. However, data augmentation is limited in representing positive pairs, and the repulsion process between the instances during contrastive learning may discard important features for instances that have similar categories. To address this issue, we propose an approach to identify those images with similar semantic content and treat them as positive instances, thereby reducing the chance of discarding important features during representation learning and increasing the richness of the latent representation. Our approach is generic and could work with any self-supervised instance discrimination frameworks such as MoCo and SimSiam. To evaluate our method, we run experiments on three benchmark datasets: ImageNet, STL-10 and CIFAR-10 with different instance discrimination SSL approaches. The experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all three datasets; for instance, we improve upon the vanilla MoCo-v2 by 4.1% on ImageNet under a linear evaluation protocol over 800 epochs. We also report results on semi-supervised learning, transfer learning on downstream tasks, and object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables, V2: fixed typos in the references</p></details> | None |

However, mobility and non-rigid sensor mounts introduce extrinsic calibration errors, necessitating online calibration, further complicated by limited overlap in sensing regions. Moreover, maintaining fresh information is crucial for timely and accurate sensing. To address calibration errors and ensure timely and accurate perception, we propose a robust task-oriented communication strategy to optimize online self-calibration and efficient feature sharing for Real-time Adaptive Collaborative Perception (R-ACP). Specifically, we first formulate an Age of Perceived Targets (AoPT) minimization problem to capture data timeliness of multi-view streaming. Then, in the calibration phase, we introduce a channel-aware self-calibration technique based on reidentification (Re-ID), which adaptively compresses key features according to channel capacities, effectively addressing calibration issues via spatial and temporal cross-camera correlations. In the streaming phase, we tackle the trade-off between bandwidth and inference accuracy by leveraging an Information Bottleneck (IB) based encoding method to adjust video compression rates based on task relevance, thereby reducing communication overhead and latency. Finally, we design a priority-aware network to filter corrupted features to mitigate performance degradation from packet corruption. Extensive studies demonstrate that our framework outperforms five baselines, improving multiple object detection accuracy (MODA) by 25.49% and reducing communication costs by 51.36% under severely poor channel conditions.

In this work, we explore various modeling approaches for FCO detections within microscopic traffic simulations to evaluate their potential for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. These approaches range from 2D raytracing to high-fidelity co-simulations that emulate real-world sensors and integrate 3D object detection algorithms to closely replicate FCO detections. Additionally, we introduce a neural network-based emulation technique that effectively approximates the results of high-fidelity co-simulations. This approach captures the unique characteristics of FCO detections while offering a fast and scalable solution for modeling. Using this emulation method, we investigate the impact of FCO data in a digital twin of a traffic network modeled in SUMO. Results demonstrate that even at a 20% penetration rate, FCOs using LiDAR-based detections can identify 65% of vehicles across various intersections and traffic demand scenarios. Further potential emerges when temporal insights are integrated, enabling the recovery of previously detected but currently unseen vehicles. By employing data-driven methods, we recover over 80% of these vehicles with minimal positional deviations. These findings underscore the potential of FCOs for ITS, particularly in enhancing traffic state estimation and monitoring under varying penetration rates and traffic conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep learning-based anatomical landmark detection in neck US can further facilitate procedural efficiency. However, class imbalance within datasets, where key structures like tracheal rings and vocal folds are underrepresented, presents significant challenges for object detection models. To address this, we propose T2ID-CAS, a hybrid approach that combines a text-to-image latent diffusion model with class-aware sampling to generate high-quality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes. This approach, rarely explored in the ultrasound domain, improves the representation of minority classes. Experimental results using YOLOv9 for anatomical landmark detection in neck US demonstrated that T2ID-CAS achieved a mean Average Precision of 88.2, significantly surpassing the baseline of 66. This highlights its potential as a computationally efficient and scalable solution for mitigating class imbalance in AI-assisted ultrasound-guided interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE EMBC 2025</p></details> | None |

A recent tendency is to investigate pre-trained lightweight models rather than deep neural networks in SOD tasks, coping with applications under limited computational resources. In this context, we have investigated lightweight networks using a methodology named Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM), which assumes that the encoder's kernels can be estimated from marker pixels on discriminative regions of a few representative images. This work proposes flyweight networks, hundreds of times lighter than lightweight models, for SOD by combining a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder, whose weights are estimated for each input image by a given heuristic function. Such FLIM networks are trained from three to four representative images only and without backpropagation, making the models suitable for applications under labeled data constraints as well. We study five adaptive decoders; two of them are introduced here. Differently from the previous ones that rely on one neuron per pixel with shared weights, the heuristic functions of the new adaptive decoders estimate the weights of each neuron per pixel. We compare FLIM models with adaptive decoders for two challenging SOD tasks with three lightweight networks from the state-of-the-art, two FLIM networks with decoders trained by backpropagation, and one FLIM network whose labeled markers define the decoder's weights. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed networks over the baselines, revealing the importance of further investigating such methods in new applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society (JBCS)</p></details> | None |

The initial step in this process involves detecting Protected Health Information (PHI), which can be found in image metadata or imprinted within image pixels. Despite the importance of such systems, there has been limited evaluation of existing AI-based solutions, creating barriers to the development of reliable and robust tools. In this study, we present an AI-based pipeline for PHI detection, comprising three key components: text detection, text extraction, and text analysis. We benchmark three models, YOLOv11, EasyOCR, and GPT-4o, across different setups corresponding to these components, evaluating the performance based on precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. All setups demonstrate excellent PHI detection, with all metrics exceeding 0.9. The combination of YOLOv11 for text localization and GPT-4o for extraction and analysis yields the best results. However, this setup incurs higher costs due to GPT-4o's token generation. Conversely, an end-to-end pipeline that relies solely on GPT-4o shows lower performance but highlights the potential of multimodal models for complex tasks. We recommend fine-tuning a dedicated object detection model and utilizing built-in OCR tools to achieve optimal performance and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, leveraging language models such as GPT-4o can facilitate thorough and flexible analysis of text content.</p></details> | In progress | None |

In the upstream, images serve as raw materials for processing in the detection pipeline, where pre-trained models are employed to generate initial feature maps. In the midstream, an assigner selects training positive and negative samples. Subsequently, these samples and features are fed into the downstream for classification and regression. Previous small object detection methods often focused on improving isolated stages of the pipeline, thereby neglecting holistic optimization and consequently constraining overall performance gains. To address this issue, we have optimized three key aspects, namely Purifying, Labeling, and Utilizing, in this pipeline, proposing a high-quality Small object detection framework termed PLUSNet. Specifically, PLUSNet comprises three sequential components: the Hierarchical Feature Purifier (HFP) for purifying upstream features, the Multiple Criteria Label Assignment (MCLA) for improving the quality of midstream training samples, and the Frequency Decoupled Head (FDHead) for more effectively exploiting information to accomplish downstream tasks. The proposed PLUS modules are readily integrable into various object detectors, thus enhancing their detection capabilities in multi-scale scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed PLUSNet consistently achieves significant and consistent improvements across multiple datasets for small object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods are built upon CNN-based detectors and primarily improve robustness by employing carefully designed data augmentation strategies integrated with feature alignment techniques. However, data augmentation methods have inherent drawbacks; they are only effective when the augmented sample distribution approximates or covers the unseen scenarios, thus failing to enhance generalization across all unseen domains. Furthermore, while the recent Detection Transformer (DETR) has demonstrated superior generalization capability in domain adaptation tasks due to its efficient global information extraction, its potential in SDG tasks remains unexplored. To this end, we introduce a strong DETR-based detector named the Style-Adaptive Detection Transformer (SA-DETR) for SDG in object detection. Specifically, we present a domain style adapter that projects the style representation of the unseen target domain into the training domain, enabling dynamic style adaptation. Then, we propose an object-aware contrastive learning module to guide the detector in extracting domain-invariant features through contrastive learning. By using object-aware gating masks to constrain feature aggregation in both spatial and semantic dimensions, this module achieves cross-domain contrast of instance-level features, thereby enhancing generalization.

Although existing datasets for OOD in UAV provide valuable resources, they are often designed for specific downstream tasks.Consequently, they exhibit limited generalization performance in real flight scenarios and fail to thoroughly demonstrate algorithm effectiveness in practical environments. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce CODrone, a comprehensive oriented object detection dataset for UAVs that accurately reflects real-world conditions. It also serves as a new benchmark designed to align with downstream task requirements, ensuring greater applicability and robustness in UAV-based OOD.Based on application requirements, we identify four key limitations in current UAV OOD datasets-low image resolution, limited object categories, single-view imaging, and restricted flight altitudes-and propose corresponding improvements to enhance their applicability and robustness.Furthermore, CODrone contains a broad spectrum of annotated images collected from multiple cities under various lighting conditions, enhancing the realism of the benchmark. To rigorously evaluate CODrone as a new benchmark and gain deeper insights into the novel challenges it presents, we conduct a series of experiments based on 22 classical or SOTA methods.Our evaluation not only assesses the effectiveness of CODrone in real-world scenarios but also highlights key bottlenecks and opportunities to advance OOD in UAV applications.Overall, CODrone fills the data gap in OOD from UAV perspective and provides a benchmark with enhanced generalization capability, better aligning with practical applications and future algorithm development.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods like YOLO11, while proficient in spatial feature extraction for precise detection, often struggle with these small and dynamically moving objects, particularly in handling real-time data updates and resource efficiency. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework that integrates dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) with YOLO11 to address these limitations. Unlike standard GNNs, DGNNs are chosen for their superior ability to dynamically update graph structures in real-time, which enables adaptive and robust tracking of objects in highly variable urban traffic scenarios. This framework constructs and regularly updates its graph representations, capturing objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thus effectively responding to rapidly changing conditions. Additionally, DGNN-YOLO incorporates Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques to enhance interpretability and foster trust, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. Extensive experiments validate the framework's performance, achieving a precision of 0.8382, recall of 0.6875, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.6476, significantly outperforming existing methods. This study offers a scalable and interpretable solution for real-time traffic surveillance and significantly advances intelligent transportation systems' capabilities by addressing the critical challenge of detecting and tracking small, occluded objects.</p></details> |  | None |

The study presents experiments on training specialists for image classification and object detection tasks. The results demonstrate that specialization can enhance a generalist's accuracy even without additional data or changing training regimes: solely by constraining class label space in which the network performs. Theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that effective specialization requires modifying traditional fine-tuning methods and constraining data space to semantically coherent subsets. The specialist extraction phase before tuning the network is proposed for maximal performance gains. We also provide analysis of the evolution of the feature space during specialization. This study paves way to future research for developing more advanced dynamically configurable image analysis systems, where computations depend on the specific input. Additionally, the proposed methods can help improve system performance in scenarios where certain data domains should be excluded from consideration of the generalist network.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Explicit Motion Handling and Interactive Prompting for Video Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01968v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflage poses challenges in distinguishing a static target, whereas any movement of the target can break this disguise. Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) approaches take noisy motion estimation as input or model motion implicitly, restricting detection performance in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel Explicit Motion handling and Interactive Prompting framework for VCOD, dubbed EMIP, which handles motion cues explicitly using a frozen pre-trained optical flow fundamental model. EMIP is characterized by a two-stream architecture for simultaneously conducting camouflaged segmentation and optical flow estimation. Interactions across the dual streams are realized in an interactive prompting way that is inspired by emerging visual prompt learning. Two learnable modules, i.e., the camouflaged feeder and motion collector, are designed to incorporate segmentation-to-motion and motion-to-segmentation prompts, respectively, and enhance outputs of the both streams. The prompt fed to the motion stream is learned by supervising optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we show that long-term historical information can also be incorporated as a prompt into EMIP and achieve more robust results with temporal consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our EMIP achieves new state-of-the-art records on popular VCOD benchmarks.

However, modern ConvNets remain confined to a pyramid structure that successively downsamples the feature map for receptive field expansion, neglecting this crucial biomimetic principle. We present OverLoCK, the first pure ConvNet backbone architecture that explicitly incorporates a top-down attention mechanism. Unlike pyramid backbone networks, our design features a branched architecture with three synergistic sub-networks: 1) a Base-Net that encodes low/mid-level features; 2) a lightweight Overview-Net that generates dynamic top-down attention through coarse global context modeling (i.e., overview first); and 3) a robust Focus-Net that performs finer-grained perception guided by top-down attention (i.e., look closely next). To fully unleash the power of top-down attention, we further propose a novel context-mixing dynamic convolution (ContMix) that effectively models long-range dependencies while preserving inherent local inductive biases even when the input resolution increases, addressing critical limitations in existing convolutions. Our OverLoCK exhibits a notable performance improvement over existing methods. For instance, OverLoCK-T achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 84.2%, significantly surpassing ConvNeXt-B while using only around one-third of the FLOPs/parameters. On object detection, our OverLoCK-S clearly surpasses MogaNet-B by 1% in AP^b. On semantic segmentation, our OverLoCK-T remarkably improves UniRepLKNet-T by 1.7% in mIoU.

Its architectural flexibility and capabilities have made it a preferred choice among researchers and practitioners. However, the intricate multi-head attention mechanism of ViT presents significant challenges to interpretability, as the underlying prediction process remains opaque. A critical limitation arises from an observation commonly noted in transformer architectures: "Not all attention heads are equally meaningful." Overlooking the relative importance of specific heads highlights the limitations of existing interpretability methods. To address these challenges, we introduce Gradient-Driven Multi-Head Attention Rollout (GMAR), a novel method that quantifies the importance of each attention head using gradient-based scores. These scores are normalized to derive a weighted aggregate attention score, effectively capturing the relative contributions of individual heads. GMAR clarifies the role of each head in the prediction process, enabling more precise interpretability at the head level. Experimental results demonstrate that GMAR consistently outperforms traditional attention rollout techniques. This work provides a practical contribution to transformer-based architectures, establishing a robust framework for enhancing the interpretability of Vision Transformer models.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often address these challenges separately, overlooking the intricate nature of UAV images and the potential synergy between them. In response, this paper proposes AD-Det, a novel framework employing a coherent coarse-to-fine strategy that seamlessly integrates two pivotal components: Adaptive Small Object Enhancement (ASOE) and Dynamic Class-balanced Copy-paste (DCC). ASOE utilizes a high-resolution feature map to identify and cluster regions containing small objects. These regions are subsequently enlarged and processed by a fine-grained detector. On the other hand, DCC conducts object-level resampling by dynamically pasting tail classes around the cluster centers obtained by ASOE, main-taining a dynamic memory bank for each tail class. This approach enables AD-Det to not only extract regions with small objects for precise detection but also dynamically perform reasonable resampling for tail-class objects. Consequently, AD-Det enhances the overall detection performance by addressing the challenges of scale variations and class imbalance in UAV images through a synergistic and adaptive framework. We extensively evaluate our approach on two public datasets, i.e., VisDrone and UAVDT, and demonstrate that AD-Det significantly outperforms existing competitive alternatives. Notably, AD-Det achieves a 37.5% Average Precision (AP) on the VisDrone dataset, surpassing its counterparts by at least 3.1%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Remote Sensing</p></details> | None |

Our research aims to lower these barriers by combining generative AI and augmented reality (AR) into a cohesive system that allows users to easily generate, manipulate, and interact with 3D models in real time, directly within AR environments. Utilizing cutting-edge AI models like Shap-E, we address the complex challenges of transforming 2D images into 3D representations in AR environments. Key challenges such as object isolation, handling intricate backgrounds, and achieving seamless user interaction are tackled through advanced object detection methods, such as Mask R-CNN. Evaluation results from 35 participants reveal an overall System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 69.64, with participants who engaged with AR/VR technologies more frequently rating the system significantly higher, at 80.71.

This absence of consensus hinders both the comparative analysis of methods and the informed selection of suitable approaches. To address this gap, we introduce the Object Detection Explainable AI Evaluation (ODExAI), a comprehensive framework designed to assess XAI methods in object detection based on three core dimensions: localization accuracy, faithfulness to model behavior, and computational complexity. We benchmark a set of XAI methods across two widely used object detectors (YOLOX and Faster R-CNN) and standard datasets (MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC). Empirical results demonstrate that region-based methods (e.g., D-CLOSE) achieve strong localization (PG = 88.49%) and high model faithfulness (OA = 0.863), though with substantial computational overhead (Time = 71.42s). On the other hand, CAM-based methods (e.g., G-CAME) achieve superior localization (PG = 96.13%) and significantly lower runtime (Time = 0.54s), but at the expense of reduced faithfulness (OA = 0.549). These findings demonstrate critical trade-offs among existing XAI approaches and reinforce the need for task-specific evaluation when deploying them in object detection pipelines.

With the success of large-scale Vision-Language Models, recent S-DGOD approaches exploit pre-trained vision-language knowledge to guide invariant feature learning across visual domains. However, the utilized knowledge remains at a coarse-grained level~(e.g., the textual description of adverse weather paired with the image) and serves as an implicit regularization for guidance, struggling to learn accurate region- and object-level features in varying domains. In this work, we propose a new cross-modal feature learning method, which can capture generalized and discriminative regional features for S-DGOD tasks. The core of our method is the mechanism of Cross-modal and Region-aware Feature Interaction, which simultaneously learns both inter-modal and intra-modal regional invariance through dynamic interactions between fine-grained textual and visual features. Moreover, we design a simple but effective strategy called Cross-domain Proposal Refining and Mixing, which aligns the position of region proposals across multiple domains and diversifies them, enhancing the localization ability of detectors in unseen scenarios. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on S-DGOD benchmark datasets, with improvements of +8.8\%~mPC on Cityscapes-C and +7.9\%~mPC on DWD over baselines, demonstrating its efficacy.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper focuses on the task of object detection in the setting where object classes follow a natural long-tailed distribution. Existing methods for long-tailed detection resort to external ImageNet labels to augment the low-shot training instances. However, such dependency on a large labeled database has limited utility in practical scenarios. We propose a versatile and scalable approach to leverage optional unlabeled images, which are easy to collect without the burden of human annotations. Our SimLTD framework is straightforward and intuitive, and consists of three simple steps: (1) pre-training on abundant head classes; (2) transfer learning on scarce tail classes; and (3) fine-tuning on a sampled set of both head and tail classes. Our approach can be viewed as an improved head-to-tail model transfer paradigm without the added complexities of meta-learning or knowledge distillation, as was required in past research. By harnessing supplementary unlabeled images, without extra image labels, SimLTD establishes new record results on the challenging LVIS v1 benchmark across both supervised and semi-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

To emulate this capability, the perception pipeline of such systems must integrate information cues from tasks including optical flow and depth estimation, object detection and tracking, and segmentation, among others. However, the conventional approach of employing slow, synchronous inputs from standard frame-based cameras constrains these perception capabilities, particularly during high-speed maneuvers. Recently, event-based sensors have emerged as low latency and low energy alternatives to standard frame-based cameras for capturing high-speed motion, effectively speeding up perception and hence navigation. For coherence, all the perception tasks must be trained on the same input data. However, present-day datasets are curated mainly for a single or a handful of tasks and are limited in the rate of the provided ground truths. To address these limitations, we present Flying Event Dataset fOr Reactive behAviour (FEDORA) - a fully synthetic dataset for perception tasks, with raw data from frame-based cameras, event-based cameras, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), along with ground truths for depth, pose, and optical flow at a rate much higher than existing datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2024</p></details> | None |

However, centralized deep learning (DL) approaches for semantic segmentation raise privacy and scalability challenges, particularly when handling sensitive data. This research presents a new federated learning (FL) framework that integrates secure deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Differential Privacy (DP) to address these issues. The core contribution of this work involves: (1) developing a new hybrid UNet-ResNet34 architecture for centralized semantic segmentation to achieve high accuracy and tackle privacy concerns due to centralized training, and (2) implementing the privacy-preserving FL model, distributed across AVs to enhance performance through secure CNNs and DP mechanisms. In the proposed FL framework, the methodology distinguishes itself from the existing approach through the following: (a) ensuring data decentralization through FL to uphold user privacy by eliminating the need for centralized data aggregation, (b) integrating DP mechanisms to secure sensitive model updates against potential adversarial inference attacks, and (c) evaluating the frameworks performance and generalizability using RGB and semantic segmentation datasets derived from the CARLA simulator. Experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy, from 81.5% to 88.7% for the RGB dataset and from 79.3% to 86.9% for the SEG dataset over 20 to 70 Communication Rounds (CRs). Global loss was reduced by over 60%, and minor accuracy trade-offs from DP were observed. This study contributes by offering a scalable, privacy-preserving FL framework tailored for AVs, optimizing communication efficiency while balancing performance and data security.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in Scientific Reports</p></details> | None |

This study introduces the DRone-derived Intelligence For Traffic analysis (DRIFT) dataset, a large-scale urban traffic dataset collected systematically from synchronized drone videos at approximately 250 meters altitude, covering nine interconnected intersections in Daejeon, South Korea. DRIFT provides high-resolution vehicle trajectories that include directional information, processed through video synchronization and orthomap alignment, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 81,699 vehicle trajectories. Through our DRIFT dataset, researchers can simultaneously analyze traffic at multiple scales - from individual vehicle maneuvers like lane-changes and safety metrics such as time-to-collision to aggregate network flow dynamics across interconnected urban intersections. The DRIFT dataset is structured to enable immediate use without additional preprocessing, complemented by open-source models for object detection and trajectory extraction, as well as associated analytical tools. DRIFT is expected to significantly contribute to academic research and practical applications, such as traffic flow analysis and simulation studies.

Nevertheless, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a challenging task that has received significant attention in recent years. Specifically, OOD detection refers to the detection of instances that do not belong to the training distribution, while still having good performance on the in-distribution task (e.g., classification or object detection). Recent work has focused on generating synthetic outliers and using them to train an outlier detector, generally achieving improved OOD detection than traditional OOD methods. In this regard, outliers can be generated either in feature or pixel space. Feature space driven methods have shown strong performance on both the classification and object detection tasks, at the expense that the visualization of training outliers remains unknown, making further analysis on OOD failure modes challenging. On the other hand, pixel space outlier generation techniques enabled by diffusion models have been used for image classification using, providing improved OOD detection performance and outlier visualization, although their adaption to the object detection task is as yet unexplored. We therefore introduce Dream-Box, a method that provides a link to object-wise outlier generation in the pixel space for OOD detection. Specifically, we use diffusion models to generate object-wise outliers that are used to train an object detector for an in-distribution task and OOD detection. Our method achieves comparable performance to previous traditional methods while being the first technique to provide concrete visualization of generated OOD objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, LatinX in AI CVPR 2025 Workshop</p></details> | None |

Comprising a 1-hour video (67,760 frames) of eight Holstein Friesian calves with unique coat patterns and 900 static frames, the dataset emphasizes real-world challenges like prolonged occlusions, motion blur, and pose variation. By fine-tuning 28 object detectors (YOLO variants, transformers) and evaluating 23 pretrained backbones (ResNet, ConvNextV2, ViTs), we expose critical architectural trade-offs: smaller models (e.g., ConvNextV2 Nano, 15.6M parameters) excel in efficiency and retrieval accuracy, while pure vision transformers lag in occlusion-heavy settings. The dataset's structured design-fixed camera views, natural motion, and verified identities-provides a reproducible testbed for object detection challenges (mAP50:95: 56.5-66.4%), bridging synthetic simplicity and domain-specific complexity.

Therefore, vision models have to behave in a robust way to disturbances such as noise or blur. While seminal benchmarks exist to evaluate model robustness to diverse corruptions, blur is often approximated in an overly simplistic way to model defocus, while ignoring the different blur kernel shapes that result from optical systems. To study model robustness against realistic optical blur effects, this paper proposes two datasets of blur corruptions, which we denote OpticsBench and LensCorruptions. OpticsBench examines primary aberrations such as coma, defocus, and astigmatism, i.e. aberrations that can be represented by varying a single parameter of Zernike polynomials. To go beyond the principled but synthetic setting of primary aberrations, LensCorruptions samples linear combinations in the vector space spanned by Zernike polynomials, corresponding to 100 real lenses. Evaluations for image classification and object detection on ImageNet and MSCOCO show that for a variety of different pre-trained models, the performance on OpticsBench and LensCorruptions varies significantly, indicating the need to consider realistic image corruptions to evaluate a model's robustness against blur.</p></details> | v1.0 | None |

As any visual changes in the scene produce event data, it is paramount to classify the data into different motions (i.e., motion segmentation), which is useful for various tasks such as object detection and visual servoing. We propose an iterative motion segmentation method, by classifying events into background (e.g., dominant motion hypothesis) and foreground (independent motion residuals), thus extending the Contrast Maximization framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully classifies event clusters both for public and self-recorded datasets, producing sharp, motion-compensated edge-like images. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on moving object detection benchmarks with an improvement of over 30%, and demonstrates its possibility of applying to more complex and noisy real-world scenes.

Our solution can be plugged on top of any underlying single-modal detectors, enabling a flexible training process that can take advantage of pre-trained LiDAR and RGB detectors, or train the two branches separately.

For example, if a model is 80% sure of an outcome, is it correct 80% of the time? Probability calibration metrics measure the discrepancy between confidence and accuracy, providing an independent assessment of model calibration performance that complements traditional accuracy metrics. Understanding calibration is important when the outputs of multiple systems are combined, for assurance in safety or business-critical contexts, and for building user trust in models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of probability calibration metrics for classifier and object detection models, organising them according to a number of different categorisations to highlight their relationships. We identify 82 major metrics, which can be grouped into four classifier families (point-based, bin-based, kernel or curve-based, and cumulative) and an object detection family. For each metric, we provide equations where available, facilitating implementation and comparison by future researchers.</p></details> | 60 pages, 7 figures | None |

A key component of automation is robust long-range perception, essential for early hazard detection, such as obstacles at level crossings or pedestrians on tracks. Unlike automotive systems with braking distances of ~70 meters, trains require perception ranges exceeding 1 km. This paper presents an deep-learning-based approach for long-range 3D object detection tailored for autonomous trains. The method relies solely on monocular images, inspired by the Faraway-Frustum approach, and incorporates LiDAR data during training to improve depth estimation. The proposed pipeline consists of four key modules: (1) a modified YOLOv9 for 2.5D object detection, (2) a depth estimation network, and (3-4) dedicated short- and long-range 3D detection heads. Evaluations on the OSDaR23 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in detecting objects up to 250 meters.

Traditional computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation, focus on concrete visual representations, while intent recognition relies more on implicit visual clues. This poses challenges due to the wide variation and subjectivity of such clues, compounded by the problem of intra-class variety in conveying abstract concepts, e.g. "enjoy life". Existing methods seek to solve the problem by manually designing representative features or building prototypes for each class from global features. However, these methods still struggle to deal with the large visual diversity of each intent category. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach named Multi-grained Compositional visual Clue Learning (MCCL) to address these challenges for image intent recognition. Our method leverages the systematic compositionality of human cognition by breaking down intent recognition into visual clue composition and integrating multi-grained features. We adopt class-specific prototypes to alleviate data imbalance. We treat intent recognition as a multi-label classification problem, using a graph convolutional network to infuse prior knowledge through label embedding correlations. Demonstrated by a state-of-the-art performance on the Intentonomy and MDID datasets, our approach advances the accuracy of existing methods while also possessing good interpretability. Our work provides an attempt for future explorations in understanding complex and miscellaneous forms of human expression.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[E-InMeMo: Enhanced Prompting for Visual In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18158v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale models trained on extensive datasets have become the standard due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks. In-context learning (ICL), widely used in natural language processing, leverages these models by providing task-specific prompts without modifying their parameters. This paradigm is increasingly being adapted for computer vision, where models receive an input-output image pair, known as an in-context pair, alongside a query image to illustrate the desired output. However, the success of visual ICL largely hinges on the quality of these prompts. To address this, we propose Enhanced Instruct Me More (E-InMeMo), a novel approach that incorporates learnable perturbations into in-context pairs to optimize prompting. Through extensive experiments on standard vision tasks, E-InMeMo demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it improves mIoU scores by 7.99 for foreground segmentation and by 17.04 for single object detection when compared to the baseline without learnable prompts. These results highlight E-InMeMo as a lightweight yet effective strategy for enhancing visual ICL.

| **[MASF-YOLO: An Improved YOLOv11 Network for Small Object Detection on Drone View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18136v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and computer vision technologies, object detection from UAV perspectives has emerged as a prominent research area. However, challenges for detection brought by the extremely small proportion of target pixels, significant scale variations of objects, and complex background information in UAV images have greatly limited the practical applications of UAV. To address these challenges, we propose a novel object detection network Multi-scale Context Aggregation and Scale-adaptive Fusion YOLO (MASF-YOLO), which is developed based on YOLOv11. Firstly, to tackle the difficulty of detecting small objects in UAV images, we design a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM), which significantly improves the detection accuracy of small objects through parallel multi-scale convolutions and feature fusion. Secondly, to mitigate the interference of background noise, we propose an Improved Efficient Multi-scale Attention Module (IEMA), which enhances the focus on target regions through feature grouping, parallel sub-networks, and cross-spatial learning. Thirdly, we introduce a Dimension-Aware Selective Integration Module (DASI), which further enhances multi-scale feature fusion capabilities by adaptively weighting and fusing low-dimensional features and high-dimensional features. Finally, we conducted extensive performance evaluations of our proposed method on the VisDrone2019 dataset. Compared to YOLOv11-s, MASFYOLO-s achieves improvements of 4.6% in mAP@0.5 and 3.5% in mAP@0.5:0.95 on the VisDrone2019 validation set. Remarkably, MASF-YOLO-s outperforms YOLOv11-m while requiring only approximately 60% of its parameters and 65% of its computational cost. Furthermore, comparative experiments with state-of-the-art detectors confirm that MASF-YOLO-s maintains a clear competitive advantage in both detection accuracy and model efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing solutions either rely on small models that struggle with generalization or large models that are resource-intensive. While collaboration between the two offers a promising solution, the key challenge is deciding when and how to engage the large model. To address this issue, this paper proposes opportunistic collaborative planning (OCP), which seamlessly integrates efficient local models with powerful cloud models through two key innovations. First, we propose large vision model guided model predictive control (LVM-MPC), which leverages the cloud for LVM perception and decision making. The cloud output serves as a global guidance for a local MPC, thereby forming a closed-loop perception-to-control system. Second, to determine the best timing for large model query and service, we propose collaboration timing optimization (CTO), including object detection confidence thresholding (ODCT) and cloud forward simulation (CFS), to decide when to seek cloud assistance and when to offer cloud service. Extensive experiments show that the proposed OCP outperforms existing methods in terms of both navigation time and success rate.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Direct sampling method to retrieve small objects from two-dimensional limited-aperture scattered field data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18036v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we investigated the application of the direct sampling method (DSM) to identify small dielectric objects in a limited-aperture inverse scattering problem. Unlike previous studies, we consider the bistatic measurement configuration corresponding to the transmitter location and design indicator functions for both a single source and multiple sources, and we convert the unknown measurement data to a fixed nonzero constant. To explain the applicability and limitation of object detection, we demonstrate that the indicator functions can be expressed by an infinite series of Bessel functions, the material properties of the objects, the bistatic angle, and the converted constant. Based on the theoretical results, we explain how the imaging performance of the DSM is influenced by the bistatic angle and the converted constant. In addition, the results of our analyses demonstrate that a smaller bistatic angle enhances the imaging accuracy and that optimal selection of the converted constant is crucial to realize reliable object detection. The results of the numerical simulations obtained using a two-dimensional Fresnel dataset validated the theoretical findings and illustrate the effectiveness and limitations of the designed indicator functions for small objects.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures | None |

However, the reliability of such structures has not been sufficiently analyzed, which poses them to the risk of imperceptible perturbations that can significantly hinder their performance. In this work, we show that state-of-the-art image-to-image dehazing transformers are susceptible to adversarial noise, with even 1 pixel change being able to decrease the PSNR by as much as 2.8 dB. Next, we propose two lightweight fine-tuning strategies aimed at increasing the robustness of pre-trained transformers. Our methods results in comparable clean performance, while significantly increasing the protection against adversarial data. We further present their applicability in two remote sensing scenarios, showcasing their robust behavior for out-of-distribution data. The source code for adversarial fine-tuning and attack algorithms can be found at github.com/Vladimirescu/RobustDehazing.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](http://github.com/Vladimirescu/RobustDehazing) |
| **[Large-image Object Detection for Fine-grained Recognition of Punches Patterns in Medieval Panel Painting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12489v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The attribution of the author of an art piece is typically a laborious manual process, usually relying on subjective evaluations of expert figures. However, there are some situations in which quantitative features of the artwork can support these evaluations. The extraction of these features can sometimes be automated, for instance, with the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. An example of these features is represented by repeated, mechanically impressed patterns, called punches, present chiefly in 13th and 14th-century panel paintings from Tuscany. Previous research in art history showcased a strong connection between the shapes of punches and specific artists or workshops, suggesting the possibility of using these quantitative cues to support the attribution. In the present work, we first collect a dataset of large-scale images of these panel paintings. Then, using YOLOv10, a recent and popular object detection model, we train a ML pipeline to perform object detection on the punches contained in the images. Due to the large size of the images, the detection procedure is split across multiple frames by adopting a sliding-window approach with overlaps, after which the predictions are combined for the whole image using a custom non-maximal suppression routine. Our results indicate how art historians working in the field can reliably use our method for the identification and extraction of punches.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper studies the problem of leveraging pretrained diffusion models for performing discriminative tasks. Specifically, we extend the discriminative capability of pretrained frozen generative diffusion models from the classification task to the more complex object detection task, by "inverting" a pretrained layout-to-image diffusion model. To this end, a gradient-based discrete optimization approach for replacing the heavy prediction enumeration process, and a prior distribution model for making more accurate use of the Bayes' rule, are proposed respectively. Empirical results show that this method is on par with basic discriminative object detection baselines on COCO dataset. In addition, our method can greatly speed up the previous diffusion-based method for classification without sacrificing accuracy.

Perspective-taking, the ability to perceive an environment or situation from an alternative viewpoint, is a key benchmark for human-level visual understanding, essential for environmental interaction and collaboration with autonomous agents. Despite advancements in spatial reasoning within VLMs, recent research has shown that modern VLMs significantly lack perspective-aware reasoning capabilities and exhibit a strong bias toward egocentric interpretations. To bridge the gap between VLMs and human perception, we focus on the role of mental imagery, where humans perceive the world through abstracted representations that facilitate perspective shifts. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for perspective-aware reasoning, named Abstract Perspective Change (APC), that effectively leverages vision foundation models, such as object detection, segmentation, and orientation estimation, to construct scene abstractions and enable perspective transformations. Our experiments on synthetic and real-image benchmarks, compared with various VLMs, demonstrate significant improvements in perspective-aware reasoning with our framework, further outperforming fine-tuned spatial reasoning models and novel-view-synthesis-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://apc-vlm.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, even when trained using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the "long-tail challenge", due to the distribution of data including many instances that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures.

In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have similar rankings on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21--29% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still -35% behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023), and the 2D detection stage is consequently the main bottleneck of existing pipelines for 6D localization/detection of unseen objects.

| **[Scene-Aware Location Modeling for Data Augmentation in Automotive Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17076v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative image models are increasingly being used for training data augmentation in vision tasks. In the context of automotive object detection, methods usually focus on producing augmented frames that look as realistic as possible, for example by replacing real objects with generated ones. Others try to maximize the diversity of augmented frames, for example by pasting lots of generated objects onto existing backgrounds. Both perspectives pay little attention to the locations of objects in the scene. Frame layouts are either reused with little or no modification, or they are random and disregard realism entirely. In this work, we argue that optimal data augmentation should also include realistic augmentation of layouts. We introduce a scene-aware probabilistic location model that predicts where new objects can realistically be placed in an existing scene. By then inpainting objects in these locations with a generative model, we obtain much stronger augmentation performance than existing approaches. We set a new state of the art for generative data augmentation on two automotive object detection tasks, achieving up to $2.8\times$ higher gains than the best competing approach ($+1.4$ vs. $+0.5$ mAP boost). We also demonstrate significant improvements for instance segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

We utilize recent advancements in 3D reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting for 3D object placement in driving scenes. Unlike existing diffusion-based methods that synthesize images conditioned on BEV layouts, our approach places 3D objects directly in the reconstructed 3D space with explicitly imposed geometric transformations. This ensures both the physical plausibility of object placement and highly accurate 3D pose and position annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that even by integrating a limited number of external 3D objects into real scenes, the augmented data significantly enhances 3D object detection performance and outperforms existing diffusion-based 3D augmentation for object detection. Extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset reveals that imposing high geometric diversity in object placement has a greater impact compared to the appearance diversity of objects. Additionally, we show that generating hard examples, either by maximizing detection loss or imposing high visual occlusion in camera images, does not lead to more efficient 3D data augmentation for camera-based 3D object detection in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the recent advancement in GNN-based perception methods, they are prone to use straightforward pairwise connectivity mechanisms in the pure Euclidean space where they struggle to capture long-range dependencies and fail to effectively characterize the inherent hierarchical structures of non-uniformly distributed event stream. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel approach named EHGCN, which is a pioneer to perceive event stream in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces for event vision. In EHGCN, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically regulate sampling rates, retaining discriminative events while attenuating chaotic noise. Then we present a Markov Vector Field (MVF)-driven motion-aware hyperedge generation method based on motion state transition probabilities, thereby eliminating cross-target spurious associations and providing critically topological priors while capturing long-range dependencies between events. Finally, we propose a Euclidean-Hyperbolic GCN to fuse the information locally aggregated and globally hierarchically modeled in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, respectively, to achieve hybrid event perception. Experimental results on event perception tasks such as object detection and recognition validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method integrates instance segmentation with generative inpainting to remove identifiable entities while preserving scene integrity. Extensive evaluations on 2D COCO-based object detection show that ROAR achieves 87.5% of the baseline detection average precision (AP), whereas image dropping achieves only 74.2% of the baseline AP, highlighting the advantage of scrubbing in preserving dataset utility. The degradation is even more severe for small objects due to occlusion and loss of fine-grained details. Furthermore, in NeRF-based 3D reconstruction, our method incurs a PSNR loss of at most 1.66 dB while maintaining SSIM and improving LPIPS, demonstrating superior perceptual quality. Our findings establish object removal as an effective privacy framework, achieving strong privacy guarantees with minimal performance trade-offs. The results highlight key challenges in generative inpainting, occlusion-robust segmentation, and task-specific scrubbing, setting the foundation for future advancements in privacy-preserving vision systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Model (VFM) within an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to enhance feature integration. This design captures detailed global representations and preserves essential spectral characteristics, treating RGB-to-NIR translation as more than a simple domain transfer problem. A multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator ensures realistic image generation at various detail levels, while carefully designed loss functions couple global context understanding with local feature preservation. We performed experiments on the RANUS dataset to demonstrate Pix2Next's advantages in quantitative metrics and visual quality, improving the FID score by 34.81% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of Pix2Next by showing improved performance on a downstream object detection task using generated NIR data to augment limited real NIR datasets. The proposed approach enables the scaling up of NIR datasets without additional data acquisition or annotation efforts, potentially accelerating advancements in NIR-based computer vision applications.</p></details> | 19 pages,12 figures | None |

This study presents a deep learning-based model for detecting cattle lameness, sickness, or gait abnormalities using publicly available video data. The dataset consists of 50 unique videos from 40 individual cattle, recorded from various angles in both indoor and outdoor environments. Half of the dataset represents naturally walking (normal/non-lame) cattle, while the other half consists of cattle exhibiting gait abnormalities (lame). To enhance model robustness and generalizability, data augmentation was applied to the training data. The pre-processed videos were then classified using two deep learning models: ConvLSTM2D and 3D CNN. A comparative analysis of the results demonstrates strong classification performance. Specifically, the 3D CNN model achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 90.9%, 90.9%, and 90.91% respectively. The ConvLSTM2D model exhibited a slightly lower accuracy of 85%. This study highlights the effectiveness of directly applying classification models to learn spatiotemporal features from video data, offering an alternative to traditional multi-stage approaches that typically involve object detection, pose estimation, and feature extraction. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the proposed deep learning models, particularly the 3D CNN, effectively classify and detect lameness in cattle while simplifying the processing pipeline.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods have focused on dealing with feature misalignment caused by the domain gap between radar and camera. However, existing methods either neglect inter-modal features interaction during alignment or fail to effectively align features at the same spatial location across modalities. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a new alignment model called Radar Camera Alignment (RCAlign). Specifically, we design a Dual-Route Alignment (DRA) module based on contrastive learning to align and fuse the features between radar and camera. Moreover, considering the sparsity of radar BEV features, a Radar Feature Enhancement (RFE) module is proposed to improve the densification of radar BEV features with the knowledge distillation loss. Experiments show RCAlign achieves a new state-of-the-art on the public nuScenes benchmark in radar camera fusion for 3D Object Detection. Furthermore, the RCAlign achieves a significant performance gain (4.3\% NDS and 8.4\% mAP) in real-time 3D detection compared to the latest state-of-the-art method (RCBEVDet).</p></details> |  | None |

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive results for end-to-end robot control, it remains an open question how far such models can generalize in the wild. We describe $\pi_{0.5}$, a new model based on $\pi_{0}$ that uses co-training on heterogeneous tasks to enable broad generalization. $\pi_{0.5}$\ uses data from multiple robots, high-level semantic prediction, web data, and other sources to enable broadly generalizable real-world robotic manipulation. Our system uses a combination of co-training and hybrid multi-modal examples that combine image observations, language commands, object detections, semantic subtask prediction, and low-level actions. Our experiments show that this kind of knowledge transfer is essential for effective generalization, and we demonstrate for the first time that an end-to-end learning-enabled robotic system can perform long-horizon and dexterous manipulation skills, such as cleaning a kitchen or bedroom, in entirely new homes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, inherent limitations of IR images, such as the lack of color and texture cues, pose challenges for RGB-trained models, leading to increased false positives and poor-quality pseudo-labels. To address this, we propose Semantic-Aware Gray color Augmentation (SAGA), a novel strategy for mitigating color bias and bridging the domain gap by extracting object-level features relevant to IR images. Additionally, to validate the proposed SAGA for drone imagery, we introduce the IndraEye, a multi-sensor (RGB-IR) dataset designed for diverse applications. The dataset contains 5,612 images with 145,666 instances, captured from diverse angles, altitudes, backgrounds, and times of day, offering valuable opportunities for multimodal learning, domain adaptation for object detection and segmentation, and exploration of sensor-specific strengths and weaknesses. IndraEye aims to enhance the development of more robust and accurate aerial perception systems, especially in challenging environments. Experimental results show that SAGA significantly improves RGB-to-IR adaptation for autonomous driving and IndraEye dataset, achieving consistent performance gains of +0.4% to +7.6% (mAP) when integrated with state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

To address this, we propose an Ultra-Light Real-Time Underwater Object Detection framework, You Sense Only Once Beneath (YSOOB). Specifically, we utilize a Multi-Spectrum Wavelet Encoder (MSWE) to perform frequency-domain encoding on the input image, minimizing the semantic loss caused by underwater optical color distortion. Furthermore, we revisit the unique characteristics of even-sized and transposed convolutions, allowing the model to dynamically select and enhance key information during the resampling process, thereby improving its generalization ability. Finally, we eliminate model redundancy through a simple yet effective channel compression and reconstructed large kernel convolution (RLKC) to achieve model lightweight. As a result, forms a high-performance underwater object detector YSOOB with only 1.2 million parameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that, with the fewest parameters, YSOOB achieves mAP50 of 83.1% and 82.9% on the URPC2020 and DUO datasets, respectively, comparable to the current SOTA detectors. The inference speed reaches 781.3 FPS and 57.8 FPS on the T4 GPU (TensorRT FP16) and the edge computing device Jetson Xavier NX (TensorRT FP16), surpassing YOLOv12-N by 28.1% and 22.5%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

The prosthesis features an anthropomorphic appearance, multi-articulating functionality, and a lightweight design that mimics a natural hand, making it both accessible and affordable for low-income families. Using 3D printing technology and integrating advanced machine vision, sensing, and embedded computing, the prosthetic hand offers a low-cost, customizable solution that addresses the limitations of current myoelectric prostheses. A micro camera is interfaced with a low-power FPGA for real-time object detection and assists with precise grasping. The onboard DL-based object detection and grasp classification models achieved accuracies of 96% and 100% respectively. In the force prediction, the mean absolute error was found to be 0.018. The features of the proposed prosthetic hand can thus be summarized as: a) a wrist-mounted micro camera for artificial sensing, enabling a wide range of hand-based tasks; b) real-time object detection and distance estimation for precise grasping; and c) ultra-low-power operation that delivers high performance within constrained power and resource limits.</p></details> |  | None |

While traditional planners and classical optimisation methods have been extensively used to address this dynamic problem, they often face real-time, unpredictable changes that ultimately leads to sub-optimal performance in terms of adaptiveness and real-time decision making. In this work, we propose a novel motion planner, AgilePilot, based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that is trained in dynamic conditions, coupled with real-time Computer Vision (CV) for object detections during flight. The training-to-deployment framework bridges the Sim2Real gap, leveraging sophisticated reward structures that promotes both safety and agility depending upon environment conditions. The system can rapidly adapt to changing environments, while achieving a maximum speed of 3.0 m/s in real-world scenarios. In comparison, our approach outperforms classical algorithms such as Artificial Potential Field (APF) based motion planner by 3 times, both in performance and tracking accuracy of dynamic targets by using velocity predictions while exhibiting 90% success rate in 75 conducted experiments. This work highlights the effectiveness of DRL in tackling real-time dynamic navigation challenges, offering intelligent safety and agility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript has been accepted at 2025 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (ICUAS)</p></details> | None |
| **[TSceneJAL: Joint Active Learning of Traffic Scenes for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18870v3)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most autonomous driving (AD) datasets incur substantial costs for collection and labeling, inevitably yielding a plethora of low-quality and redundant data instances, thereby compromising performance and efficiency. Many applications in AD systems necessitate high-quality training datasets using both existing datasets and newly collected data. In this paper, we propose a traffic scene joint active learning (TSceneJAL) framework that can efficiently sample the balanced, diverse, and complex traffic scenes from both labeled and unlabeled data. The novelty of this framework is threefold: 1) a scene sampling scheme based on a category entropy, to identify scenes containing multiple object classes, thus mitigating class imbalance for the active learner; 2) a similarity sampling scheme, estimated through the directed graph representation and a marginalize kernel algorithm, to pick sparse and diverse scenes; 3) an uncertainty sampling scheme, predicted by a mixture density network, to select instances with the most unclear or complex regression outcomes for the learner. Finally, the integration of these three schemes in a joint selection strategy yields an optimal and valuable subdataset. Experiments on the KITTI, Lyft, nuScenes and SUScape datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 3D object detection tasks with up to 12% improvements.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ClusterViG: Efficient Globally Aware Vision GNNs via Image Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10640v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have dominated the field of Computer Vision (CV). Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | IEEE MCNA 2025 | None |
| **[Context Aware Grounded Teacher for Source Free Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15404v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We focus on the Source Free Object Detection (SFOD) problem, when source data is unavailable during adaptation, and the model must adapt to the unlabeled target domain. In medical imaging, several approaches have leveraged a semi-supervised student-teacher architecture to bridge domain discrepancy. Context imbalance in labeled training data and significant domain shifts between domains can lead to biased teacher models that produce inaccurate pseudolabels, degrading the student model's performance and causing a mode collapse. Class imbalance, particularly when one class significantly outnumbers another, leads to contextual bias. To tackle the problem of context bias and the significant performance drop of the student model in the SFOD setting, we introduce Grounded Teacher (GT) as a standard framework. In this study, we model contextual relationships using a dedicated relational context module and leverage it to mitigate inherent biases in the model. This approach enables us to apply augmentations to closely related classes, across and within domains, enhancing the performance of underrepresented classes while keeping the effect on dominant classes minimal. We further improve the quality of predictions by implementing an expert foundational branch to supervise the student model. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating context bias under the SFOD setting through experiments on three medical datasets supported by comprehensive ablation studies. All relevant resources, including preprocessed data, trained model weights, and code, are publicly available at this https://github.com/Tajamul21/Grounded_Teacher.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Tajamul21/Grounded_Teacher) |

Existing detectors struggle to balance accuracy and efficiency due to rigid receptive fields and redundant architectures. To address these limitations, we propose Variable Receptive Field DETR (VRF-DETR), a transformer-based detector incorporating three key components: 1) Multi-Scale Context Fusion (MSCF) module that dynamically recalibrates features through adaptive spatial attention and gated multi-scale fusion, 2) Gated Convolution (GConv) layer enabling parameter-efficient local-context modeling via depthwise separable operations and dynamic gating, and 3) Gated Multi-scale Fusion (GMCF) Bottleneck that hierarchically disentangles occluded objects through cascaded global-local interactions. Experiments on VisDrone2019 demonstrate VRF-DETR achieves 51.4\% mAP\textsubscript{50} and 31.8\% mAP\textsubscript{50:95} with only 13.5M parameters. This work establishes a new efficiency-accuracy Pareto frontier for UAV-based detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a new You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based detection model that incorporates Pretrained Knowledge (PK), called PK-YOLO, to improve the performance for brain tumor detection in multiplane MRI slices. To our best knowledge, PK-YOLO is the first pretrained knowledge guided YOLO-based object detector. The main components of the new method are a pretrained pure lightweight convolutional neural network-based backbone via sparse masked modeling, a YOLO architecture with the pretrained backbone, and a regression loss function for improving small object detection. The pretrained backbone allows for feature transferability of object queries on individual plane MRI slices into the model encoders, and the learned domain knowledge base can improve in-domain detection. The improved loss function can further boost detection performance on small-size brain tumors in multiplanar two-dimensional MRI slices. Experimental results show that the proposed PK-YOLO achieves competitive performance on the multiplanar MRI brain tumor detection datasets compared to state-of-the-art YOLO-like and DETR-like object detectors.

These issues hinder the performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous driving.Traditional enhancement techniques, such as multi-scale fusion and histogram equalization, fail to preserve fine details and often struggle with maintaining the natural appearance of enhanced images under complex lighting conditions. Although the Retinex theory provides a foundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose the Dual Light Enhance Network (DLEN), a novel architecture that incorporates two distinct attention mechanisms, considering both spatial and frequency domains. Our model introduces a learnable wavelet transform module in the illumination estimation phase, preserving high- and low-frequency components to enhance edge and texture details. Additionally, we design a dual-branch structure that leverages the power of the Transformer architecture to enhance both the illumination and structural components of the image.Through extensive experiments, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.Code is available here: https://github.com/LaLaLoXX/DLEN</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages and 6 figures</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/LaLaLoXX/DLEN) |

This challenge resonates profoundly in the domain of geoscience and remote sensing, where high-fidelity detection of tiny objects can facilitate a myriad of applications ranging from urban planning to environmental monitoring. In this paper, we propose a new framework, namely, DeNoising FPN with Trans R-CNN (DNTR), to improve the performance of tiny object detection. DNTR consists of an easy plug-in design, DeNoising FPN (DN-FPN), and an effective Transformer-based detector, Trans R-CNN. Specifically, feature fusion in the feature pyramid network is important for detecting multiscale objects. However, noisy features may be produced during the fusion process since there is no regularization between the features of different scales. Therefore, we introduce a DN-FPN module that utilizes contrastive learning to suppress noise in each level's features in the top-down path of FPN. Second, based on the two-stage framework, we replace the obsolete R-CNN detector with a novel Trans R-CNN detector to focus on the representation of tiny objects with self-attention. Experimental results manifest that our DNTR outperforms the baselines by at least 17.4% in terms of APvt on the AI-TOD dataset and 9.6% in terms of AP on the VisDrone dataset, respectively.

However, their efficient implementation strategy has not been comprehensively studied, hence limiting SNN deployments for edge AI systems. Toward this, we propose a design methodology to enable efficient SNN processing on commodity neuromorphic processors. To do this, we first study the key characteristics of targeted neuromorphic hardware (e.g., memory and compute budgets), and leverage this information to perform compatibility analysis for network selection. Afterward, we employ a mapping strategy for efficient SNN implementation on the targeted processor. Furthermore, we incorporate an efficient on-chip learning mechanism to update the systems' knowledge for adapting to new input classes and dynamic environments. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology leads the system to achieve low latency of inference (i.e., less than 50ms for image classification, less than 200ms for real-time object detection in video streaming, and less than 1ms in keyword recognition) and low latency of on-chip learning (i.e., less than 2ms for keyword recognition), while incurring less than 250mW of processing power and less than 15mJ of energy consumption across the respective different applications and scenarios. These results show the potential of the proposed methodology in enabling efficient edge AI systems for diverse application use-cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025 in Rome, Italy</p></details> | None |
| **[Recognize Any Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01373v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the semantics of individual regions or patches of unconstrained images, such as open-world object detection, remains a critical yet challenging task in computer vision. Building on the success of powerful image-level vision-language (ViL) foundation models like CLIP, recent efforts have sought to harness their capabilities by either training a contrastive model from scratch with an extensive collection of region-label pairs or aligning the outputs of a detection model with image-level representations of region proposals. Despite notable progress, these approaches are plagued by computationally intensive training requirements, susceptibility to data noise, and deficiency in contextual information. To address these limitations, we explore the synergistic potential of off-the-shelf foundation models, leveraging their respective strengths in localization and semantics. We introduce a novel, generic, and efficient architecture, named RegionSpot, designed to integrate position-aware localization knowledge from a localization foundation model (e.g., SAM) with semantic information from a ViL model (e.g., CLIP). To fully exploit pretrained knowledge while minimizing training overhead, we keep both foundation models frozen, focusing optimization efforts solely on a lightweight attention-based knowledge integration module. Extensive experiments in open-world object recognition show that our RegionSpot achieves significant performance gain over prior alternatives, along with substantial computational savings (e.g., training our model with 3 million data in a single day using 8 V100 GPUs). RegionSpot outperforms GLIP-L by 2.9 in mAP on LVIS val set, with an even larger margin of 13.1 AP for more challenging and rare categories, and a 2.5 AP increase on ODinW. Furthermore, it exceeds GroundingDINO-L by 11.0 AP for rare categories on the LVIS minival set.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

It isn't easy to strike a balance between visual privacy and action recognition performance in most computer vision models. Is it possible to safeguard privacy without sacrificing performance? It poses a formidable challenge, as even minor privacy enhancements can lead to substantial performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving image anonymization technique that optimizes the anonymizer using penalties from the utility branch, ensuring improved action recognition performance while minimally affecting privacy leakage. This approach addresses the trade-off between minimizing privacy leakage and maintaining high action performance. The proposed approach is primarily designed to align with the regulatory standards of the EU AI Act and GDPR, ensuring the protection of personally identifiable information while maintaining action performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a feature-based penalty scheme that exclusively controls the action features, allowing freedom to anonymize private attributes. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that applying a penalty to anonymizer from utility branch enhances action performance while maintaining nearly consistent privacy leakage across different penalty settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPRW 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Visual Consensus Prompting for Co-Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14254v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing co-salient object detection (CoSOD) methods generally employ a three-stage architecture (i.e., encoding, consensus extraction & dispersion, and prediction) along with a typical full fine-tuning paradigm. Although they yield certain benefits, they exhibit two notable limitations: 1) This architecture relies on encoded features to facilitate consensus extraction, but the meticulously extracted consensus does not provide timely guidance to the encoding stage. 2) This paradigm involves globally updating all parameters of the model, which is parameter-inefficient and hinders the effective representation of knowledge within the foundation model for this task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an interaction-effective and parameter-efficient concise architecture for the CoSOD task, addressing two key limitations. It introduces, for the first time, a parameter-efficient prompt tuning paradigm and seamlessly embeds consensus into the prompts to formulate task-specific Visual Consensus Prompts (VCP). Our VCP aims to induce the frozen foundation model to perform better on CoSOD tasks by formulating task-specific visual consensus prompts with minimized tunable parameters. Concretely, the primary insight of the purposeful Consensus Prompt Generator (CPG) is to enforce limited tunable parameters to focus on co-salient representations and generate consensus prompts. The formulated Consensus Prompt Disperser (CPD) leverages consensus prompts to form task-specific visual consensus prompts, thereby arousing the powerful potential of pre-trained models in addressing CoSOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our concise VCP outperforms 13 cutting-edge full fine-tuning models, achieving the new state of the art (with 6.8% improvement in F_m metrics on the most challenging CoCA dataset).

However, the development of image analysis methods for EBCs is challenging due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of the data. This work addresses the problem of object detection for EBC cameras. The current approaches to EBC object detection focus on constructing complex data representations and rely on specialized architectures. We introduce I2EvDet (Image-to-Event Detection), a novel adaptation framework that bridges mainstream object detection with temporal event data processing. First, we demonstrate that a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer, or RT-DETR, a state-of-the-art natural image detector, trained on a simple image-like representation of the EBC data achieves performance comparable to specialized EBC methods. Next, as part of our framework, we develop an efficient adaptation technique that transforms image-based detectors into event-based detection models by modifying their frozen latent representation space through minimal architectural additions. The resulting EvRT-DETR model reaches state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark datasets Gen1 (mAP $+2.3$) and 1Mpx/Gen4 (mAP $+1.4$). These results demonstrate a fundamentally new approach to EBC object detection through principled adaptation of mainstream architectures, offering an efficient alternative with potential applications to other temporal visual domains.

So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps.

However, these methods rely heavily on data augmentation during representation learning, which can lead to suboptimal results if not implemented carefully. A common augmentation technique in contrastive learning is random cropping followed by resizing.

To tackle this issue, we introduce LeOCLR (Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations), a framework that employs a novel instance discrimination approach and an adapted loss function. This method prevents the loss of important semantic features caused by mapping different object parts during representation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that LeOCLR consistently improves representation learning across various datasets, outperforming baseline models.

However, it struggles with the extraction of multi-scale local features, leading to limited performance in detecting small targets, especially when they are densely arranged. Therefore, we propose Density-Sensitive Vision Transformer with Adaptive Tokens (DenSe-AdViT) for dense SAR target detection. We design a Density-Aware Module (DAM) as a preliminary component that generates a density tensor based on target distribution. It is guided by a meticulously crafted objective metric, enabling precise and effective capture of the spatial distribution and density of objects. To integrate the multi-scale information enhanced by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the global features derived from the Transformer, Density-Enhanced Fusion Module (DEFM) is proposed. It effectively refines attention toward target-survival regions with the assist of density mask and the multiple sources features. Notably, our DenSe-AdViT achieves 79.8% mAP on the RSDD dataset and 92.5% on the SIVED dataset, both of which feature a large number of densely distributed vehicle targets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present HD-OOD3D, a novel two-stage method for detecting unknown objects. We demonstrate the superiority of two-stage approaches over single-stage methods, achieving more robust detection of unknown objects while addressing key challenges in the evaluation protocol. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the standard evaluation protocol for OOD detection, revealing the critical impact of hyperparameter choices. To address the challenge of scaling the learning of unknown objects, we explore unsupervised training strategies to generate pseudo-labels for unknowns. Among the different approaches evaluated, our experiments show that top-5 auto-labelling offers more promising performance compared to simple resizing techniques.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mixture of Scale Experts for Alignment-free RGBT Video Object Detection and A Unified Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12143v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing RGB-Thermal Video Object Detection (RGBT VOD) methods predominantly rely on the manual alignment of image pairs, that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This dependency significantly restricts the scalability and practical applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel framework termed the Mixture of Scale Experts Network (MSENet). MSENet integrates multiple experts trained at different perceptual scales, enabling the capture of scale discrepancies between RGB and thermal image pairs without the need for explicit alignment. Specifically, to address the issue of unaligned scales, MSENet introduces a set of experts designed to perceive the correlation between RGBT image pairs across various scales. These experts are capable of identifying and quantifying the scale differences inherent in the image pairs. Subsequently, a dynamic routing mechanism is incorporated to assign adaptive weights to each expert, allowing the network to dynamically select the most appropriate experts based on the specific characteristics of the input data. Furthermore, to address the issue of weakly unaligned positions, we integrate deformable convolution into the network. Deformable convolution is employed to learn position displacements between the RGB and thermal modalities, thereby mitigating the impact of spatial misalignment. To provide a comprehensive evaluation platform for alignment-free RGBT VOD, we introduce a new benchmark dataset. This dataset includes eleven common object categories, with a total of 60,988 images and 271,835 object instances. The dataset encompasses a wide range of scenes from both daily life and natural environments, ensuring high content diversity and complexity.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces HeatMap Position Embedding (HMPE), a novel Transformer Optimization technique that enhances object detection performance by dynamically integrating positional encoding with semantic detection information through heatmap-guided adaptive learning.We also innovatively visualize the HMPE method, offering clear visualization of embedded information for parameter fine-tuning.We then create Multi-Scale ObjectBox-Heatmap Fusion Encoder (MOHFE) and HeatMap Induced High-Quality Queries for Decoder (HIDQ) modules. These are designed for the encoder and decoder, respectively, to generate high-quality queries and reduce background noise queries.Using both heatmap embedding and Linear-Snake Conv(LSConv) feature engineering, we enhance the embedding of massively diverse small object categories and reduced the decoder multihead layers, thereby accelerating both inference and training.In the generalization experiments, our approach outperforme the baseline mAP by 1.9% on the small object dataset (NWPU VHR-10) and by 1.2% on the general dataset (PASCAL VOC). By employing HMPE-enhanced embedding, we are able to reduce the number of decoder layers from eight to a minimum of three, significantly decreasing both inference and training costs.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing models often struggle with unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL (Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video. Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems.

This work aims to evaluate state-of-the-art image enhancement models, investigate their effects on underwater object detection, and explore their potential to improve detection performance. To this end, we apply nine recent underwater image enhancement models, covering physical, non-physical and learning-based categories, to two recent underwater image datasets. Following this, we conduct joint qualitative and quantitative analyses on the original and enhanced images, revealing the discrepancy between the two analyses, and analyzing changes in the quality distribution of the images after enhancement. We then train three recent object detection models on the original datasets, selecting the best-performing detector for further analysis. This detector is subsequently re-trained on the enhanced datasets to evaluate changes in detection performance, highlighting the adverse effect of enhancement on detection performance at the dataset level. Next, we perform a correlation study to examine the relationship between various enhancement metrics and the mean Average Precision (mAP). Finally, we conduct an image-level analysis that reveals images of improved detection performance after enhancement. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of image enhancement to improve detection performance and provide valuable insights for researchers to further explore the effects of enhancement on detection at the individual image level, rather than at the dataset level. This could enable the selective application of enhancement for improved detection.

This vulnerability pose significant risks in high-stakes applications such as autonomous vehicles, security surveillance, and safety-critical inspection systems. While the existing literature extensively covers adversarial attacks in image classification, comprehensive analyses of such attacks on object detection systems remain limited. This paper presents a novel taxonomic framework for categorizing adversarial attacks specific to object detection architectures, synthesizes existing robustness metrics, and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art attack methodologies on popular object detection models, including both traditional detectors and modern detectors with vision-language pretraining. Through rigorous analysis of open-source attack implementations and their effectiveness across diverse detection architectures, we derive key insights into attack characteristics. Furthermore, we delineate critical research gaps and emerging challenges to guide future investigations in securing object detection systems against adversarial threats. Our findings establish a foundation for developing more robust detection models while highlighting the urgent need for standardized evaluation protocols in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> | None |

From identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the inherent complexities of SAR data and the scarcity of annotations present significant challenges in the advancement of object detection in this domain. Notably, the detection of small objects in satellite-borne SAR images poses a particularly intricate problem, because of the technology's relatively low spatial resolution and inherent noise. Furthermore, the lack of large labelled SAR datasets hinders the development of supervised deep learning-based object detection models. In this paper, we introduce TRANSAR, a novel self-supervised end-to-end vision transformer-based SAR object detection model that incorporates masked image pre-training on an unlabeled SAR image dataset that spans more than $25,700$ km\textsuperscript{2} ground area. Unlike traditional object detection formulation, our approach capitalises on auxiliary binary semantic segmentation, designed to segregate objects of interest during the post-tuning, especially the smaller ones, from the background. In addition, to address the innate class imbalance due to the disproportion of the object to the image size, we introduce an adaptive sampling scheduler that dynamically adjusts the target class distribution during training based on curriculum learning and model feedback. This approach allows us to outperform conventional supervised architecture such as DeepLabv3 or UNet, and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based arhitectures such as DPT, SegFormer or UperNet, as shown by extensive evaluations on benchmark SAR datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 ML4RS https://ml-for-rs.github.io/iclr2025/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ml-for-rs.github.io/iclr2025) |

However, 3D object detectors are typically trained in a fully supervised way, relying extensively on 3D labeled data, which is labor-intensive and costly to annotate. This work focuses on weakly-supervised 3D detection to reduce data needs using a monocular method that leverages a singlecamera system over expensive LiDAR sensors or multi-camera setups. We propose a general model Weak Cube R-CNN, which can predict objects in 3D at inference time, requiring only 2D box annotations for training by exploiting the relationship between 2D projections of 3D cubes. Our proposed method utilizes pre-trained frozen foundation 2D models to estimate depth and orientation information on a training set. We use these estimated values as pseudo-ground truths during training. We design loss functions that avoid 3D labels by incorporating information from the external models into the loss. In this way, we aim to implicitly transfer knowledge from these large foundation 2D models without having access to 3D bounding box annotations. Experimental results on the SUN RGB-D dataset show increased performance in accuracy compared to an annotation time equalized Cube R-CNN baseline. While not precise for centimetre-level measurements, this method provides a strong foundation for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures.

A custom dataset was developed featuring both single-class (greenfruit) and multi-class (occluded and non-occluded greenfruits) annotations to assess model performance under dynamic real-world conditions. RF-DETR object detection model, utilizing a DINOv2 backbone and deformable attention, excelled in global context modeling, effectively identifying partially occluded or ambiguous greenfruits. In contrast, YOLOv12 leveraged CNN-based attention for enhanced local feature extraction, optimizing it for computational efficiency and edge deployment. RF-DETR achieved the highest mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.9464 in single-class detection, proving its superior ability to localize greenfruits in cluttered scenes. Although YOLOv12N recorded the highest mAP@50:95 of 0.7620, RF-DETR consistently outperformed in complex spatial scenarios. For multi-class detection, RF-DETR led with an mAP@50 of 0.8298, showing its capability to differentiate between occluded and non-occluded fruits, while YOLOv12L scored highest in mAP@50:95 with 0.6622, indicating better classification in detailed occlusion contexts. Training dynamics analysis highlighted RF-DETR's swift convergence, particularly in single-class settings where it plateaued within 10 epochs, demonstrating the efficiency of transformer-based architectures in adapting to dynamic visual data. These findings validate RF-DETR's effectiveness for precision agricultural applications, with YOLOv12 suited for fast-response scenarios. >Index Terms: RF-DETR object detection, YOLOv12, YOLOv13, YOLOv14, YOLOv15, YOLOE, YOLO World, YOLO, You Only Look Once, Roboflow, Detection Transformers, CNNs</p></details> |  | None |

However, the reliability of these models and consequently their safe integration onto robots remains unknown when deployed in environments unseen during training. To provide safety guarantees, we rigorously quantify the uncertainty of pre-trained perception systems for object detection and scene completion via a novel calibration technique based on conformal prediction. Crucially, this procedure guarantees robustness to distribution shifts in states when perception outputs are used in conjunction with a planner. As a result, the calibrated perception system can be used in combination with any safe planner to provide an end-to-end statistical assurance on safety in unseen environments. We evaluate the resulting approach, Perceive with Confidence (PwC), in simulation and on hardware where a quadruped robot navigates through previously unseen indoor, static environments. These experiments validate the safety assurances for obstacle avoidance provided by PwC. In simulation, our method reduces obstacle misdetection by $70\%$ compared to uncalibrated perception models. While misdetections lead to collisions for baseline methods, our approach consistently achieves $100\%$ safety. We further demonstrate reducing the conservatism of our method without sacrificing safety, achieving a $46\%$ increase in success rates in challenging environments while maintaining $100\%$ safety. In hardware experiments, our method improves empirical safety by $40\%$ over baselines and reduces obstacle misdetection by $93.3\%$. The safety gap widens to $46.7\%$ when navigation speed increases, highlighting our approach's robustness under more demanding conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos and code can be found at https://perceive-with-confidence.github.io</p></details> | None |

However, the high computational expense of existing UAV-based BSOD models limits their applicability to real-world UAV devices. To address this problem, we propose an efficient Fourier filter network with contrastive learning that achieves both real-time and accurate performance. Specifically, we first design a semantic contrastive alignment loss to align the two modalities at the semantic level, which facilitates mutual refinement in a parameter-free way. Second, inspired by the fast Fourier transform that obtains global relevance in linear complexity, we propose synchronized alignment fusion, which aligns and fuses bi-modal features in the channel and spatial dimensions by a hierarchical filtering mechanism. Our proposed model, AlignSal, reduces the number of parameters by 70.0%, decreases the floating point operations by 49.4%, and increases the inference speed by 152.5% compared to the cutting-edge BSOD model (i.e., MROS). Extensive experiments on the UAV RGB-T 2400 and seven bi-modal dense prediction datasets demonstrate that AlignSal achieves both real-time inference speed and better performance and generalizability compared to nineteen state-of-the-art models across most evaluation metrics. In addition, our ablation studies further verify AlignSal's potential in boosting the performance of existing aligned BSOD models on UAV-based unaligned data.

However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise.

This in turn has led to a lack of research into machine understanding for low-light images and (in particular) videos. A common approach is to apply annotations obtained from high quality datasets to synthetically created low light versions. In addition, these approaches are often limited through the use of unrealistic noise models. In this paper, we propose a new Degradation Estimation Network (DEN), which synthetically generates realistic standard RGB (sRGB) noise without the requirement for camera metadata. This is achieved by estimating the parameters of physics-informed noise distributions, trained in a self-supervised manner. This zero-shot approach allows our method to generate synthetic noisy content with a diverse range of realistic noise characteristics, unlike other methods which focus on recreating the noise characteristics of the training data. We evaluate our proposed synthetic pipeline using various methods trained on its synthetic data for typical low-light tasks including synthetic noise replication, video enhancement, and object detection, showing improvements of up to 24\% KLD, 21\% LPIPS, and 62\% AP$_{50-95}$, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

This challenge is particularly acute in medical applications in developing countries with limited computational resources. Combining modern and classical techniques offers a path to maintaining competitive performance while enabling practical applications. Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) methodology empowers experts to design convolutional encoders through user-drawn markers, with filters learned directly from these annotations. Recent findings demonstrate that coupling a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder creates a flyweight network suitable for SOD, requiring significantly fewer parameters than lightweight models and eliminating the need for backpropagation. Cellular Automata (CA) methods have proven successful in data-scarce scenarios but require proper initialization -- typically through user input, priors, or randomness. We propose a practical intersection of these approaches: using FLIM networks to initialize CA states with expert knowledge without requiring user interaction for each image. By decoding features from each level of a FLIM network, we can initialize multiple CAs simultaneously, creating a multi-level framework. Our method leverages the hierarchical knowledge encoded across different network layers, merging multiple saliency maps into a high-quality final output that functions as a CA ensemble. Benchmarks across two challenging medical datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our multi-level CA approach compared to established models in the deep SOD literature.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CFIS-YOLO: A Lightweight Multi-Scale Fusion Network for Edge-Deployable Wood Defect Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11305v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wood defect detection is critical for ensuring quality control in the wood processing industry. However, current industrial applications face two major challenges: traditional methods are costly, subjective, and labor-intensive, while mainstream deep learning models often struggle to balance detection accuracy and computational efficiency for edge deployment. To address these issues, this study proposes CFIS-YOLO, a lightweight object detection model optimized for edge devices. The model introduces an enhanced C2f structure, a dynamic feature recombination module, and a novel loss function that incorporates auxiliary bounding boxes and angular constraints. These innovations improve multi-scale feature fusion and small object localization while significantly reducing computational overhead. Evaluated on a public wood defect dataset, CFIS-YOLO achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 77.5\%, outperforming the baseline YOLOv10s by 4 percentage points. On SOPHON BM1684X edge devices, CFIS-YOLO delivers 135 FPS, reduces power consumption to 17.3\% of the original implementation, and incurs only a 0.5 percentage point drop in mAP. These results demonstrate that CFIS-YOLO is a practical and effective solution for real-world wood defect detection in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 11 figures | None |

Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive -- a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17fps+ for HD and 7fps+ on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds without domain-specific loss of accuracy. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200k+ annotated animal instances across 19k+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT.

Lightweight models address computational demands but typically strive in complex and scarce labeled-data scenarios. Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) learns an encoder's convolutional kernels among image patches extracted from discriminative regions marked on a few representative images, dismissing large annotated datasets, pretraining, and backpropagation. Such a methodology exploits information redundancy commonly found in biomedical image applications. This study presents methods to learn dilated-separable convolutional kernels and multi-dilation layers without backpropagation for FLIM networks. It also proposes a novel network simplification method to reduce kernel redundancy and encoder size. By combining a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder, a concept recently introduced to estimate a pointwise convolution per image, this study presents very efficient (named flyweight) SOD models for biomedical images. Experimental results in challenging datasets demonstrate superior efficiency and effectiveness to lightweight models. By requiring significantly fewer parameters and floating-point operations, the results show competitive effectiveness to heavyweight models. These advances highlight the potential of FLIM networks for data-limited and resource-constrained applications with information redundancy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[S$^2$Teacher: Step-by-step Teacher for Sparsely Annotated Oriented Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11111v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although fully-supervised oriented object detection has made significant progress in multimodal remote sensing image understanding, it comes at the cost of labor-intensive annotation. Recent studies have explored weakly and semi-supervised learning to alleviate this burden. However, these methods overlook the difficulties posed by dense annotations in complex remote sensing scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting called sparsely annotated oriented object detection (SAOOD), which only labels partial instances, and propose a solution to address its challenges. Specifically, we focus on two key issues in the setting: (1) sparse labeling leading to overfitting on limited foreground representations, and (2) unlabeled objects (false negatives) confusing feature learning. To this end, we propose the S$^2$Teacher, a novel method that progressively mines pseudo-labels for unlabeled objects, from easy to hard, to enhance foreground representations. Additionally, it reweights the loss of unlabeled objects to mitigate their impact during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$Teacher not only significantly improves detector performance across different sparse annotation levels but also achieves near-fully-supervised performance on the DOTA dataset with only 10% annotation instances, effectively balancing detection accuracy with annotation efficiency. The code will be public.</p></details> |  | None |

Applications of SNNs are currently limited to simple classification tasks because of their poor performance. In this work, we focus on bridging the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs on object detection. Our design revolves around network architecture and spiking neuron. First, the overly complex module design causes spike degradation when the YOLO series is converted to the corresponding spiking version. We design a SpikeYOLO architecture to solve this problem by simplifying the vanilla YOLO and incorporating meta SNN blocks. Second, object detection is more sensitive to quantization errors in the conversion of membrane potentials into binary spikes by spiking neurons. To address this challenge, we design a new spiking neuron that activates Integer values during training while maintaining spike-driven by extending virtual timesteps during inference. The proposed method is validated on both static and neuromorphic object detection datasets. On the static COCO dataset, we obtain 66.2% mAP@50 and 48.9% mAP@50:95, which is +15.0% and +18.7% higher than the prior state-of-the-art SNN, respectively. On the neuromorphic Gen1 dataset, we achieve 67.2% mAP@50, which is +2.5% greater than the ANN with equivalent architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by 5.7*.

This study introduces the DRone-derived Intelligence For Traffic analysis (DRIFT) dataset, a large-scale urban traffic dataset collected systematically from synchronized drone videos at approximately 250 meters altitude, covering nine interconnected intersections in Daejeon, South Korea. DRIFT provides high-resolution vehicle trajectories that include directional information, processed through video synchronization and orthomap alignment, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 81,699 vehicle trajectories. Through our DRIFT dataset, researchers can simultaneously analyze traffic at multiple scales - from individual vehicle maneuvers like lane-changes and safety metrics such as time-to-collision to aggregate network flow dynamics across interconnected urban intersections. The DRIFT dataset is structured to enable immediate use without additional preprocessing, complemented by open-source models for object detection and trajectory extraction, as well as associated analytical tools. DRIFT is expected to significantly contribute to academic research and practical applications, such as traffic flow analysis and simulation studies.

Such universality typically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure effective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents unique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets annotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical road-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current pretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road environments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D object detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel framework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection via weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing consistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model achieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an indoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization capabilities of our framework. Our results demonstrate that GATE3D significantly accelerates learning from limited annotated data through effective pre-training strategies, highlighting substantial potential for broader impacts in robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality applications.

While models such as Florence2, built on transformer architectures, have shown promise across general tasks, their performance in object detection within unstructured or cluttered environments remains underexplored. In this study, we fi-ne-tuned the Florence2 model for object detection tasks in non-constructed, complex environments. A comprehensive experimental framework was established involving multiple hardware configurations (NVIDIA T4, L4, and A100 GPUs), optimizers (AdamW, SGD), and varied hyperparameters including learning rates and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) setups. Model training and evaluation were conducted on challenging datasets representative of real-world, disordered settings. The optimized Florence2 models exhibited significant improvements in object detection accuracy, with Mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics approaching or matching those of estab-lished models such as YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. The integration of LoRA and careful fine-tuning of transformer layers contributed notably to these gains. Our find-ings highlight the adaptability of transformer-based VLMs like Florence2 for do-main-specific tasks, particularly in visually complex environments. The study under-scores the potential of fine-tuned VLMs to rival traditional convolution-based detec-tors, offering a flexible and scalable approach for advanced vision applications in re-al-world, unstructured settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> | None |

These patches were initially designed to deceive single-modal detectors (e.g., visible or infrared) and have recently been extended to target visible-infrared dual-modal detectors. However, existing dual-modal adversarial patch attacks have limited attack effectiveness across diverse physical scenarios. To address this, we propose CDUPatch, a universal cross-modal patch attack against visible-infrared object detectors across scales, views, and scenarios. Specifically, we observe that color variations lead to different levels of thermal absorption, resulting in temperature differences in infrared imaging. Leveraging this property, we propose an RGB-to-infrared adapter that maps RGB patches to infrared patches, enabling unified optimization of cross-modal patches. By learning an optimal color distribution on the adversarial patch, we can manipulate its thermal response and generate an adversarial infrared texture. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale clipping strategy and construct a new visible-infrared dataset, MSDrone, which contains aerial vehicle images in varying scales and perspectives. These data augmentation strategies enhance the robustness of our patch in real-world conditions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (e.g., DroneVehicle, LLVIP, VisDrone, MSDrone) show that our method outperforms existing patch attacks in the digital domain. Extensive physical tests further confirm strong transferability across scales, views, and scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing models predominantly rely on 2D object detection, which fails to capture the complexities of real-world violations due to: (i) an oversimplified task formulation treating violation recognition merely as object detection, (ii) inadequate validation under realistic conditions, (iii) absence of standardized baselines, and (iv) limited scalability from the unavailability of synthetic dataset generators for diverse construction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce Safe-Construct, the first framework that reformulates violation recognition as a 3D multi-view engagement task, leveraging scene-level worker-object context and 3D spatial understanding. We also propose the Synthetic Indoor Construction Site Generator (SICSG) to create diverse, scalable training data, overcoming data limitations. Safe-Construct achieves a 7.6% improvement over state-of-the-art methods across four violation types. We rigorously evaluate our approach in near-realistic settings, incorporating four violations, four workers, 14 objects, and challenging conditions like occlusions (worker-object, worker-worker) and variable illumination (back-lighting, overexposure, sunlight). By integrating 3D multi-view spatial understanding and synthetic data generation, Safe-Construct sets a new benchmark for scalable and robust safety monitoring in high-risk industries.

In this work, we investigate three novel approaches to enhance RT-DETR robustness in foggy environments: (1) Domain Adaptation via Perceptual Loss, which distills domain-invariant features from a teacher network to a student using perceptual supervision; (2) Weather Adaptive Attention, which augments the attention mechanism with fog-sensitive scaling by introducing an auxiliary foggy image stream; and (3) Weather Fusion Encoder, which integrates a dual-stream encoder architecture that fuses clear and foggy image features via multi-head self and cross-attention. Despite the architectural innovations, none of the proposed methods consistently outperform the baseline RT-DETR.

Traditionally, human inspection has been used for detection, a slow and labour-intensive process. Recent research has applied machine learning techniques to this problem, yet there remains a shortage of high-quality, publicly available datasets. This paper introduces a synthetic dataset, SimGas, featuring diverse backgrounds, interfering foreground objects, diverse leak locations, and precise segmentation ground truth. We propose a zero-shot method that combines background subtraction, zero-shot object detection, filtering, and segmentation to leverage this dataset. Experimental results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods based solely on background subtraction and zero-shot object detection with segmentation, reaching an IoU of 69%. We also present an analysis of various prompt configurations and threshold settings to provide deeper insights into the performance of our method. Finally, we qualitatively (because of the lack of ground truth) tested our performance on GasVid and reached decent results on the real-world dataset.

In this paper we introduce Ablated Learned Temperature Energy (or "AbeT" for short), an OOD detection method which lowers the False Positive Rate at 95\% True Positive Rate (FPR@95) by $43.43\%$ in classification compared to state of the art without training networks in multiple stages or requiring hyperparameters or test-time backward passes. We additionally provide empirical insights as to why our model learns to distinguish between In-Distribution (ID) and OOD samples while only being explicitly trained on ID samples via exposure to misclassified ID examples at training time. Lastly, we show the efficacy of our method in identifying predicted bounding boxes and pixels corresponding to OOD objects in object detection and semantic segmentation, respectively -- with an AUROC increase of $5.15\%$ in object detection and both a decrease in FPR@95 of $41.48\%$ and an increase in AUPRC of $34.20\%$ in semantic segmentation compared to previous state of the art.</p></details> |  | None |

Current deep learning-based MOD methods rely on probability density estimation, which restricts flexible information interaction between objects and across temporal frames. To flexibly capture high-order inter-object and temporal relationships, we propose a point-based MOD in remote sensing. Inspired by diffusion models, the network optimization is formulated as a progressive denoising process that iteratively recovers moving object centers from sparse noisy points. Specifically, we sample scattered features from the backbone outputs as atomic units for subsequent processing, while global feature embeddings are aggregated to compensate for the limited coverage of sparse point features. By modeling spatial relative positions and semantic affinities, Spatial Relation Aggregation Attention is designed to enable high-order interactions among point-level features for enhanced object representation. To enhance temporal consistency, the Temporal Propagation and Global Fusion module is designed, which leverages an implicit memory reasoning mechanism for robust cross-frame feature integration. To align with the progressive denoising process, we propose a progressive MinK optimal transport assignment strategy that establishes specialized learning objectives at each denoising level. Additionally, we introduce a missing loss function to counteract the clustering tendency of denoised points around salient objects. Experiments on the RsData remote sensing MOD dataset show that our MOD method based on scattered point denoising can more effectively explore potential relationships between sparse moving objects and improve the detection capability and temporal consistency.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures | None |

While existing PTMIOD methods demonstrate strong performance on in-domain tasks aligned with pretraining data, their plasticity to cross-domain scenarios remains underexplored. Through systematic component-wise analysis of pretrained detectors, we reveal a fundamental discrepancy: the localization modules demonstrate inherent cross-domain stability-preserving precise bounding box estimation across distribution shifts-while the classification components require enhanced plasticity to mitigate discriminability degradation in cross-domain scenarios. Motivated by these findings, we propose a dual-path framework built upon pretrained DETR-based detectors which decouples localization stability and classification plasticity: the localization path maintains stability to preserve pretrained localization knowledge, while the classification path facilitates plasticity via parameter-efficient fine-tuning and resists forgetting with pseudo-feature replay. Extensive evaluations on both in-domain (MS COCO and PASCAL VOC) and cross-domain (TT100K) benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating our method's ability to effectively balance stability and plasticity in PTMIOD, achieving robust cross-domain adaptation and strong retention of anti-forgetting capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Consequently, the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capability of object detectors has garnered increasing attention from researchers. Despite this growing interest, there remains a lack of a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and evaluation benchmark with fine-grained annotations tailored to assess the OOD generalization on more intricate tasks like object detection and grounding. To address this gap, we introduce COUNTS, a large-scale OOD dataset with object-level annotations. COUNTS encompasses 14 natural distributional shifts, over 222K samples, and more than 1,196K labeled bounding boxes. Leveraging COUNTS, we introduce two novel benchmarks: O(OD)2 and OODG. O(OD)2 is designed to comprehensively evaluate the OOD generalization capabilities of object detectors by utilizing controlled distribution shifts between training and testing data. OODG, on the other hand, aims to assess the OOD generalization of grounding abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our findings reveal that, while large models and extensive pre-training data substantially en hance performance in in-distribution (IID) scenarios, significant limitations and opportunities for improvement persist in OOD contexts for both object detectors and MLLMs. In visual grounding tasks, even the advanced GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 only achieve 56.7% and 28.0% accuracy, respectively. We hope COUNTS facilitates advancements in the development and assessment of robust object detectors and MLLMs capable of maintaining high performance under distributional shifts.</p></details> |  | None |

We demonstrate how these levels can be integrated into self-supervised pre-training for various backbones to enhance the downstream 3D detection task. We show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on three commonly-used 3D detection datasets.</p></details> | CVPRW 2025 | None |

To address these problems, we propose two new strategies, density-guided anchors (DGA) and density-guided NMS (DG-NMS), which uses object density maps to jointly compute optimal anchor assignments and reweighing, as well as an adaptive NMS. Concretely, based on an unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) problem, the density owned by each ground-truth object is transported to each anchor position at a minimal transport cost. And density on anchors comprises an instance-specific density distribution, from which DGA decodes the optimal anchor assignment and re-weighting strategy. Meanwhile, DG-NMS utilizes the predicted density map to adaptively adjust the NMS threshold to reduce mistaken suppressions. In the UOT, a novel overlap-aware transport cost is specifically designed for ambiguous anchors caused by overlapped neighboring objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging CrowdHuman dataset with Citypersons dataset demonstrate that our proposed density-guided detector is effective and robust to crowdedness. The code and pre-trained models will be made available later.</p></details> |  | None |

However, salient regions predicted by existing methods usually contain unsaturated regions and shadows, which limits the model for reliable fine-grained predictions. To address this, we introduce the uncertainty guidance learning approach to SOD, intended to enhance the model's perception of uncertain regions. Specifically, we design a novel Uncertainty Guided Refinement Attention Network (UGRAN), which incorporates three important components, i.e., the Multilevel Interaction Attention (MIA) module, the Scale Spatial-Consistent Attention (SSCA) module, and the Uncertainty Refinement Attention (URA) module. Unlike conventional methods dedicated to enhancing features, the proposed MIA facilitates the interaction and perception of multilevel features, leveraging the complementary characteristics among multilevel features. Then, through the proposed SSCA, the salient information across diverse scales within the aggregated features can be integrated more comprehensively and integrally. In the subsequent steps, we utilize the uncertainty map generated from the saliency prediction map to enhance the model's perception capability of uncertain regions, generating a highly-saturated fine-grained saliency prediction map. Additionally, we devise an adaptive dynamic partition (ADP) mechanism to minimize the computational overhead of the URA module and improve the utilization of uncertainty guidance. Experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed UGRAN over the state-of-the-art methodologies.

| **[Pillar-Voxel Fusion Network for 3D Object Detection in Airborne Hyperspectral Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09506v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral point clouds (HPCs) can simultaneously characterize 3D spatial and spectral information of ground objects, offering excellent 3D perception and target recognition capabilities. Current approaches for generating HPCs often involve fusion techniques with hyperspectral images and LiDAR point clouds, which inevitably lead to geometric-spectral distortions due to fusion errors and obstacle occlusions. These adverse effects limit their performance in downstream fine-grained tasks across multiple scenarios, particularly in airborne applications. To address these issues, we propose PiV-AHPC, a 3D object detection network for airborne HPCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at this HPCs task. Specifically, we first develop a pillar-voxel dual-branch encoder, where the former captures spectral and vertical structural features from HPCs to overcome spectral distortion, while the latter emphasizes extracting accurate 3D spatial features from point clouds. A multi-level feature fusion mechanism is devised to enhance information interaction between the two branches, achieving neighborhood feature alignment and channel-adaptive selection, thereby organically integrating heterogeneous features and mitigating geometric distortion. Extensive experiments on two airborne HPCs datasets demonstrate that PiV-AHPC possesses state-of-the-art detection performance and high generalization capability.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite they have shown promise on OV-related tasks, their effectiveness in conventional vision tasks has thus far been unevaluated. In this work, we present the systematic review of VLM-based detection and segmentation, view VLM as the foundational model and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple downstream tasks for the first time: 1) The evaluation spans eight detection scenarios (closed-set detection, domain adaptation, crowded objects, etc.) and eight segmentation scenarios (few-shot, open-world, small object, etc.), revealing distinct performance advantages and limitations of various VLM architectures across tasks. 2) As for detection tasks, we evaluate VLMs under three finetuning granularities: \textit{zero prediction}, \textit{visual fine-tuning}, and \textit{text prompt}, and further analyze how different finetuning strategies impact performance under varied task. 3) Based on empirical findings, we provide in-depth analysis of the correlations between task characteristics, model architectures, and training methodologies, offering insights for future VLM design. 4) We believe that this work shall be valuable to the pattern recognition experts working in the fields of computer vision, multimodal learning, and vision foundation models by introducing them to the problem, and familiarizing them with the current status of the progress while providing promising directions for future research.

Real-world testing environments often involve a combination of both covariate and semantic shifts. While numerous methods have been proposed to address these critical issues, only a few works tackled them simultaneously. Moreover, prior works often improve one problem but sacrifice the other. To overcome these limitations, we delve into boosting OoD detection and OoD generalization from the perspective of information theory, which can be easily applied to existing models and different tasks. Building upon the theoretical bounds for mutual information and conditional entropy, we provide a unified approach, composed of Mutual Information Minimization (MI-Min) and Conditional Entropy Maximizing (CE-Max). Extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations on multi-label image classification and object detection have demonstrated the superiority of our method. It successfully mitigates trade-offs between the two challenges compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> | Under Review | None |
| **[End-to-end Open-vocabulary Video Visual Relationship Detection using Multi-modal Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12499v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary video visual relationship detection aims to expand video visual relationship detection beyond annotated categories by detecting unseen relationships between both seen and unseen objects in videos. Existing methods usually use trajectory detectors trained on closed datasets to detect object trajectories, and then feed these trajectories into large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to achieve open-vocabulary classification. Such heavy dependence on the pre-trained trajectory detectors limits their ability to generalize to novel object categories, leading to performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose to unify object trajectory detection and relationship classification into an end-to-end open-vocabulary framework. Under this framework, we propose a relationship-aware open-vocabulary trajectory detector. It primarily consists of a query-based Transformer decoder, where the visual encoder of CLIP is distilled for frame-wise open-vocabulary object detection, and a trajectory associator. To exploit relationship context during trajectory detection, a relationship query is embedded into the Transformer decoder, and accordingly, an auxiliary relationship loss is designed to enable the decoder to perceive the relationships between objects explicitly. Moreover, we propose an open-vocabulary relationship classifier that leverages the rich semantic knowledge of CLIP to discover novel relationships. To adapt CLIP well to relationship classification, we design a multi-modal prompting method that employs spatio-temporal visual prompting for visual representation and vision-guided language prompting for language input. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, VidVRD and VidOR, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our framework is also applied to a more difficult cross-dataset scenario to further demonstrate its generalization ability.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI | None |

Previous image classification methods primarily modify model architectures or add features, and they optimize models using cross-entropy loss on class logits. Since they focus on classifying images with considering class labels, these methods may struggle to learn various \emph{aspects} of classes (e.g., natural positions and shape changes). Rethinking the previous approach from a novel view, we propose a multi-aspect knowledge distillation method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach involves: 1) querying Large Language Model with multi-aspect questions relevant to the knowledge we want to transfer to the model, 2) extracting corresponding logits from MLLM, and 3) expanding the model's output dimensions to distill these multi-aspect logits. We then apply cross-entropy loss to class logits and binary cross-entropy loss to multi-aspect logits. Through our method, the model can learn not only the knowledge about visual aspects but also the abstract and complex aspects that require a deeper understanding. We primarily apply our method to image classification, and to explore the potential for extending our model, such as object detection. In all experimental results, our method improves the performance of the baselines. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multi-aspect knowledge distillation. These results demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge about various aspects to the model and the aspect knowledge can enhance model performance in computer vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to CVPRW2025 (FGVC12)</p></details> | None |

However, existing research often overlooks data collection strategies and evaluation metrics tailored to real-world scenarios involving neural networks. In this study, we systematically investigate data collection and augmentation techniques focused on object occlusion, aiming to mimic occlusion relationships observed in practical applications. Surprisingly, we find that even a simple occlusion mechanism is sufficient to achieve strong performance when introducing new object categories. Notably, by adding just 15 images of a new category to a large-scale training dataset containing over half a million images across hundreds of categories, the model achieves 95\% accuracy on an unseen test set with thousands of instances of the new category.</p></details> |  | None |

This results in a complex distribution of radar hits that depends on factors including object category, size, and orientation. Current radar-camera fusion methods implicitly account for this with a black-box neural network. In this paper, we explicitly utilize a radar hit distribution model to assist fusion. First, we build a model to predict radar hit distributions conditioned on object properties obtained from a monocular detector. Second, we use the predicted distribution as a kernel to match actual measured radar points in the neighborhood of the monocular detections, generating matching scores at nearby positions. Finally, a fusion stage combines context with the kernel detector to refine the matching scores. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art radar-camera detection performance on nuScenes.

A systematic study of this problem is essential for many safety-critical robotic applications that rely on the measurements from learned perception modules. We consider a (small) team of quadrotor robots that rely only on an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the visual data measurements obtained from a learned multi-task perception module (e.g., object detection) for downstream tasks, including relative localization and coordination. We focus on a class of adversarial perception attacks that cause misclassification, mislocalization, and latency. We propose that the effects of adversarial misclassification and mislocalization can be modeled as sporadic (intermittent) and spurious measurement data for the downstream tasks. To address this, we present a framework for resilience analysis of multi-robot coordination with adversarial measurements. The framework integrates data from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the learned perception model for robust relative localization and state estimation in the presence of adversarially sporadic and spurious measurements. The framework allows for quantifying the degradation in system observability and stability in relation to the success rate of adversarial perception. Finally, experimental results on a multi-robot platform demonstrate the real-world applicability of our methodology for resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at the 2025 Int'l Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</p></details> | None |
| **[High Dynamic Range Modulo Imaging for Robust Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11472v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection precision is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficacy of autonomous driving systems. The quality of acquired images directly influences the ability of autonomous driving systems to correctly recognize and respond to other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles in real-time. However, real environments present extreme variations in lighting, causing saturation problems and resulting in the loss of crucial details for detection. Traditionally, High Dynamic Range (HDR) images have been preferred for their ability to capture a broad spectrum of light intensities, but the need for multiple captures to construct HDR images is inefficient for real-time applications in autonomous vehicles. To address these issues, this work introduces the use of modulo sensors for robust object detection. The modulo sensor allows pixels to `reset/wrap' upon reaching saturation level by acquiring an irradiance encoding image which can then be recovered using unwrapping algorithms. The applied reconstruction techniques enable HDR recovery of color intensity and image details, ensuring better visual quality even under extreme lighting conditions at the cost of extra time. Experiments with the YOLOv10 model demonstrate that images processed using modulo images achieve performance comparable to HDR images and significantly surpass saturated images in terms of object detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed modulo imaging step combined with HDR image reconstruction is shorter than the time required for conventional HDR image acquisition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SO-DETR: Leveraging Dual-Domain Features and Knowledge Distillation for Small Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11470v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detection Transformer-based methods have achieved significant advancements in general object detection. However, challenges remain in effectively detecting small objects. One key difficulty is that existing encoders struggle to efficiently fuse low-level features. Additionally, the query selection strategies are not effectively tailored for small objects. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient model, Small Object Detection Transformer (SO-DETR). The model comprises three key components: a dual-domain hybrid encoder, an enhanced query selection mechanism, and a knowledge distillation strategy. The dual-domain hybrid encoder integrates spatial and frequency domains to fuse multi-scale features effectively. This approach enhances the representation of high-resolution features while maintaining relatively low computational overhead. The enhanced query selection mechanism optimizes query initialization by dynamically selecting high-scoring anchor boxes using expanded IoU, thereby improving the allocation of query resources. Furthermore, by incorporating a lightweight backbone network and implementing a knowledge distillation strategy, we develop an efficient detector for small objects. Experimental results on the VisDrone-2019-DET and UAVVaste datasets demonstrate that SO-DETR outperforms existing methods with similar computational demands.

While traditionally e-government studies were focusing on text-based interactions, this one explores the innovative application of ML for image analysis, an approach that enables governments to address citizen petitions more efficiently. By using image classification and object detection algorithms, the model proposed in this article supports public institutions in identifying and fast responding to evidence submitted by citizens in picture format, such as infrastructure issues, environmental concerns or other urban issues that citizens might face. The research also highlights the Jevons Paradox as a critical factor, wherein increased efficiency from the citizen side (especially using mobile platforms and apps) may generate higher demand which should lead to scalable and robust solutions. Using as a case study a Romanian municipality who provided datasets of citizen-submitted images, the author analysed and proved that ML can improve accuracy and responsiveness of public institutions. The findings suggest that adopting ML for e-petition systems can not only enhance citizen participation but also speeding up administrative processes, paving the way for more transparent and effective governance. This study contributes to the discourse on e-government 3.0 by showing the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform public service delivery, ensuring sustainable (and scalable) solutions for the growing demands of modern urban governance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures | None |

Yet, the domain of autonomous racing is often characterized by scaled, computationally limited robots used for cost-effectiveness and safety. For this reason, opponent detection and tracking systems typically resort to traditional computer vision techniques due to computational constraints. This paper introduces TinyCenterSpeed, a streamlined adaptation of the seminal CenterPoint method, optimized for real-time performance on 1:10 scale autonomous racing platforms. This adaptation is viable even on OBCs powered solely by Central Processing Units (CPUs), as it incorporates the use of an external Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). We demonstrate that, compared to Adaptive Breakpoint Detector (ABD), the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) in scaled autonomous racing, TinyCenterSpeed not only improves detection and velocity estimation by up to 61.38% but also supports multi-opponent detection and estimation. It achieves real-time performance with an inference time of just 7.88 ms on the TPU, significantly reducing CPU utilization 8.3-fold.</p></details> |  | None |

However, even recent T2V models find it challenging to follow text descriptions accurately, especially when the prompt requires accurate control of spatial layouts or object trajectories. A recent line of research uses layout guidance for T2V models that require fine-tuning or iterative manipulation of the attention map during inference time. This significantly increases the memory requirement, making it difficult to adopt a large T2V model as a backbone. To address this, we introduce Video-MSG, a training-free Guidance method for T2V generation based on Multimodal planning and Structured noise initialization. Video-MSG consists of three steps, where in the first two steps, Video-MSG creates Video Sketch, a fine-grained spatio-temporal plan for the final video, specifying background, foreground, and object trajectories, in the form of draft video frames. In the last step, Video-MSG guides a downstream T2V diffusion model with Video Sketch through noise inversion and denoising. Notably, Video-MSG does not need fine-tuning or attention manipulation with additional memory during inference time, making it easier to adopt large T2V models. Video-MSG demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing text alignment with multiple T2V backbones (VideoCrafter2 and CogVideoX-5B) on popular T2V generation benchmarks (T2VCompBench and VBench). We provide comprehensive ablation studies about noise inversion ratio, different background generators, background object detection, and foreground object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://video-msg.github.io; The first three authors contributed equally</p></details> | None |

As object detectors become more robust with models like YOLOv8, developing effective adversarial methodologies is increasingly challenging. We present Truck Adversarial Camouflage Optimization (TACO), a novel framework that generates adversarial camouflage patterns on 3D vehicle models to deceive state-of-the-art object detectors. Adopting Unreal Engine 5, TACO integrates differentiable rendering with a Photorealistic Rendering Network to optimize adversarial textures targeted at YOLOv8. To ensure the generated textures are both effective in deceiving detectors and visually plausible, we introduce the Convolutional Smooth Loss function, a generalized smooth loss function. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that TACO significantly degrades YOLOv8's detection performance, achieving an AP@0.5 of 0.0099 on unseen test data. Furthermore, these adversarial patterns exhibit strong transferability to other object detection models such as Faster R-CNN and earlier YOLO versions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version matches the final published version in Big Data and Cognitive Computing (MDPI).

Specifically, our approach, namely NCLR, focuses on 2D-3D neural calibration, a novel pretext task that estimates the rigid pose aligning camera and LiDAR coordinate systems. First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching. Second, we identify the overlapping area between the image and point cloud with the fused features. Third, we establish dense 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the rigid pose. The framework not only learns fine-grained matching from points to pixels but also achieves alignment of the image and point cloud at a holistic level, understanding their relative pose. We demonstrate the efficacy of NCLR by applying the pre-trained backbone to downstream tasks, such as LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets illustrate the superiority of NCLR over existing self-supervised methods. The results confirm that joint learning from different modalities significantly enhances the network's understanding abilities and effectiveness of learned representation.

However, sensors mounted to the AVs often encounter blind spots due to obstructions from other vehicles, infrastructure, or objects in the surrounding area. While recent advancements in planning and control algorithms help AVs react to sudden object appearances from blind spots at low speeds and less complex scenarios, challenges remain at high speeds and complex intersections. Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) technology promises to enhance scene representation for AVs in complex intersections, providing sufficient time and distance to react to adversary vehicles violating traffic rules. Most existing methods for infrastructure-based vehicle detection and tracking rely on LIDAR, RADAR or sensor fusion methods, such as LIDAR-Camera and RADAR-Camera. Although LIDAR and RADAR provide accurate spatial information, the sparsity of point cloud data limits its ability to capture detailed object contours of objects far away, resulting in inaccurate 3D object detection results. Furthermore, the absence of LIDAR or RADAR at every intersection increases the cost of implementing V2I technology. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a V2I framework that utilizes monocular traffic cameras at road intersections to detect 3D objects. The results from the roadside unit (RSU) are then combined with the on-board system using an asynchronous late fusion method to enhance scene representation. Additionally, the proposed framework provides a time delay compensation module to compensate for the processing and transmission delay from the RSU. Lastly, the V2I framework is tested by simulating and validating a scenario similar to the one described in an industry report by Waymo. The results show that the proposed method improves the scene representation and the AV's perception range, giving enough time and space to react to adversary vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, This paper is under review of SAE Journal of Connected and Automated Vehicles</p></details> | None |

The brick kiln sector significantly contributes to economic development but also accounts for 8-14\% of air pollution in India. Policymakers have implemented compliance measures to regulate brick kilns. Emission inventories are critical for air quality modeling and source apportionment studies. However, the largely unorganized nature of the brick kiln sector necessitates labor-intensive survey efforts for monitoring. Recent efforts by air quality researchers have relied on manual annotation of brick kilns using satellite imagery to build emission inventories, but this approach lacks scalability. Machine-learning-based object detection methods have shown promise for detecting brick kilns; however, previous studies often rely on costly high-resolution imagery and fail to integrate with governmental policies. In this work, we developed a scalable machine-learning pipeline that detected and classified 30638 brick kilns across five states in the Indo-Gangetic Plain using free, moderate-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Our detections have a high correlation with on-ground surveys. We performed automated compliance analysis based on government policies. In the Delhi airshed, stricter policy enforcement has led to the adoption of efficient brick kiln technologies. This study highlights the need for inclusive policies that balance environmental sustainability with the livelihoods of workers.</p></details> |  | None |

In AlertTrap, implementation of Single-Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) architecture with different state-of-the-art backbone feature extractors such as MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 appears to be potential solutions for the real-time detection problem. SSD-MobileNetV1 and SSD-MobileNetV2 perform well and result in AP at 0.5 of 0.957 and 1.0, respectively. You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4-tiny outperforms the SSD family with 1.0 in AP at 0.5; however, its throughput velocity is considerably slower, which shows SSD models are better candidates for real-time implementation. We also tested the models with synthetic test sets simulating expected environmental disturbances. The YOLOv4-tiny had better tolerance to these disturbances than the SSD models. The Raspberry Pi system successfully gathered environmental data and pest counts, sending them via email over 4 G. However, running the full YOLO version in real time on Raspberry Pi is not feasible, indicating the need for a lighter object detection algorithm for future research. Among model candidates, YOLOv4-tiny generally performs best, with SSD-MobileNetV2 also comparable and sometimes better, especially in scenarios with synthetic disturbances. SSD models excel in processing time, enabling real-time, high-accuracy detection.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce DetAny3D, a promptable 3D detection foundation model capable of detecting any novel object under arbitrary camera configurations using only monocular inputs. Training a foundation model for 3D detection is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of annotated 3D data, which motivates DetAny3D to leverage the rich prior knowledge embedded in extensively pre-trained 2D foundation models to compensate for this scarcity. To effectively transfer 2D knowledge to 3D, DetAny3D incorporates two core modules: the 2D Aggregator, which aligns features from different 2D foundation models, and the 3D Interpreter with Zero-Embedding Mapping, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting in 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Experimental results validate the strong generalization of our DetAny3D, which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen categories and novel camera configurations, but also surpasses most competitors on in-domain data.DetAny3D sheds light on the potential of the 3D foundation model for diverse applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., rare object detection in autonomous driving, and demonstrates promise for further exploration of 3D-centric tasks in open-world settings.

| **[Pychop: Emulating Low-Precision Arithmetic in Numerical Methods and Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07835v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows.

| **[P2Object: Single Point Supervised Object Detection and Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07813v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object recognition using single-point supervision has attracted increasing attention recently. However, the performance gap compared with fully-supervised algorithms remains large. Previous works generated class-agnostic \textbf{\textit{proposals in an image}} offline and then treated mixed candidates as a single bag, putting a huge burden on multiple instance learning (MIL). In this paper, we introduce Point-to-Box Network (P2BNet), which constructs balanced \textbf{\textit{instance-level proposal bags}} by generating proposals in an anchor-like way and refining the proposals in a coarse-to-fine paradigm. Through further research, we find that the bag of proposals, either at the image level or the instance level, is established on discrete box sampling. This leads the pseudo box estimation into a sub-optimal solution, resulting in the truncation of object boundaries or the excessive inclusion of background. Hence, we conduct a series exploration of discrete-to-continuous optimization, yielding P2BNet++ and Point-to-Mask Network (P2MNet). P2BNet++ conducts an approximately continuous proposal sampling strategy by better utilizing spatial clues. P2MNet further introduces low-level image information to assist in pixel prediction, and a boundary self-prediction is designed to relieve the limitation of the estimated boxes. Benefiting from the continuous object-aware \textbf{\textit{pixel-level perception}}, P2MNet can generate more precise bounding boxes and generalize to segmentation tasks. Our method largely surpasses the previous methods in terms of the mean average precision on COCO, VOC, SBD, and Cityscapes, demonstrating great potential to bridge the performance gap compared with fully supervised tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV | None |
| **[Nonlocal Retinex-Based Variational Model and its Deep Unfolding Twin for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07810v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images captured under low-light conditions present significant limitations in many applications, as poor lighting can obscure details, reduce contrast, and hide noise. Removing the illumination effects and enhancing the quality of such images is crucial for many tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection. In this paper, we propose a variational method for low-light image enhancement based on the Retinex decomposition into illumination, reflectance, and noise components. A color correction pre-processing step is applied to the low-light image, which is then used as the observed input in the decomposition. Moreover, our model integrates a novel nonlocal gradient-type fidelity term designed to preserve structural details. Additionally, we propose an automatic gamma correction module. Building on the proposed variational approach, we extend the model by introducing its deep unfolding counterpart, in which the proximal operators are replaced with learnable networks. We propose cross-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in both the nonlocal prior of the reflectance and the nonlocal gradient-based constraint. Experimental results demonstrate that both methods compare favorably with several recent and state-of-the-art techniques across different datasets. In particular, despite not relying on learning strategies, the variational model outperforms most deep learning approaches both visually and in terms of quality metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Detection of Fast Moving Celestial Objects Using a Mixture of Experts and Physical-Inspired Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07777v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast moving celestial objects are characterized by velocities across the celestial sphere that significantly differ from the motions of background stars. In observational images, these objects exhibit distinct shapes, contrasting with the typical appearances of stars. Depending on the observational method employed, these celestial entities may be designated as near-Earth objects or asteroids. Historically, fast moving celestial objects have been observed using ground-based telescopes, where the relative stability of stars and Earth facilitated effective image differencing techniques alongside traditional fast moving celestial object detection and classification algorithms. However, the growing prevalence of space-based telescopes, along with their diverse observational modes, produces images with different properties, rendering conventional methods less effective. This paper presents a novel algorithm for detecting fast moving celestial objects within star fields. Our approach enhances state-of-the-art fast moving celestial object detection neural networks by transforming them into physical-inspired neural networks. These neural networks leverage the point spread function of the telescope and the specific observational mode as prior information; they can directly identify moving fast moving celestial objects within star fields without requiring additional training, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional techniques. Additionally, all neural networks are integrated using the mixture of experts technique, forming a comprehensive fast moving celestial object detection algorithm. We have evaluated our algorithm using simulated observational data that mimics various observations carried out by space based telescope scenarios and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our method effectively detects fast moving celestial objects across different observational modes.</p></details> | Accepted by the AJ | None |
| **[OoDIS: Anomaly Instance Segmentation and Detection Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11835v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe navigation of self-driving cars and robots requires a precise understanding of their environment. Training data for perception systems cannot cover the wide variety of objects that may appear during deployment. Thus, reliable identification of unknown objects, such as wild animals and untypical obstacles, is critical due to their potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been facilitated by the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. However, a comprehensive understanding of scene dynamics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Development in this area has been lagging, largely due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks. The situation is similar in object detection. While there is interest in detecting and potentially tracking every anomalous object, the availability of dedicated benchmarks is clearly limited. To address this gap, this work extends some commonly used anomaly segmentation benchmarks to include the instance segmentation and object detection tasks. Our evaluation of anomaly instance segmentation and object detection methods shows that both of these challenges remain unsolved problems.

| **[VLM-R1: A Stable and Generalizable R1-style Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07615v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently DeepSeek R1 has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a simple yet effective design. The core of R1 lies in its rule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic ground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the visual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding tasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This property makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style reinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a dedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on general vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the feasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that the RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual understanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies that uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward hacking in object detection, the emergence of the "OD aha moment", the impact of training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model sizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how reinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and we hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued progress in the vision-language RL community.

| **[RASMD: RGB And SWIR Multispectral Driving Dataset for Robust Perception in Adverse Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07603v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autonomous driving algorithms heavily rely on the visible spectrum, which is prone to performance degradation in adverse conditions like fog, rain, snow, glare, and high contrast. Although other spectral bands like near-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) can enhance vision perception in such situations, they have limitations and lack large-scale datasets and benchmarks. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging offers several advantages over NIR and LWIR. However, no publicly available large-scale datasets currently incorporate SWIR data for autonomous driving. To address this gap, we introduce the RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving (RASMD) dataset, which comprises 100,000 synchronized and spatially aligned RGB-SWIR image pairs collected across diverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. In addition, we provide a subset for RGB-SWIR translation and object detection annotations for a subset of challenging traffic scenarios to demonstrate the utility of SWIR imaging through experiments on both object detection and RGB-to-SWIR image translation. Our experiments show that combining RGB and SWIR data in an ensemble framework significantly improves detection accuracy compared to RGB-only approaches, particularly in conditions where visible-spectrum sensors struggle. We anticipate that the RASMD dataset will advance research in multispectral imaging for autonomous driving and robust perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WS-DETR: Robust Water Surface Object Detection through Vision-Radar Fusion with Detection Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07441v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust object detection for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) in complex water environments is essential for reliable navigation and operation. Specifically, water surface object detection faces challenges from blurred edges and diverse object scales. Although vision-radar fusion offers a feasible solution, existing approaches suffer from cross-modal feature conflicts, which negatively affect model robustness. To address this problem, we propose a robust vision-radar fusion model WS-DETR. In particular, we first introduce a Multi-Scale Edge Information Integration (MSEII) module to enhance edge perception and a Hierarchical Feature Aggregator (HiFA) to boost multi-scale object detection in the encoder. Then, we adopt self-moving point representations for continuous convolution and residual connection to efficiently extract irregular features under the scenarios of irregular point cloud data. To further mitigate cross-modal conflicts, an Adaptive Feature Interactive Fusion (AFIF) module is introduced to integrate visual and radar features through geometric alignment and semantic fusion. Extensive experiments on the WaterScenes dataset demonstrate that WS-DETR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, maintaining its superiority even under adverse weather and lighting conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SuperQ-GRASP: Superquadrics-based Grasp Pose Estimation on Larger Objects for Mobile-Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04386v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grasp planning and estimation have been a longstanding research problem in robotics, with two main approaches to find graspable poses on the objects: 1) geometric approach, which relies on 3D models of objects and the gripper to estimate valid grasp poses, and 2) data-driven, learning-based approach, with models trained to identify grasp poses from raw sensor observations. The latter assumes comprehensive geometric coverage during the training phase. However, the data-driven approach is typically biased toward tabletop scenarios and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios with larger objects (e.g. chair). Additionally, raw sensor data (e.g. RGB-D data) from a single view of these larger objects is often incomplete and necessitates additional observations. In this paper, we take a geometric approach, leveraging advancements in object modeling (e.g. NeRF) to build an implicit model by taking RGB images from views around the target object. This model enables the extraction of explicit mesh model while also capturing the visual appearance from novel viewpoints that is useful for perception tasks like object detection and pose estimation. We further decompose the NeRF-reconstructed 3D mesh into superquadrics (SQs) -- parametric geometric primitives, each mapped to a set of precomputed grasp poses, allowing grasp composition on the target object based on these primitives. Our proposed pipeline overcomes the problems: a) noisy depth and incomplete view of the object, with a modeling step, and b) generalization to objects of any size.

Most detectors require training images with annotated bounding boxes, which are tedious, expensive, and not always unambiguous to create. To reduce the annotation load associated with this practice, we develop POLO, a multi-class object detection model that can be trained entirely on point labels. POLO is based on simple, yet effective modifications to the YOLOv8 architecture, including alterations to the prediction process, training losses, and post-processing. We test POLO on drone recordings of waterfowl containing up to multiple thousands of individual birds in one image and compare it to a regular YOLOv8. Our experiments show that at the same annotation cost, POLO achieves improved accuracy in counting animals in aerial imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the CV4Ecology workshop at ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |

However, their effectiveness heavily depends on large amounts of annotated training data, which can be labor and time intensive. Recent advances in open-set object detection, particularly with models like Grounding-DINO, offer a potential solution to detect regions of interests based on text prompt input. Initial zero-shot experiments revealed challenges in crafting effective text prompts, especially for complex objects like individual leaves and visually similar classes. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient few-shot adaptation method that simplifies the Grounding-DINO architecture by removing the text encoder module (BERT) and introducing a randomly initialized trainable text embedding. This method achieves superior performance across multiple agricultural datasets, including plant-weed detection, plant counting, insect identification, fruit counting, and remote sensing tasks. Specifically, it demonstrates up to a $\sim24\%$ higher mAP than fully fine-tuned YOLO models on agricultural datasets and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by $\sim10\%$ in remote sensing, under few-shot learning conditions. Our method offers a promising solution for automating annotation and accelerating the development of specialized agricultural AI solutions.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Generalized Semantic Contrastive Learning via Embedding Side Information for Few-Shot Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07060v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of few-shot object detection (FSOD) is to detect novel objects with few training samples. The core challenge of this task is how to construct a generalized feature space for novel categories with limited data on the basis of the base category space, which could adapt the learned detection model to unknown scenarios. However, limited by insufficient samples for novel categories, two issues still exist: (1) the features of the novel category are easily implicitly represented by the features of the base category, leading to inseparable classifier boundaries, (2) novel categories with fewer data are not enough to fully represent the distribution, where the model fine-tuning is prone to overfitting. To address these issues, we introduce the side information to alleviate the negative influences derived from the feature space and sample viewpoints and formulate a novel generalized feature representation learning method for FSOD. Specifically, we first utilize embedding side information to construct a knowledge matrix to quantify the semantic relationship between the base and novel categories. Then, to strengthen the discrimination between semantically similar categories, we further develop contextual semantic supervised contrastive learning which embeds side information. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting problems caused by sparse samples, a side-information guided region-aware masked module is introduced to augment the diversity of samples, which finds and abandons biased information that discriminates between similar categories via counterfactual explanation, and refines the discriminative representation space further. Extensive experiments using ResNet and ViT backbones on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, LVIS V1, FSOD-1K, and FSVOD-500 benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving the ability of FSOD in most shots/splits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by T-PAMI (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence)</p></details> | None |

This was achieved by evaluating the LiDAR sensor's data through a 3D detection algorithm (PointPillars). The PointPillars algorithm incorporates a column voxel point-cloud representation and a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to generate distinctive point-cloud features representing the object to be identified, in this case, the UAV. The current localization method utilizes point-cloud segmentation, Euclidean clustering, and predefined heuristics to obtain the relative position of the UAV. Results from the two methods were then compared to a reference truth solution.</p></details> |  | None |

Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) has recently received considerable attention in AD due to its potential to enable efficient testing and validation but remains unexplored for radar point clouds. In this paper, we present NeuRadar, a NeRF-based model that jointly generates radar point clouds, camera images, and lidar point clouds. We explore set-based object detection methods such as DETR, and propose an encoder-based solution grounded in the NeRF geometry for improved generalizability. We propose both a deterministic and a probabilistic point cloud representation to accurately model the radar behavior, with the latter being able to capture radar's stochastic behavior. We achieve realistic reconstruction results for two automotive datasets, establishing a baseline for NeRF-based radar point cloud simulation models. In addition, we release radar data for ZOD's Sequences and Drives to enable further research in this field. To encourage further development of radar NeRFs, we release the source code for NeuRadar.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Efficient Roadside LiDAR Deployment: A Fast Surrogate Metric Based on Entropy-Guided Visibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06772v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of roadside LiDAR sensors plays a crucial role in the development of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). However, the high cost of LiDAR sensors necessitates efficient placement strategies to maximize detection performance. Traditional roadside LiDAR deployment methods rely on expert insight, making them time-consuming. Automating this process, however, demands extensive computation, as it requires not only visibility evaluation but also assessing detection performance across different LiDAR placements. To address this challenge, we propose a fast surrogate metric, the Entropy-Guided Visibility Score (EGVS), based on information gain to evaluate object detection performance in roadside LiDAR configurations. EGVS leverages Traffic Probabilistic Occupancy Grids (TPOG) to prioritize critical areas and employs entropy-based calculations to quantify the information captured by LiDAR beams. This eliminates the need for direct detection performance evaluation, which typically requires extensive labeling and computational resources. By integrating EGVS into the optimization process, we significantly accelerate the search for optimal LiDAR configurations. Experimental results using the AWSIM simulator demonstrate that EGVS strongly correlates with Average Precision (AP) scores and effectively predicts object detection performance. This approach offers a computationally efficient solution for roadside LiDAR deployment, facilitating scalable smart infrastructure development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, AI systems still struggle when it comes to understanding and interacting with the physical world. This reveals an important issue: relying solely on semantic-level concepts learned from internet data (e.g. texts, images) to understand the physical world is far from sufficient -- machine intelligence currently lacks an effective way to learn about the physical world. This research introduces the idea of analytic concept -- representing the concepts related to the physical world through programs of mathematical procedures, providing machine intelligence a portal to perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Except for detailing the design philosophy and providing guidelines for the application of analytic concepts, this research also introduce about the infrastructure that has been built around analytic concepts. I aim for my research to contribute to addressing these questions: What is a proper abstraction of general concepts in the physical world for machine intelligence? How to systematically integrate structured priors with neural networks to constrain AI systems to comply with physical laws?</p></details> |  | None |

To address grounding issues of such models, it has been suggested to split the pipeline into perceptional state grounding and subsequent state-based planning. As we show in this work, the state grounding ability of LMM-based approaches is still limited by weaknesses in granular, structured, domain-specific scene understanding. To address this shortcoming, we develop a more structured state grounding framework that features a domain-conditioned scene graph as its scene representation. We show that such representation is actionable in nature as it is directly mappable to a symbolic state in classical planning languages such as PDDL. We provide an instantiation of our state grounding framework where the domain-conditioned scene graph generation is implemented with a lightweight vision-language approach that classifies domain-specific predicates on top of domain-relevant object detections. Evaluated across three domains, our approach achieves significantly higher state estimation accuracy and task planning success rates compared to the previous LMM-based approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods aim to bridge this gap by aligning features across source and target domains but often fail to account for visual differences, such as color or orientation, in alignment pairs. This limitation leads to less effective domain adaptation, as the model struggles to manage both domain-specific shifts (e.g., fog) and visual variations simultaneously. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time, using a custom-built dataset, that aligning visually similar pairs significantly improves domain adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose a novel memory-based system to enhance domain alignment. This system stores precomputed features of foreground objects and background areas from the source domain, which are periodically updated during training. By retrieving visually similar source features for alignment with target foreground and background features, the model effectively addresses domain-specific differences while reducing the impact of visual variations. Extensive experiments across diverse domain shift scenarios validate our method's effectiveness, achieving 53.1 mAP on Foggy Cityscapes and 62.3 on Sim10k, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by 1.2 and 4.1 mAP, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Journal paper submission</p></details> | None |

Originally designed for large-scale models, LoRA helps mitigate overfitting, making it a promising approach for resource-constrained settings. We integrate LoRA into DiffusionDet, and evaluate its performance on the DOTA and DIOR datasets. Our results show that LoRA applied after an initial fine-tuning slightly improves performance in low-shot settings (e.g., 1-shot and 5-shot), while full fine-tuning remains more effective in higher-shot configurations. These findings highlight LoRA's potential for efficient adaptation in aerial object detection, encouraging further research into parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for few-shot learning.

We present a Transformer-based approach to learn a joint representation of video frames and past saliency information. Our model embeds long- and short-term information to detect dynamically shifting saliency in video. We provide our model with a stream of video frames and past saliency maps, which acts as a prior for the next prediction, and extract spatiotemporal tokens from both modalities. The decomposition of the frame sequence into tokens lets the model incorporate short-term information from within the token, while being able to make long-term connections between tokens throughout the sequence. The core of the system consists of a dual-stream Transformer architecture to process the extracted sequences independently before fusing the two modalities. Additionally, we apply a saliency-based masking scheme to the input frames to learn an embedding that facilitates the recognition of deviations from previous outputs. We observe that the additional prior information aids in the first detection of the salient location. Our findings indicate that the ratio of spatiotemporal long- and short-term features directly impacts the model's performance. While increasing the short-term context is beneficial up to a certain threshold, the model's performance greatly benefits from an expansion of the long-term context.</p></details> |  | None |
