Then, there is still a scarcity of publicly available high-quality datasets on student-teacher behaviors. We constructed SCB-Dataset a comprehensive dataset of student and teacher classroom behaviors covering 19 classes. SCB-Dataset is divided into two types: Object Detection and Image Classification. The Object Detection part includes 13,330 images and 122,977 labels, and the Image Classification part includes 21,019 images. We conducted benchmark tests on SCB-Dataset using YOLO series algorithms and Large vision-language model. We believe that SCB-Dataset can provide a solid foundation for future applications of artificial intelligence in education.

| **[Masked Clustering Prediction for Unsupervised Point Cloud Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08910v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new competitive results. The code and models will be released at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.</p></details> | <details><summary>3D po...</summary><p>3D point cloud pretraining method. 8 pages in the main manuscript</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu) |
| **[PAD-F: Prior-Aware Debiasing Framework for Long-Tailed X-ray Prohibited Item Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18078v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting prohibited items in X-ray security imagery is a challenging yet crucial task. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, object detection algorithms have been widely applied in this area. However, the distribution of object classes in real-world prohibited item detection scenarios often exhibits a distinct long-tailed distribution. Due to the unique principles of X-ray imaging, conventional methods for long-tailed object detection are often ineffective in this domain. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Prior-Aware Debiasing Framework (PAD-F), a novel approach that employs a two-pronged strategy leveraging both material and co-occurrence priors. At the data level, our Explicit Material-Aware Augmentation (EMAA) component generates numerous challenging training samples for tail classes. It achieves this through a placement strategy guided by material-specific absorption rates and a gradient-based Poisson blending technique. At the feature level, the Implicit Co-occurrence Aggregator (ICA) acts as a plug-in module that enhances features for ambiguous objects by implicitly learning and aggregating statistical co-occurrence relationships within the image. Extensive experiments on the HiXray and PIDray datasets demonstrate that PAD-F significantly boosts the performance of multiple popular detectors. It achieves an absolute improvement of up to +17.2% in AP50 for tail classes and comprehensively outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides an effective and versatile solution to the critical problem of long-tailed detection in X-ray security.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Efficient Annotation of Medieval Charters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14071v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diplomatics, the analysis of medieval charters, is a major field of research in which paleography is applied. Annotating data, if performed by laymen, needs validation and correction by experts. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient annotation approach for charter segmentation, essentially reducing it to object detection. This approach allows for a much more efficient use of the paleographer's time and produces results that can compete and even outperform pixel-level segmentation in some use cases. Further experiments shed light on how to design a class ontology in order to make the best use of annotators' time and effort. Exploiting the presence of calibration cards in the image, we further annotate the data with the physical length in pixels and train regression neural networks to predict it from image patches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Designing Object Detection Models for TinyML: Foundations, Comparative Analysis, Challenges, and Emerging Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08352v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment. Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field: https://github.com/christophezei/Optimizing-Object-Detection-Models-for-TinyML-A-Comprehensive-Survey.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/christophezei/Optimizing-Object-Detection-Models-for-TinyML-A-Comprehensive-Survey) |
| **[Sample-aware RandAugment: Search-free Automatic Data Augmentation for Effective Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08004v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric, search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data, enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample. Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs applicable to a variety of future tasks.

| **[Autonomous Navigation of Cloud-Controlled Quadcopters in Confined Spaces Using Multi-Modal Perception and LLM-Driven High Semantic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07885v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an advanced AI-driven perception system for autonomous quadcopter navigation in GPS-denied indoor environments. The proposed framework leverages cloud computing to offload computationally intensive tasks and incorporates a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) for efficient sensor data acquisition, enabling robust navigation in confined spaces. The system integrates YOLOv11 for object detection, Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth estimation, a PCB equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object detection achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.6, depth estimation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42 trials over approximately 11 minutes, and end-to-end system latency below 1 second. This cloud-supported, high-intelligence framework serves as an auxiliary perception and navigation system, complementing state-of-the-art drone autonomy for GPS-denied confined spaces.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CBDES MoE: Hierarchically Decoupled Mixture-of-Experts for Functional Modules in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07838v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS, demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SwarmVLM: VLM-Guided Impedance Control for Autonomous Navigation of Heterogeneous Robots in Dynamic Warehousing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07814v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing demand for efficient logistics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being paired with automated guided vehicles (AGVs). While UAVs offer the ability to navigate through dense environments and varying altitudes, they are limited by battery life, payload capacity, and flight duration, necessitating coordinated ground support. Focusing on heterogeneous navigation, SwarmVLM addresses these limitations by enabling semantic collaboration between UAVs and ground robots through impedance control. The system leverages the Vision Language Model (VLM) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to adjust impedance control parameters in response to environmental changes. In this framework, the UAV acts as a leader using Artificial Potential Field (APF) planning for real-time navigation, while the ground robot follows via virtual impedance links with adaptive link topology to avoid collisions with short obstacles. The system demonstrated a 92% success rate across 12 real-world trials. Under optimal lighting conditions, the VLM-RAG framework achieved 8% accuracy in object detection and selection of impedance parameters. The mobile robot prioritized short obstacle avoidance, occasionally resulting in a lateral deviation of up to 50 cm from the UAV path, which showcases safe navigation in a cluttered setting.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MambaTrans: Multimodal Fusion Image Translation via Large Language Model Priors for Downstream Visual Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07803v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images. To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SparseTem: Boosting the Efficiency of CNN-Based Video Encoders by Exploiting Temporal Continuity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20790v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.</p></details> | 9 pages, 13 figures | None |

Despite their importance, publicly available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model (LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset construction in complex real-world domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Customized Knowledge Distillation for Chip-Level Dense Image Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13174v5)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been revealed that efficient dense image prediction (EDIP) models designed for AI chips, trained using the knowledge distillation (KD) framework, encounter two key challenges, including \emph{maintaining boundary region completeness} and \emph{ensuring target region connectivity}, despite their favorable real-time capacity to recognize the main object regions. In this work, we propose a customized boundary and context knowledge distillation (BCKD) method for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted KD from large accurate teacher models to compact small student models. Specifically, the \emph{boundary distillation} focuses on extracting explicit object-level boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Meanwhile, the \emph{context distillation} leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions. Our proposed method is specifically designed for the EDIP tasks and is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results across semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on five representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BCKD, resulting in well-defined object boundaries and smooth connecting regions.</p></details> | under submission | None |
| **[Griffon v2: Advancing Multimodal Perception with High-Resolution Scaling and Visual-Language Co-Referring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09333v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models have achieved fine-grained object perception, but the limitation of image resolution remains a significant obstacle to surpassing the performance of task-specific experts in complex and dense scenarios. Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, counting, \textit{etc}. To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts. To efficiently scale up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models. This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details and significantly improves multimodal perception ability, especially for small objects. Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer. It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts, and even coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC and phrase grounding, and outperform expert models in object detection, object counting, and REG.

| **[Enhancing Egocentric Object Detection in Static Environments using Graph-based Spatial Anomaly Detection and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07624v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However, state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work, we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%. This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GAPNet: A Lightweight Framework for Image and Video Salient Object Detection via Granularity-Aware Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07585v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models.

| **[Decoupled Functional Evaluation of Autonomous Driving Models via Feature Map Quality Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07552v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a 3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Firstly, we motivate the study using two separate real-world experiments to showcase that indeed glass failures would cause the detection based neural network models to fail. Secondly, we develop a simulation-based study using the physical process of the glass breakage to create perturbed scenarios, representing a realistic class of physics-based adversarial samples. Using a finite element model (FEM)-based approach, we generate surface cracks on the camera image by applying a stress field defined by particles within a triangular mesh. Lastly, we use physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to provide realistic visualizations of these physically plausible fractures. To analyze the safety implications, we superimpose these simulated broken glass effects as image filters on widely used open-source datasets: KITTI and BDD100K using two most prominent object detection neural networks (CNN-based -- YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN) and Pyramid Vision Transformers. To further investigate the distributional impact of these visual distortions, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between three distinct data distributions, applying various broken glass filters to a custom dataset (captured through a cracked windshield), as well as the KITTI and Kaggle cats and dogs datasets. The K-L divergence analysis suggests that these broken glass filters do not introduce significant distributional shifts.</p></details> |  | None |

Self-distillation recently is emerging as a promising approach for fine-tuning VLMs to better adapt to local regions without requiring extensive annotations. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from significant `foreground bias', where models tend to wrongly identify background regions as foreground objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. DenseVLM leverages the pre-trained VLM to retrieve categories for unlabeled regions and then decouples the interference between foreground and background features. We show that DenseVLM can directly replace the original VLM in open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation methods, leading to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, it exhibits promising zero-shot scalability when training on more extensive and diverse datasets.

However, most KD methods treat all samples uniformly, overlooking the varying learning value of each sample and thereby limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Entropy-based Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (EA-KD), a simple yet effective plug-and-play KD method that prioritizes learning from valuable samples. EA-KD quantifies each sample's learning value by strategically combining the entropy of the teacher and student output, then dynamically reweights the distillation loss to place greater emphasis on high-entropy samples. Extensive experiments across diverse KD frameworks and tasks -- including image classification, object detection, and large language model (LLM) distillation -- demonstrate that EA-KD consistently enhances performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with negligible computational cost.

However, achieving this capability in lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks.

Traditional approaches treat detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view detection and forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

To address this, we propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model designed to enhance Complex VQA performance through the deep fusion of diverse visual and linguistic information. MV-CoRe meticulously integrates global embeddings from pre-trained Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Language Large Models (LLMs) with fine-grained semantic-aware visual features, including object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks, including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of both object and scene graph features, and human evaluations further validate MV-CoRe's superior factual correctness and reasoning depth, underscoring its robust capabilities for deep visual and conceptual understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WeatherDiffusion: Weather-Guided Diffusion Model for Forward and Inverse Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06982v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD). However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task. The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention (MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

While vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline. DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores, expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment, especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, Preprint under review.

However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising <2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models. This work aims to pave the way for further advancements in SAR object detection.

While a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, most of these studies have overlooked the valuable prior knowledge embedded within remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be useful because remote sensing objects may be mistakenly recognized without referencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different objects. This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone. LSKNet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing images. Without bells and whistles, our lightweight LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art scores on standard remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our comprehensive analysis further validated the significance of the identified priors and the effectiveness of LSKNet.

| **[Distribution-Specific Learning for Joint Salient and Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06063v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks. However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks, assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy (SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our proposed method.

However, existing methods suffer from inefficient feature leverage and high computational costs due to redundant feature processing and rigid query allocation. To address these challenges, we propose Dome-DETR, a novel framework with Density-Oriented Feature-Query Manipulation for Efficient Tiny Object Detection. To reduce feature redundancies, we introduce a lightweight Density-Focal Extractor (DeFE) to produce clustered compact foreground masks. Leveraging these masks, we incorporate Masked Window Attention Sparsification (MWAS) to focus computational resources on the most informative regions via sparse attention. Besides, we propose Progressive Adaptive Query Initialization (PAQI), which adaptively modulates query density across spatial areas for better query allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dome-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance (+3.3 AP on AI-TOD-V2 and +2.5 AP on VisDrone) while maintaining low computational complexity and a compact model size.

| **[Towards a General-Purpose Zero-Shot Synthetic Low-Light Image and Video Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12169v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light conditions pose significant challenges for both human and machine annotation. This in turn has led to a lack of research into machine understanding for low-light images and (in particular) videos. A common approach is to apply annotations obtained from high quality datasets to synthetically created low light versions. In addition, these approaches are often limited through the use of unrealistic noise models. In this paper, we propose a new Degradation Estimation Network (DEN), which synthetically generates realistic standard RGB (sRGB) noise without the requirement for camera metadata. This is achieved by estimating the parameters of physics-informed noise distributions, trained in a self-supervised manner. This zero-shot approach allows our method to generate synthetic noisy content with a diverse range of realistic noise characteristics, unlike other methods which focus on recreating the noise characteristics of the training data. We evaluate our proposed synthetic pipeline using various methods trained on its synthetic data for typical low-light tasks including synthetic noise replication, video enhancement, and object detection, showing improvements of up to 24\% KLD, 21\% LPIPS, and 62\% AP$_{50-95}$, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Textual Inversion for Efficient Adaptation of Open-Vocabulary Object Detectors Without Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05323v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities. Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen, retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CoCAViT: Compact Vision Transformer with Robust Global Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05307v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks. However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation. Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of 224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, while maintaining low latency.</p></details> |  | None |

To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to explore multi-task generation for remote sensing, tackling the challenge of limited generalization in task-oriented synthesis for RSI interpretation. EarthSynth, trained on the EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training strategy with a three-dimensional batch-sample selection mechanism to improve training data diversity and enhance category control. Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world scenarios. There are significant improvements in open-vocabulary understanding tasks, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.</p></details> | 25 pages | None |

However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs. Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and deployability.</p></details> |  | None |

Its variant Adaptive ULU (\textbf{AULU}) is expressed as $\{f(x;\beta_1^2),x=0 \}$, where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are learnable parameters, enabling it to adapt its response separately for positive and negative inputs. Additionally, we introduce the LIB (Like Inductive Bias) metric from AULU to quantitatively measure the inductive bias of the model.</p></details> |  | None |

Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area, called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i) allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision (mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Label Error Detection to Correction: A Modular Framework and Benchmark for Object Detection Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06556v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels, incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features, boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query adaptation and dual-stream attention.

BEV perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to conventional task-specific optimizations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04489v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample. Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of publication.</p></details> |  | None |

Removing the illumination effects and enhancing the quality of such images is crucial for many tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection. In this paper, we propose a variational method for low-light image enhancement based on the Retinex decomposition into illumination, reflectance, and noise components. A color correction pre-processing step is applied to the low-light image, which is then used as the observed input in the decomposition. Moreover, our model integrates a novel nonlocal gradient-type fidelity term designed to preserve structural details. Additionally, we propose an automatic gamma correction module. Building on the proposed variational approach, we extend the model by introducing its deep unfolding counterpart, in which the proximal operators are replaced with learnable networks. We propose cross-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in both the nonlocal prior of the reflectance and the nonlocal gradient-based constraint. Experimental results demonstrate that both methods compare favorably with several recent and state-of-the-art techniques across different datasets. In particular, despite not relying on learning strategies, the variational model outperforms most deep learning approaches both visually and in terms of quality metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

This study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this, a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at the 13th European Workshop on Visual Information Processing (EUVIP 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, static fusion heuristics and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines, DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95 across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE DSAA 2025 (10 pages, 5 figures)</p></details> | None |

Despite the tremendous advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods, distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level, neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation). We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, This paper was submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems</p></details> | None |
| **[Robust Single-Stage Fully Sparse 3D Object Detection via Detachable Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03252v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust 3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this, we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object \textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations. Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference, further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adversarial Attention Perturbations for Large Object Detection Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02987v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks, increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second, AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to 83% with superior speed and imperceptibility.

Leveraging a theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures, highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

To enable virtual element detection, we further contribute DISCOVR, a VR dataset consisting of 30 virtual object classes from 17 social VR apps, substituting real-world datasets that remain not applicable to VR contexts. Nine participants used VRSight to explore an off-the-shelf VR app (Rec Room), demonstrating its effectiveness in facilitating social tasks like avatar awareness and available seat identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, LaTeX; To be published in ACM's 2025 Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Infrared Object Detection with Ultra Small ConvNets: Is ImageNet Pretraining Still Useful?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02927v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models, pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working conditions are different.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluation and Analysis of Deep Neural Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on Modern Remote Sensing Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02871v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers, we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such, it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper, we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity. Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction methodologies and detection algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the development of image analysis methods for EBCs is challenging due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of the data. This work addresses the problem of object detection for EBC cameras. The current approaches to EBC object detection focus on constructing complex data representations and rely on specialized architectures. We introduce I2EvDet (Image-to-Event Detection), a novel adaptation framework that bridges mainstream object detection with temporal event data processing. First, we demonstrate that a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer, or RT-DETR, a state-of-the-art natural image detector, trained on a simple image-like representation of the EBC data achieves performance comparable to specialized EBC methods. Next, as part of our framework, we develop an efficient adaptation technique that transforms image-based detectors into event-based detection models by modifying their frozen latent representation space through minimal architectural additions. The resulting EvRT-DETR model reaches state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark datasets Gen1 (mAP $+2.3$) and 1Mpx/Gen4 (mAP $+1.4$). These results demonstrate a fundamentally new approach to EBC object detection through principled adaptation of mainstream architectures, offering an efficient alternative with potential applications to other temporal visual domains.

However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. To underpin of efficiency of our approach we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns, particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception models.</p></details> | <details><summary>J.

While human-object interaction (HOI) detection has made some progress in general-purpose video downstream tasks, when applied to recognize the interaction behaviors between a streamer and different objects in livestreaming, it tends to focuses too much on the objects and neglects their interactions with the streamer, which leads to object bias. To solve this issue, we propose a prototype embedding optimization for human-object interaction detection (PeO-HOI). First, the livestreaming is preprocessed using object detection and tracking techniques to extract features of the human-object (HO) pairs. Then, prototype embedding optimization is adopted to mitigate the effect of object bias on HOI. Finally, after modelling the spatio-temporal context between HO pairs, the HOI detection results are obtained by the prediction head. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed PeO-HOI method has detection accuracies of 37.19%@full, 51.42%@non-rare, 26.20%@rare on the publicly available dataset VidHOI, 45.13%@full, 62.78%@non-rare and 30.37%@rare on the self-built dataset BJUT-HOI, which effectively improves the HOI detection performance in livestreaming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE MMSP 2025</p></details> | None |

Robots must analyze interactions with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified. Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis. Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets. The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is optimal for this task.</p></details> |  | None |

COLER first uses our developed CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image. We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models, but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.</p></details> |  | None |

While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios. Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution, offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both. Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception.

Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation. For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275, improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all scale-agnostic metrics.

Although neuromorphic event cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features, and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by 7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we pioneer in probing the cross-device (cameras & robotics) grasping policy in the 3D open world. Specifically, we construct two real-world grasping setups, employing robotic arms and cameras from completely different manufacturers. To minimize domain differences in point clouds from diverse cameras, we adopt clustering methods to generate 3D object proposals. However, existing clustering methods are limited to closed-set scenarios, which confines the robotic graspable object categories and ossifies the deployment scenarios. To extend these methods to open-world settings, we introduce the SSGC-Seg module that enables category-agnostic 3D object detection. The proposed module transforms the original multi-class semantic information into binary semantic cues-foreground and background by analyzing the SoftMax value of each point, and then clusters the foreground points based on geometric information to form initial object proposals. Furthermore, ScoreNet{\ddag} is designed to score each detection result, and the robotic arm prioritizes grasping the object with the highest confidence score. Experiments on two different types of setups highlight the effectiveness and robustness of our policy for cross-device robotics grasping research. Our code is provided in the supplementary and will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

Although it has shown promise in image classification tasks, its extension to other visual tasks has been limited. This limitation arises primarily from two factors: 1) architectures designed specifically for classification are not readily adaptable to other tasks, which prevents the effective reuse of task-specific knowledge from architectures tailored to different problems; 2) these classification-focused architectures typically lack cross-scale feature communication, leading to degraded performance in tasks like object detection and super-resolution. To address these challenges, we propose the Feature Bank Augmented auxiliary network (FBA), which introduces a simplified design principle and incorporates a feature bank to enhance cross-task adaptability and communication. This work represents the first successful application of local learning methods beyond classification, demonstrating that FBA not only conserves GPU memory but also achieves performance on par with end-to-end approaches across multiple datasets for various visual tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present a systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders, employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance, especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8 achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for label-efficient object detection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate, real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus, for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data, independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

This architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial inspections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 ICCV VISION Workshop</p></details> | None |

For localization, the proposed 3D Novel Object Discovery (3D-NOD) strategy utilizes 3D geometries and 2D open-vocabulary semantic priors to discover pseudo labels for novel objects during training. 3D-NOD is further extended with an Enrichment strategy that significantly enriches the novel object distribution in the training scenes, and then enhances the model's ability to localize more novel objects. The 3D-NOD with Enrichment is termed 3D-NODE. For classification, the Discovery-driven Cross-modal Alignment (DCMA) module aligns features from 3D point clouds and 2D/textual modalities, employing both class-agnostic and class-specific alignments that are iteratively refined to handle the expanding vocabulary of objects. Besides, 2D box guidance boosts the classification accuracy against complex background noises, which is coined as Box-DCMA. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of CoDAv2. CoDAv2 outperforms the best-performing method by a large margin (AP_Novel of 9.17 vs. 3.61 on SUN-RGBD and 9.12 vs. 3.74 on ScanNetv2).

| **[Adverse Weather-Independent Framework Towards Autonomous Driving Perception through Temporal Correlation and Unfolded Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01583v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various adverse weather conditions such as fog and rain pose a significant challenge to autonomous driving (AD) perception tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, etc. The common domain adaption strategy is to minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather conditions. However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain in practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and performs poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse weather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model architecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is achieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of clear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition. Specifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential Mechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to achieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind arbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed to shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence to prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded Regularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather generalization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess the proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.14737</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive LiDAR Scanning: Harnessing Temporal Cues for Efficient 3D Object Detection via Multi-Modal Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01562v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense, stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes. This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption, limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network, which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion methods with dense LiDAR scanning.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional label-efficient methods focus on object-centric features, neglecting contextual semantic relationships that are critical in complex scenes. In this work, we propose a Context-Aware Weak Supervision for Monocular 3D object detection, namely CA-W3D, to address this limitation in a two-stage training paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a pre-training stage employing Region-wise Object Contrastive Matching (ROCM), which aligns regional object embeddings derived from a trainable monocular 3D encoder and a frozen open-vocabulary 2D visual grounding model. This alignment encourages the monocular encoder to discriminate scene-specific attributes and acquire richer contextual knowledge. In the second stage, we incorporate a pseudo-label training process with a Dual-to-One Distillation (D2OD) mechanism, which effectively transfers contextual priors into the monocular encoder while preserving spatial fidelity and maintaining computational efficiency during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on the public KITTI benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing the SoTA method over all metrics, highlighting the importance of contextual-aware knowledge in weakly-supervised monocular 3D detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6 FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers stable performance.

Two key challenges in Knowledge Distillation (KD) are: 1) balancing learning from the teacher's guidance and the task objective, and 2) handling the disparity in knowledge representation between teacher and student models. To address these, we propose Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation (MoKD). MoKD tackles two main gradient issues: a) Gradient Conflicts, where task-specific and distillation gradients are misaligned, and b) Gradient Dominance, where one objective's gradient dominates, causing imbalance. MoKD reformulates KD as a multi-objective optimization problem, enabling better balance between objectives. Additionally, it introduces a subspace learning framework to project feature representations into a high-dimensional space, improving knowledge transfer. Our MoKD is demonstrated to outperform existing methods through extensive experiments on image classification using the ImageNet-1K dataset and object detection using the COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, MoKD models also achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to models trained from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major changes to the paper and the authorship</p></details> | None |
| **[Spatial-Frequency Aware for Object Detection in RAW Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01396v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data (unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the ``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma parameters for the two domains.</p></details> |  | None |

However, our analysis indicates that under the full fine-tuning paradigm, the feature space becomes highly constrained and low-ranked, which has been proven to seriously impair generalization. One solution is freezing parameters to preserve pre-trained knowledge and thus maintain diversity of the feature space. To this end, we propose IV-tuning, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various IR-VIS downstream tasks, including salient object detection, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Compared with the full fine-tuning baselines and existing IR-VIS methods, IV-tuning facilitates the learning of complementary information between infrared and visible modalities with less than 3% of the backbone parameters, and effectively alleviates the overfitting problem.

Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

For this problem, we first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers 18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, major challenges such as a lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features, in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance. Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets. This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.</p></details> |  | None |

We re-examined the DETR-inspired detection head and found substantial redundancy in its self-attention module. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header inspired by human visual perception: when observing an object, we always concentrate on one site, perceive the surrounding environment, and glance around the object. This mechanism enables each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature dimensions and scale information from different patterns. CSDN provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-trained weights can significantly improve the detection accuracy.</p></details> | 7pages, 7figures | None |

Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard, vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness and contribute to long-term space sustainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Wireless for Space and Extreme Environments (WiSEE 2025)</p></details> | None |

Despite achieving high detection performance, most of the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29% reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2% drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at the Embedded Vision Workshop ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, obtaining such annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is limited.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reducing the gap between general purpose data and aerial images in concentrated solar power plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00440v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for rapid deployment in industrial applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment, significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling.

However, such pairs often contain noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | Work in progress | None |

Multi-level semantic understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations: Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI, and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios.

Modern LiDARs face key challenges in several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects, producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds. We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

However, this conventional approach overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon, an efficient encoder-decoder self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that supports joint contrastive pre-training. We first extend existing SSL architectures to accommodate diverse decoders and their corresponding contrastive losses. Then, we introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives to enable the joint pre-training of encoder-decoder architectures. By adapting an established contrastive SSL framework for dense prediction tasks, DeCon achieves new state-of-the-art results: on COCO object detection and instance segmentation when pre-trained on COCO dataset; across almost all dense downstream benchmark tasks when pre-trained on COCO+ and ImageNet-1K. Our results demonstrate that joint pre-training enhances the representation power of the encoder and improves performance in dense prediction tasks. This gain persists across heterogeneous decoder architectures, various encoder architectures, and in out-of-domain limited-data scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally, the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba.

Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD). We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed 3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for more efficient cross-dataset training.

However, existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically, ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training. Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

To address the problem of feature extraction limitation and information loss in the existing YOLO-based models, this study propose You Only Look Once for Fire Detection with Attention-guided Inverted Residual and Dual-pooling Downscale Fusion (YOLO-FireAD) with two core innovations: (1) Attention-guided Inverted Residual Block (AIR) integrates hybrid channel-spatial attention with inverted residuals to adaptively enhance fire features and suppress environmental noise; (2) Dual Pool Downscale Fusion Block (DPDF) preserves multi-scale fire patterns through learnable fusion of max-average pooling outputs, mitigating small-fire detection failures. Extensive evaluation on two public datasets shows the efficient performance of our model. Our proposed model keeps the sum amount of parameters (1.45M, 51.8% lower than YOLOv8n) (4.6G, 43.2% lower than YOLOv8n), and mAP75 is higher than the mainstream real-time object detection models YOLOv8n, YOL-Ov9t, YOLOv10n, YOLO11n, YOLOv12n and other YOLOv8 variants 1.3-5.5%.

However, TIR images typically suffer from heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Thermal Infrared in Robotics (TIRO) Workshop, ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DISTIL: Data-Free Inversion of Suspicious Trojan Inputs via Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22813v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious "shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training. Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier; through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to 7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong prior assumptions about triggers.

While LiDAR and visual (RGB) sensors are commonly used, thermal imaging remains underrepresented in datasets, despite its acknowledged advantages for VRU detection in extreme lighting conditions. In this paper, we present R-LiViT, the first dataset to combine LiDAR, RGB, and thermal imaging from a roadside perspective, with a strong focus on VRUs. R-LiViT captures three intersections during both day and night, ensuring a diverse dataset. It includes 10,000 LiDAR frames and 2,400 temporally and spatially aligned RGB and thermal images across 150 traffic scenarios, with 7 and 8 annotated classes respectively, providing a comprehensive resource for tasks such as object detection and tracking.

However, existing methods often construct BEV representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next, we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving 49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set.

Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.01788, arXiv:2304.01168 by other authors</p></details> | None |

Recent works show that when trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts. Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

Ground based tracking requires setting up infrastructure, could be range limited, and may not be feasible in remote areas, crowded cities or in dense vegetation areas. Vision based active tracking of aerial objects from another airborne vehicle, e.g., a chaser unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), promises to fill this important gap, along with serving aerial coordination use cases. Vision-based active tracking by a UAV entails solving two coupled problems: 1) compute-efficient and accurate (target) object detection and target state estimation; and 2) maneuver decisions to ensure that the target remains in the field of view in the future time-steps and favorably positioned for continued detection. As a solution to the first problem, this paper presents a novel integration of standard deep learning based architectures with Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) to achieve compute-efficient object detection without compromising accuracy, unlike standalone learning or filtering approaches. The proposed perception framework is validated using a lab-scale setup. For the second problem, to obviate the linearity assumptions and background variations limiting effectiveness of the traditional controllers, we present the use of reinforcement learning to train a neuro-controller for fast computation of velocity maneuvers. New state space, action space and reward formulations are developed for this purpose, and training is performed in simulation using AirSim. The trained model is also tested in AirSim with respect to complex target maneuvers, and is found to outperform a baseline PID control in terms of tracking up-time and average distance maintained (from the target) during tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of AIAA Aviation 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing RGB-D VSOD models have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD. Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19 state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the efficacy of SMFNet as well.

We present a tailored object detection framework for identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25 fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area. Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in current detection architectures.

It presents technical challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

Extensive research is dedicated to the RGB-IR object detection, primarily focusing on how to integrate complementary features from RGB-IR modalities. However, they neglect the mono-modality insufficient learning problem, which arises from decreased feature extraction capability in multi-modal joint learning. This leads to a prevalent but unreasonable phenomenon\textemdash Fusion Degradation, which hinders the performance improvement of the MMOD model. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce linear probing evaluation to the multi-modal detectors and rethink the multi-modal object detection task from the mono-modality learning perspective. Therefore, we construct a novel framework called M$^2$D-LIF, which consists of the Mono-Modality Distillation (M$^2$D) method and the Local Illumination-aware Fusion (LIF) module. The M$^2$D-LIF framework facilitates the sufficient learning of mono-modality during multi-modal joint training and explores a lightweight yet effective feature fusion manner to achieve superior object detection performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three MMOD datasets demonstrate that our M$^2$D-LIF effectively mitigates the Fusion Degradation phenomenon and outperforms the previous SOTA detectors.

However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios.

While recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86% while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost. These results demonstrate that PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS across diverse vision tasks.</p></details> | 14pages | None |

To address this issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks, achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features. Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features, thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion detection algorithm on two datasets.

The ISB module innovatively reconstructs feature maps to establish an efficient full-channel global attention mechanism through synergistic fusion of batch-statistical and instance-specific features. Complementing this, the ISADH module pioneers an asymmetric decoupled architecture enabling hierarchical multi-dimensional feature integration via dual-stream batch-instance representation fusion. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the coordinated deployment of ISB and ISADH in the YOLO-PRO framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all computational scales. Specifically, YOLO-PRO surpasses YOLOv8 by 1.0-1.6% AP (N/S/M/L/X scales) and outperforms YOLO11 by 0.1-0.5% AP in critical N/M/L/X groups, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

This not only enhances pollination efficiency but also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing. Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%, representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively, over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set, meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2 offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Point Cloud Self-supervised Learning via 3D to Multi-view Masked Learner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10887v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multi-modal masked autoencoders (MAE) has been introduced in 3D self-supervised learning, offering enhanced feature learning by leveraging both 2D and 3D data to capture richer cross-modal representations. However, these approaches have two limitations: (1) they inefficiently require both 2D and 3D modalities as inputs, even though the inherent multi-view properties of 3D point clouds already contain 2D modality. (2) input 2D modality causes the reconstruction learning to unnecessarily rely on visible 2D information, hindering 3D geometric representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D to Multi-View Learner (Multi-View ML) that only utilizes 3D modalities as inputs and effectively capture rich spatial information in 3D point clouds. Specifically, we first project 3D point clouds to multi-view 2D images at the feature level based on 3D-based pose. Then, we introduce two components: (1) a 3D to multi-view autoencoder that reconstructs point clouds and multi-view images from 3D and projected 2D features; (2) a multi-scale multi-head (MSMH) attention mechanism that facilitates local-global information interactions in each decoder transformer block through attention heads at various scales.

| **[VESPA: Towards un(Human)supervised Open-World Pointcloud Labeling for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20397v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding. Code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network (WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection. Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

When integrating such models into aeronautical applications, a top-down safety assessment process must influence both the model performance metrics selected, and their acceptable range of values. Often, however, the relationship of system safety objectives to model performance requirements and the associated metrics is unclear. Using an example of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt component (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first describes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior. Then, based on that abstraction, an initial method is given to derive the minimum safety-related performance requirements, the associated metrics, and their targets for the both MLC and its underlying deep neural network, such that they meet the quantitative safety objectives obtained from the safety assessment process. We give rationale as to why the proposed method should be considered valid, also clarifying the assumptions made, the constraints on applicability, and the implications for verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, Expanded version of the paper: G.

Current approaches face significant limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting," and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering. Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data, while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved annotation quality of our visualization system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures | None |

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance.

| **[DS-Det: Single-Query Paradigm and Attention Disentangled Learning for Flexible Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19807v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number (fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention (query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det, a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible. Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process), addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects. Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of DS-Det.

Existing approaches that use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.</p></details> | ICCVW 2025 | None |

While recent deep learning-based approaches have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme: feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time, making it well-suited for real-time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 36th British Machine Vision Conference</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

These features are continuously updated via over-the-air (OTA) mechanisms, resulting in a growing number of software versions and variants due to the diversity of vehicles, cloud/edge environments, and stakeholders involved. The lack of a unified integration environment further complicates development, as connected mobility solutions are often built in isolation. To ensure reliable operations across heterogeneous systems, a dynamic orchestration of functions that considers hardware and software variability is essential. This paper presents an open-source CI/CD pipeline tailored for SDVs. It automates the build, test, and deployment phases using a combination of containerized open-source tools, creating a standardized, portable, and scalable ecosystem accessible to all stakeholders. Additionally, a custom OTA middleware distributes software updates and supports rollbacks across vehicles and backend services. Update variants are derived based on deployment target dependencies and hardware configurations. The pipeline also supports continuous development and deployment of AI models for autonomous driving features. Its effectiveness is evaluated using an automated valet parking (AVP) scenario involving TurtleBots and a coordinating backend server. Two object detection variants are developed and deployed to match hardware-specific requirements. Results demonstrate seamless OTA updates, correct variant selection, and successful orchestration across all targets. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable and efficient solution for managing software variants and OTA updates in SDVs, contributing to the advancement of future mobility technologies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet transmitting raw point clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark, EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately 1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.

To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However, effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection.

Existing roadside perception methods concentrate on model design but overlook data issues like calibration errors, sparse information, and multi-view consistency, leading to poor performance on recent published datasets. To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70.

Existing methods primarily extract features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters.

Existing methods are primarily CNN-based and improve robustness through data augmentation combined with feature alignment. However, these methods are limited, as augmentation is only effective when the synthetic distribution approximates that of unseen domains, thus failing to ensure generalization across diverse scenarios. While DEtection TRansformer (DETR) has shown strong generalization in domain adaptation due to global context modeling, its potential for SDG remains underexplored. To this end, we propose Style-Adaptive DEtection TRansformer (SA-DETR), a DETR-based detector tailored for SDG. SA-DETR introduces an online domain style adapter that projects the style representation of unseen domains into the source domain via a dynamic memory bank. This bank self-organizes into diverse style prototypes and is continuously updated under a test-time adaptation framework, enabling effective style rectification. Additionally, we design an object-aware contrastive learning module to promote extraction of domain-invariant features. By applying gating masks that constrain contrastive learning in both spatial and semantic dimensions, this module facilitates instance-level cross-domain contrast and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments across five distinct weather scenarios demonstrate that SA-DETR consistently outperforms existing methods in both detection accuracy and domain generalization capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</p></details> | None |

This study evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI) approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour. The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to 1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%, and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required to search large vehicle images datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally, to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants: WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or inference cost.</p></details> | 8 pages, conference | None |

In particular, for certain specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework (CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization. Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD.

| **[Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

| **[Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks.

Here, we focus on graphical humor as a paradigmatic example of image interpretation that requires elucidating the interaction of different scene elements in the context of prior cognitive knowledge. This paper introduces \textbf{HumorDB}, a novel, controlled, and carefully curated dataset designed to evaluate and advance visual humor understanding by AI systems. The dataset comprises diverse images spanning photos, cartoons, sketches, and AI-generated content, including minimally contrastive pairs where subtle edits differentiate between humorous and non-humorous versions. We evaluate humans, state-of-the-art vision models, and large vision-language models on three tasks: binary humor classification, funniness rating prediction, and pairwise humor comparison. The results reveal a gap between current AI systems and human-level humor understanding. While pretrained vision-language models perform better than vision-only models, they still struggle with abstract sketches and subtle humor cues. Analysis of attention maps shows that even when models correctly classify humorous images, they often fail to focus on the precise regions that make the image funny. Preliminary mechanistic interpretability studies and evaluation of model explanations provide initial insights into how different architectures process humor. Our results identify promising trends and current limitations, suggesting that an effective understanding of visual humor requires sophisticated architectures capable of detecting subtle contextual features and bridging the gap between visual perception and abstract reasoning.

Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under consideration at Image and Vision Computing</p></details> | None |

Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France. We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these infrastructures in a given area at a given time.</p></details> |  | None |

At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search. SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18 benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL)</p></details> | None |

While many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike previous approaches that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes datasets.

While LMMs have demonstrated promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection, revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det.

Existing deep learning-based methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of accuracy and computational speed when deployed on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, despite these advances, state-of-the-art YOLO-based object detection and classification systems continue to face challenges in achieving resource efficiency suitable for edge FPGA platforms. To address this limitation, this paper presents a resource-efficient real-time object detection and classification system based on YOLOv5 optimized for FPGA deployment. The proposed system is trained on the COCO and GTSRD datasets and implemented on the Xilinx Kria KV260 FPGA board. Experimental results demonstrate a classification accuracy of 99%, with a power consumption of 3.5W and a processing speed of 9 frames per second (FPS). These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling real-time, resource-efficient object detection and classification for edge computing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the 67th International Symposium on ELMAR 2025</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results. The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB), which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands. Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Only recently, novel approaches have emerged tackling this problem in an unsupervised fashion. Generally, these approaches first generate pseudo-masks and then train a class-agnostic detector. While such methods deliver the current state of the art, they often fail to correctly separate instances overlapping in 2D image space since only semantics are considered. To tackle this issue, we instead propose to cut the semantic masks in 3D to obtain the final 2D instances by utilizing a point cloud representation of the scene. Furthermore, we derive a Spatial Importance function, which we use to resharpen the semantics along the 3D borders of instances. Nevertheless, these pseudo-masks are still subject to mask ambiguity. To address this issue, we further propose to augment the training of a class-agnostic detector with three Spatial Confidence components aiming to isolate a clean learning signal. With these contributions, our approach outperforms competing methods across multiple standard benchmarks for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly, leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and applicability.

Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> | None |

This project introduces an automated system for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of 1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392). Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments, significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, practical deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection, comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation. We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models. Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M, as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes.

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion) |

This paper introduces FundusExpert, an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen, achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks, surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%, significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$), demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert) |

To enable cross-modal interaction, we design the dynamic channel reduction within a convolutional block attention module (DCR-CBAM), which facilitates cross-talk between subnetworks by dynamically highlighting salient channel features. Furthermore, the dynamic multi-level aggregation block (DMLAB) is proposed to refine spatial feature representations through adaptive multiscale fusion. Finally, novel regularization losses that enforce channel saliency and spatial selectivity are introduced, leading to compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments using RGB-Depth (KITTI), a novel annotated RGB-Polarimetric dataset, and RGB-Infrared (M$^3$FD) benchmark dataset were conducted. We demonstrate consistent superiority of the proposed approach over the baseline RGB-only DiffusionDet. The modular architecture maintains the original decoding complexity, ensuring efficiency. These results establish the proposed RGBX-DiffusionDet as a flexible multimodal object detection approach, providing new insights into integrating diverse 2D sensing modalities into diffusion-based detection pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges such as object occlusion, variations in the physical properties of items, diversity in X-ray scanning devices, and limited training data hinder accurate and reliable detection of illicit items. Despite the large body of research in the field, reported experimental evaluations are often incomplete, with frequently conflicting outcomes. To shed light on the research landscape and facilitate further research, a systematic, detailed, and thorough comparative evaluation of recent Deep Learning (DL)-based methods for X-ray object detection is conducted. For this, a comprehensive evaluation framework is developed, composed of: a) Six recent, large-scale, and widely used public datasets for X-ray illicit item detection (OPIXray, CLCXray, SIXray, EDS, HiXray, and PIDray), b) Ten different state-of-the-art object detection schemes covering all main categories in the literature, including generic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), custom CNN, generic transformer, and hybrid CNN-transformer architectures, and c) Various detection (mAP50 and mAP50:95) and time/computational-complexity (inference time (ms), parameter size (M), and computational load (GFLOPS)) metrics. A thorough analysis of the results leads to critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a) Overall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection performance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and computational complexity analysis.

This work investigates this domain, revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers, fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space. To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that, pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, pretrained on the private Grounding20M dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects. To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[A Low-Cost Machine Learning Approach for Timber Diameter Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17219v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset (TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight, scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting, particularly in small and medium-sized operations.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we explore LEGO Co-builder, a hybrid benchmark combining real-world LEGO assembly logic with programmatically generated multimodal scenes. The dataset captures stepwise visual states and procedural instructions, allowing controlled evaluation of instruction-following, object detection, and state detection. We introduce a unified framework and assess leading VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen-VL, under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Our results reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, with a maximum F1 score of just 40.54\% on state detection, highlighting gaps in fine-grained visual understanding.

Unlike conventional approaches, EMC2 incorporates a scenario-aware MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition, EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as an end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline methods on Jetson platforms, with similar performance gains on the nuScenes dataset, highlighting its capability to advance reliable, real-time 3D object detection tasks for AVs.

However, their reliance on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS (ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight, detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However, the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset. Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |
| **[Few-Shot Learning in Video and 3D Object Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17079v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot learning (FSL) enables object detection models to recognize novel classes given only a few annotated examples, thereby reducing expensive manual data labeling. This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance. Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal, and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> | None |
| **[Transformer Based Building Boundary Reconstruction using Attraction Field Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17038v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the number of remote satellites orbiting the Earth has grown significantly, streaming vast amounts of high-resolution visual data to support diverse applications across civil, public, and military domains. Among these applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable advancements in object detection and representation using visual data, primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from a single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model, Decoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR, demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data, which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges. Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently, ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and state-of-the-art performance of our method.

Yet, many applications remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees, achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree. Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2 system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

While monitoring tasks have traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space (object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models. However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use and further development.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while having 40% less parameters.

Addressing these background-related challenges is critical to improving model performance. We introduce PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline that integrates YOLOv10 for plant region detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for segmentation. YOLOv10 generates bounding box prompts to guide SAM2, enhancing segmentation accuracy. Both models were fine-tuned on herbarium images and evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient metrics. PlantSAM achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with an IoU of 0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97. Incorporating segmented images into classification models led to consistent performance improvements across five tested botanical traits, with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score improvements of 4.15%. Our findings highlight the importance of background removal in herbarium image analysis, as it significantly enhances classification accuracy by allowing models to focus more effectively on the foreground plant structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

In ego-motion estimation, the stereo event camera setup is commonly adopted due to its direct scale perception and depth recovery. For optimal stereo visual fusion, accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. Considering that few stereo visual calibrators orienting to event cameras exist, based on our previous work eKalibr (an event camera intrinsic calibrator), we propose eKalibr-Stereo for accurate spatiotemporal calibration of event-based stereo visual systems. To improve the continuity of grid pattern tracking, building upon the grid pattern recognition method in eKalibr, an additional motion prior-based tracking module is designed in eKalibr-Stereo to track incomplete grid patterns. Based on tracked grid patterns, a two-step initialization procedure is performed to recover initial guesses of piece-wise B-splines and spatiotemporal parameters, followed by a continuous-time batch bundle adjustment to refine the initialized states to optimal ones. The results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Stereo can achieve accurate event-based stereo spatiotemporal calibration. The implementation of eKalibr-Stereo is open-sourced at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) |

In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However, because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks, performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network, updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks. Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++ offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable alternative to conventional training methods.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-uniGuard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code will be released at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-uniGuard.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-uniGuard) |

To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise, potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals, followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual encoding module, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and positional residuals. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories and difficulty levels.</p></details> |  | None |

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Low-Light Smartphone Dataset (LSD), a large-scale, high-resolution (4K+) dataset collected in the wild across a wide range of challenging lighting conditions (0.1 to 200 lux). LSD contains 6,425 precisely aligned low and normal-light image pairs, selected from over 8,000 dynamic indoor and outdoor scenes through multi-frame acquisition and expert evaluation. To evaluate generalization and aesthetic quality, we collect 2,117 unpaired low-light images from previously unseen devices. To fully exploit LSD, we propose TFFormer, a hybrid model that encodes luminance and chrominance (LC) separately to reduce color-structure entanglement. We further propose a cross-attention-driven joint decoder for context-aware fusion of LC representations, along with LC refinement and LC-guided supervision to significantly enhance perceptual fidelity and structural consistency. TFFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on LSD (+2.45 dB PSNR) and substantially improves downstream vision tasks, such as low-light object detection (+6.80 mAP on ExDark).</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model. Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier removal techniques across multiple public datasets. Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene. Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions. Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance, achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5 of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods, our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency. Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RoundaboutHD: High-Resolution Real-World Urban Environment Benchmark for Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08729v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios, low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40 minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping, high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The dataset and the evaluation code are publicly available at: https://github.com/siri-rouser/RoundaboutHD.git</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/siri-rouser/RoundaboutHD.git) |
| **[UPRE: Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation for Object Detection via Unified Prompt and Representation Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00721v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) presents substantial challenges due to the lack of images in the target domain. Previous approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tackle this challenge, exploiting their zero-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods primarily address domain distribution shifts and overlook the misalignment between the detection task and VLMs, which rely on manually crafted prompts. To overcome these limitations, we propose the unified prompt and representation enhancement (UPRE) framework, which jointly optimizes both textual prompts and visual representations. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-view domain prompt that combines linguistic domain priors with detection-specific knowledge, and a visual representation enhancement module that produces domain style variations. Furthermore, we introduce multi-level enhancement strategies, including relative domain distance and positive-negative separation, which align multi-modal representations at the image level and capture diverse visual representations at the instance level, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in ZSDA detection scenarios.

In this paper, we present a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning (SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval music manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the highest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and retraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully boosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results indicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved with significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a preliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the Anonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across Italy during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand, uncertainty-based AL is not effective and advocates for more usable methods in data-scarcity scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, accepted at IEEE MLSP 2025 (IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing).

| **[Few-Shot Object Detection via Spatial-Channel State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15308v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects: i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii) channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Overall Real-Time Mechanism for Classification and Quality Evaluation of Rice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13764v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rice is one of the most widely cultivated crops globally and has been developed into numerous varieties. The quality of rice during cultivation is primarily determined by its cultivar and characteristics. Traditionally, rice classification and quality assessment rely on manual visual inspection, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. However, with advancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and quality evaluation based on its cultivar and characteristics has become increasingly feasible, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes a real-time evaluation mechanism for comprehensive rice grain assessment, integrating a one-stage object detection approach, a deep convolutional neural network, and traditional machine learning techniques. The proposed framework enables rice variety identification, grain completeness grading, and grain chalkiness evaluation. The rice grain dataset used in this study comprises approximately 20,000 images from six widely cultivated rice varieties in China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.14% in the object detection task and an accuracy of 97.89% in the classification task. Furthermore, the framework attains an average accuracy of 97.56% in grain completeness grading within the same rice variety, contributing to an effective quality evaluation system.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Event-based Graph Representation with Spatial and Motion Vectors for Asynchronous Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15150v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup, reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous vision. Project page: eventbasedvision.github.io/eGSMV.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with 39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6 challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Beyond RGB: Adaptive Parallel Processing for RAW Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13163v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models are typically applied to standard RGB images processed through Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines, which are designed to enhance sensor-captured RAW images for human vision. However, these ISP functions can lead to a loss of critical information that may be essential in optimizing for computer vision tasks, such as object detection. In this work, we introduce Raw Adaptation Module (RAM), a module designed to replace the traditional ISP, with parameters optimized specifically for RAW object detection. Inspired by the parallel processing mechanisms of the human visual system, RAM departs from existing learned ISP methods by applying multiple ISP functions in parallel rather than sequentially, allowing for a more comprehensive capture of image features. These processed representations are then fused in a specialized module, which dynamically integrates and optimizes the information for the target task. This novel approach not only leverages the full potential of RAW sensor data but also enables task-specific pre-processing, resulting in superior object detection performance. Our approach outperforms RGB-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse RAW image datasets under varying lighting conditions and dynamic ranges.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Can Optical Denoising Clean Sonar Images? A Benchmark and Fusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01655v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in sonar images is crucial for underwater robotics applications including autonomous navigation and resource exploration. However, complex noise patterns inherent in sonar imagery, particularly speckle, reverberation, and non-Gaussian noise, significantly degrade detection accuracy. While denoising techniques have achieved remarkable success in optical imaging, their applicability to sonar data remains underexplored. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of nine state-of-the-art deep denoising models with distinct architectures, including Neighbor2Neighbor with varying noise parameters, Blind2Unblind with different noise configurations, and DSPNet, for sonar image preprocessing. We establish a rigorous benchmark using five publicly available sonar datasets and assess their impact on four representative detection algorithms: YOLOX, Faster R-CNN, SSD300, and SSDMobileNetV2. Our evaluation addresses three unresolved questions: first, how effectively optical denoising architectures transfer to sonar data; second, which model families perform best against sonar noise; and third, whether denoising truly improves detection accuracy in practical pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while denoising generally improves detection performance, effectiveness varies across methods due to their inherent biases toward specific noise types. To leverage complementary denoising effects, we propose a mutually-supervised multi-source denoising fusion framework where outputs from different denoisers mutually supervise each other at the pixel level, creating a synergistic framework that produces cleaner images.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional detectors rely on deterministic bounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model robustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement framework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein distance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth distributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter high-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a simple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals. Experiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively integrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance. We further extend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the LISC and WBCDD datasets. These results confirm the scalability of our framework across both general and domain-specific detection tasks.

Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\% to 7.38\%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> | None |

Addressing these issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its generality.

These datasets need to offer diverse and challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures, including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and robust object detection architectures.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

We thoroughly explore the rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments. We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS datasets, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures, | None |

Existing zero-shot techniques commonly utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in automatic mode or rely on vision-language models to generate cues for segmentation; however, their performances remain unsatisfactory, due to the similarity of the camouflaged object and the background. This work studies how to avoid training by integrating large pre-trained models like SAM-2 and Owl-v2 with temporal information into a modular pipeline. Evaluated on the MoCA-Mask dataset, our approach achieves outstanding performance improvements, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot methods by raising the F-measure ($F_\beta^w$) from 0.296 to 0.628. Our approach also surpasses supervised methods, increasing the F-measure from 0.476 to 0.628. Additionally, evaluation on the MoCA-Filter dataset demonstrates an increase in the success rate from 0.628 to 0.697 when compared with FlowSAM, a supervised transfer method. A thorough ablation study further validates the individual contributions of each component. Besides our main contributions, we also highlight inconsistencies in previous work regarding metrics and settings.

Existing methods often rely on appearance features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node, with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing LiDAR Point Features with Foundation Model Priors for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13899v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details. To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CDUPatch: Color-Driven Universal Adversarial Patch Attack for Dual-Modal Visible-Infrared Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10888v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial patches are widely used to evaluate the robustness of object detection systems in real-world scenarios. These patches were initially designed to deceive single-modal detectors (e.g., visible or infrared) and have recently been extended to target visible-infrared dual-modal detectors. However, existing dual-modal adversarial patch attacks have limited attack effectiveness across diverse physical scenarios. To address this, we propose CDUPatch, a universal cross-modal patch attack against visible-infrared object detectors across scales, views, and scenarios. Specifically, we observe that color variations lead to different levels of thermal absorption, resulting in temperature differences in infrared imaging. Leveraging this property, we propose an RGB-to-infrared adapter that maps RGB patches to infrared patches, enabling unified optimization of cross-modal patches. By learning an optimal color distribution on the adversarial patch, we can manipulate its thermal response and generate an adversarial infrared texture. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale clipping strategy and construct a new visible-infrared dataset, MSDrone, which contains aerial vehicle images in varying scales and perspectives. These data augmentation strategies enhance the robustness of our patch in real-world conditions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (e.g., DroneVehicle, LLVIP, VisDrone, MSDrone) show that our method outperforms existing patch attacks in the digital domain. Extensive physical tests further confirm strong transferability across scales, views, and scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> | None |
