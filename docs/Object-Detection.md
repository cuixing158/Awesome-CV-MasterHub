| **[Beyond the Encoder: Joint Encoder-Decoder Contrastive Pre-Training Improves Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17526v3)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning methods in self-supervised settings have primarily focused on pre-training encoders, while decoders are typically introduced and trained separately for downstream dense prediction tasks. However, this conventional approach overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon, an efficient encoder-decoder self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that supports joint contrastive pre-training. We first extend existing SSL architectures to accommodate diverse decoders and their corresponding contrastive losses. Then, we introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives to enable the joint pre-training of encoder-decoder architectures. By adapting a contrastive SSL framework for dense prediction, DeCon establishes consistent state-of-the-art performance on most of the evaluated tasks when pre-trained on Imagenet-1K, COCO and COCO+. Notably, when pre-training a ResNet-50 encoder on COCO dataset, DeCon improves COCO object detection and instance segmentation compared to the baseline framework by +0.37 AP and +0.32 AP, respectively, and boosts semantic segmentation by +1.42 mIoU on Pascal VOC and by +0.50 mIoU on Cityscapes. These improvements generalize across recent backbones, decoders, datasets, and dense tasks beyond segmentation and object detection, and persist in out-of-domain scenarios, including limited-data settings, demonstrating that joint pre-training significantly enhances representation quality for dense prediction.

| **[Multiple Object Detection and Tracking in Panoramic Videos for Cycling Safety Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15199v3)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyclists face a disproportionate risk of injury, yet conventional crash records are too sparse to identify risk factors at fine spatial and temporal scales. Recently, naturalistic studies have used video data to capture the complex behavioural and infrastructural risk factors. A promising format is panoramic video, which can record 360$^\circ$ views around a rider. However, its use is limited by distortions, large numbers of small objects, and boundary continuity, which cannot be handled using existing computer vision models. This research proposes a novel three-step framework: (1) enhancing object detection accuracy on panoramic imagery by segmenting and projecting the original 360$^\circ$ images into sub-images; (2) modifying multi-object tracking models to incorporate boundary continuity and object category information; and (3) validating through a real-world application of vehicle overtaking detection. The methodology is evaluated using panoramic videos recorded by cyclists on London's roadways under diverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate improvements over baselines, achieving higher average precision across varying image resolutions. Moreover, the enhanced tracking approach yields a 10.0% decrease in identification switches and a 2.7% improvement in identification precision. The overtaking detection task achieves a high F-score of 0.82, illustrating the practical effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world cycling safety scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness and Adversarial Training Strategies for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16494v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Vision and Language: Novel Representations and Artificial intelligence for Driving Scene Safety Assessment and Autonomous Vehicle Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07680v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful representation learning systems that align visual observations with natural language concepts, offering new opportunities for semantic reasoning in safety-critical autonomous driving. This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[How Reliable is Your Service at the Extreme Edge? Analytical Modeling of Computational Reliability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16362v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme Edge Computing (XEC) distributes streaming workloads across consumer-owned devices, exploiting their proximity to users and ubiquitous availability. Many such workloads are AI-driven, requiring continuous neural network inference for tasks like object detection and video analytics. Distributed Inference (DI), which partitions model execution across multiple edge devices, enables these streaming services to meet strict throughput and latency requirements. Yet consumer devices exhibit volatile computational availability due to competing applications and unpredictable usage patterns. This volatility poses a fundamental challenge: how can we quantify the probability that a device, or ensemble of devices, will maintain the processing rate required by a streaming service? This paper presents an analytical framework for computational reliability in XEC, defined as the probability that instantaneous capacity meets demand at a specified Quality of Service (QoS) threshold. We derive closed-form reliability expressions under two information regimes: Minimal Information (MI), requiring only declared operational bounds, and historical data, which refines estimates via Maximum Likelihood Estimation from past observations. The framework extends to multi-device deployments, providing reliability expressions for series, parallel, and partitioned workload configurations. We derive optimal workload allocation rules and analytical bounds for device selection, equipping orchestrators with tractable tools to evaluate deployment feasibility and configure distributed streaming systems. We validate the framework using real-time object detection with YOLO11m model as a representative DI streaming workload; experiments on emulated XED environments demonstrate close agreement between analytical predictions, Monte Carlo sampling, and empirical measurements across diverse capacity and demand configurations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Self-Supervised Approach for Enhanced Feature Representations in Object Detection Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16322v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence, where models are increasingly growing in complexity and size, the availability of labeled data for training deep learning models has become a significant challenge. Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ToaSt: Token Channel Selection and Structured Pruning for Efficient ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15720v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various vision tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs. While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, achieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[A Study on Real-time Object Detection using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15926v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection has compelling applications over a range of domains, including human-computer interfaces, security and video surveillance, navigation and road traffic monitoring, transportation systems, industrial automation healthcare, the world of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), environment monitoring and activity identification. Applications of real time object detection in all these areas provide dynamic analysis of the visual information that helps in immediate decision making. Furthermore, advanced deep learning algorithms leverage the progress in the field of object detection providing more accurate and efficient solutions. There are some outstanding deep learning algorithms for object detection which includes, Faster R CNN(Region-based Convolutional Neural Network),Mask R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector), RetinaNet etc. This article goes into great detail on how deep learning algorithms are used to enhance real time object recognition. It provides information on the different object detection models available, open benchmark datasets, and studies on the use of object detection models in a range of applications. Additionally, controlled studies are provided to compare various strategies and produce some illuminating findings. Last but not least, a number of encouraging challenges and approaches are offered as suggestions for further investigation in both relevant deep learning approaches and object recognition.</p></details> | 34 pages, 18 figures | None |
| **[Synthesizing Trajectory Queries from Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15164v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scientists often need to write programs to process predictions of machine learning models, such as object detections and trajectories in video data. However, writing such queries can be challenging due to the fuzzy nature of real-world data; in particular, they often include real-valued parameters that must be tuned by hand. We propose a novel framework called Quivr that synthesizes trajectory queries matching a given set of examples. To efficiently synthesize parameters, we introduce a novel technique for pruning the parameter space and a novel quantitative semantics that makes this more efficient. We evaluate Quivr on a benchmark of 17 tasks, including several from prior work, and show both that it can synthesize accurate queries for each task and that our optimizations substantially reduce synthesis time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Zero-shot HOI Detection with MLLM-based Detector-agnostic Interaction Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15124v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate humans and objects in images and recognize their interactions. While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining.

| **[Explainability-Inspired Layer-Wise Pruning of Deep Neural Networks for Efficient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14040v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in object detection tasks, but their increasing complexity poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. While model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as essential tools, traditional magnitude-based pruning methods do not necessarily align with the true functional contribution of network components to task-specific performance. In this work, we present an explainability-inspired, layer-wise pruning framework tailored for efficient object detection. Our approach leverages a SHAP-inspired gradient--activation attribution to estimate layer importance, providing a data-driven proxy for functional contribution rather than relying solely on static weight magnitudes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse object detection architectures, including ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOv8, evaluating performance on the Microsoft COCO 2017 validation set. The results show that the proposed attribution-inspired pruning consistently identifies different layers as least important compared to L1-norm-based methods, leading to improved accuracy--efficiency trade-offs. Notably, for ShuffleNetV2, our method yields a 10\% empirical increase in inference speed, whereas L1-pruning degrades performance by 13.7\%. For RetinaNet, the proposed approach preserves the baseline mAP (0.151) with negligible impact on inference speed, while L1-pruning incurs a 1.3\% mAP drop for a 6.2\% speed increase. These findings highlight the importance of data-driven layer importance assessment and demonstrate that explainability-inspired compression offers a principled direction for deploying deep neural networks on edge and resource-constrained platforms while preserving both performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RoboAug: One Annotation to Hundreds of Scenes via Region-Contrastive Data Augmentation for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14032v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the generalization capability of robotic learning to enable robots to operate effectively in diverse, unseen scenes is a fundamental and challenging problem. Existing approaches often depend on pretraining with large-scale data collection, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming, or on semantic data augmentation techniques that necessitate an impractical assumption of flawless upstream object detection in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboAug, a novel generative data augmentation framework that significantly minimizes the reliance on large-scale pretraining and the perfect visual recognition assumption by requiring only the bounding box annotation of a single image during training. Leveraging this minimal information, RoboAug employs pre-trained generative models for precise semantic data augmentation and integrates a plug-and-play region-contrastive loss to help models focus on task-relevant regions, thereby improving generalization and boosting task success rates. We conduct extensive real-world experiments on three robots, namely UR-5e, AgileX, and Tien Kung 2.0, spanning over 35k rollouts. Empirical results demonstrate that RoboAug significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation baselines. Specifically, when evaluating generalization capabilities in unseen scenes featuring diverse combinations of backgrounds, distractors, and lighting conditions, our method achieves substantial gains over the baseline without augmentation. The success rates increase from 0.09 to 0.47 on UR-5e, from 0.16 to 0.60 on AgileX, and from 0.19 to 0.67 on Tien Kung 2.0. These results highlight the superior generalization and effectiveness of RoboAug in real-world manipulation tasks.

| **[Explore Intrinsic Geometry for Query-based Tiny and Oriented Object Detector with Momentum-based Bipartite Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13728v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent query-based detectors have achieved remarkable progress, yet their performance remains constrained when handling objects with arbitrary orientations, especially for tiny objects capturing limited texture information. This limitation primarily stems from the underutilization of intrinsic geometry during pixel-based feature decoding and the occurrence of inter-stage matching inconsistency caused by stage-wise bipartite matching. To tackle these challenges, we present IGOFormer, a novel query-based oriented object detector that explicitly integrates intrinsic geometry into feature decoding and enhances inter-stage matching stability. Specifically, we design an Intrinsic Geometry-aware Decoder, which enhances the object-related features conditioned on an object query by injecting complementary geometric embeddings extrapolated from their correlations to capture the geometric layout of the object, thereby offering a critical geometric insight into its orientation. Meanwhile, a Momentum-based Bipartite Matching scheme is developed to adaptively aggregate historical matching costs by formulating an exponential moving average with query-specific smoothing factors, effectively preventing conflicting supervisory signals arising from inter-stage matching inconsistency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our IGOFormer for aerial oriented object detection, achieving an AP$_{50}$ score of 78.00\% on DOTA-V1.0 using Swin-T backbone under the single-scale setting. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |
| **[Fine-tuned Vision Language Model for Localization of Parasitic Eggs in Microscopic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13712v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections continuously affect a large proportion of the global population, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where access to specialized diagnostic expertise is limited. Although manual microscopic diagnosis of parasitic eggs remains the diagnostic gold standard, the approach can be labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This paper aims to utilize a vision language model (VLM) such as Microsoft Florence that was fine-tuned to localize all parasitic eggs within microscopic images. The preliminary results show that our localization VLM performs comparatively better than the other object detection methods, such as EfficientDet, with an mIOU of 0.94. This finding demonstrates the potential of the proposed VLM to serve as a core component of an automated framework, offering a scalable engineering solution for intelligent parasitological diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LAF-YOLOv10 with Partial Convolution Backbone, Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid, Auxiliary P2 Head, and Wise-IoU Loss for Small Object Detection in Drone Aerial Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13378v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles serve as primary sensing platforms for surveillance, traffic monitoring, and disaster response, making aerial object detection a central problem in applied computer vision. Current detectors struggle with UAV-specific challenges: targets spanning only a few pixels, cluttered backgrounds, heavy occlusion, and strict onboard computational budgets. This study introduces LAF-YOLOv10, built on YOLOv10n, integrating four complementary techniques to improve small-object detection in drone imagery. A Partial Convolution C2f (PC-C2f) module restricts spatial convolution to one quarter of backbone channels, reducing redundant computation while preserving discriminative capacity. An Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid Network (AG-FPN) inserts Squeeze-and-Excitation channel gates before multi-scale fusion and replaces nearest-neighbor upsampling with DySample for content-aware interpolation. An auxiliary P2 detection head at 160$\times$160 resolution extends localization to objects below 8$\times$8 pixels, while the P5 head is removed to redistribute parameters. Wise-IoU v3 replaces CIoU for bounding box regression, attenuating gradients from noisy annotations in crowded aerial scenes. The four modules address non-overlapping bottlenecks: PC-C2f compresses backbone computation, AG-FPN refines cross-scale fusion, the P2 head recovers spatial resolution, and Wise-IoU stabilizes regression under label noise. No individual component is novel; the contribution is the joint integration within a single YOLOv10 framework. Across three training runs (seeds 42, 123, 256), LAF-YOLOv10 achieves 35.1$\pm$0.3\% mAP@0.5 on VisDrone-DET2019 with 2.3\,M parameters, exceeding YOLOv10n by 3.3 points. Cross-dataset evaluation on UAVDT yields 35.8$\pm$0.4\% mAP@0.5. Benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano confirm 24.3 FPS at FP16, demonstrating viability for embedded UAV deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robustness of Object Detection of Autonomous Vehicles in Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12902v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As self-driving technology advances toward widespread adoption, determining safe operational thresholds across varying environmental conditions becomes critical for public safety. This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent research indicates that using VLMs yields better RAG performance, but processing rich documents remains a challenge since a single page contains large amounts of information. In this paper, we present SCAN (SemantiC Document Layout ANalysis), a novel approach that enhances both textual and visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that work with visually rich documents. It is a VLM-friendly approach that identifies document components with appropriate semantic granularity, balancing context preservation with processing efficiency. SCAN uses a coarse-grained semantic approach that divides documents into coherent regions covering contiguous components. We trained the SCAN model by fine-tuning object detection models on an annotated dataset. Our experimental results across English and Japanese datasets demonstrate that applying SCAN improves end-to-end textual RAG performance by up to 9.4 points and visual RAG performance by up to 10.4 points, outperforming conventional approaches and even commercial document processing solutions.</p></details> |  | None |

The system consists of two components: (1) a social navigation framework implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 that integrates real-time RGB-D perception using an OAK-D Lite camera, YOLOv8-based object detection, COMPOSER-based collective activity recognition, D* Lite dynamic path planning, and haptic feedback via vibration motors for tasks such as locating a vacant seat; and (2) an agentic multimodal LLM-VLM interaction framework that integrates speech recognition, vision language models, large language models, and text-to-speech, with dynamic routing between voice-only and vision-only modes to enable natural voice-based communication, scene description, and object localization from visual input. The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions. Group activity recognition further shows robust performance across diverse crowd scenarios. In addition, a preliminary exploratory user study with eight visually impaired and low-vision participants evaluates the agentic interaction framework through structured tasks and a UTAUT-based questionnaire reveals high acceptance and positive perceptions of usability, trust, and perceived sociability during our experiments. The results highlight the potential of PISHYAR as a multimodal assistive mobility aid that extends beyond navigation to provide socially interactive support for such users.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in CP, an ego agent needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-uniGuard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code is available at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-uniGuard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-uniGuard) |

This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Image Zoom-in with Bounding Box Transformation for UAV Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07512v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting objects from UAV-captured images is challenging due to the small object size. In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency.

However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Cameras provide dense visual cues but ill posed depth; LiDAR provides a precise 3D structure but sparse coverage. Existing BEV-based fusion frameworks have made good progress, but they have difficulties including inefficient context modeling, spatially invariant fusion, and reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce MambaFusion, a unified multi-modal detection framework that achieves efficient, adaptive, and physically grounded 3D perception. MambaFusion interleaves selective state-space models (SSMs) with windowed transformers to propagate the global context in linear time while preserving local geometric fidelity. A multi-modal token alignment (MTA) module and reliability-aware fusion gates dynamically re-weight camera-LiDAR features based on spatial confidence and calibration consistency. Finally, a structure-conditioned diffusion head integrates graph-based reasoning with uncertainty-aware denoising, enforcing physical plausibility, and calibrated confidence. MambaFusion establishes new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmarks while operating with linear-time complexity. The framework demonstrates that coupling SSM-based efficiency with reliability-driven fusion yields robust, temporally stable, and interpretable 3D perception for real-world autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Chain-of-Look Spatial Reasoning for Dense Surgical Instrument Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11024v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate counting of surgical instruments in Operating Rooms (OR) is a critical prerequisite for ensuring patient safety during surgery. Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026.

| **[Are Dense Labels Always Necessary for 3D Object Detection from Point Cloud?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02818v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object detection methods often require a large amount of 3D bounding box annotations for training. However, collecting such large-scale densely-supervised datasets is notoriously costly. To reduce the cumbersome data annotation process, we propose a novel sparsely-annotated framework, in which we just annotate one 3D object per scene. Such a sparse annotation strategy could significantly reduce the heavy annotation burden, while inexact and incomplete sparse supervision may severely deteriorate the detection performance. To address this issue, we develop the SS3D++ method that alternatively improves 3D detector training and confident fully-annotated scene generation in a unified learning scheme. Using sparse annotations as seeds, we progressively generate confident fully-annotated scenes based on designing a missing-annotated instance mining module and reliable background mining module. Our proposed method produces competitive results when compared with SOTA weakly-supervised methods using the same or even more annotation costs. Besides, compared with SOTA fully-supervised methods, we achieve on-par or even better performance on the KITTI dataset with about 5x less annotation cost, and 90% of their performance on the Waymo dataset with about 15x less annotation cost. The additional unlabeled training scenes could further boost the performance.</p></details> | update | None |

However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to The Visual Computer</p></details> | None |

However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%. Additionally, we validate the practical feasibility of AurigaNet by deploying it on embedded devices such as the Jetson Orin NX, where it demonstrates competitive real-time performance. These results underscore AurigaNet's potential as a robust and efficient solution for autonomous driving perception systems.

In the transportation sector, object detection is widely used to improve security, for example, in traffic security and passenger crossings at train stations. Some accidents occur in the train crossing area at the station, like passengers uncarefully when passing through the yellow line. So further security needs to be developed. Additional technology is required to reduce the number of accidents. This paper focuses on passenger detection applications at train stations using YOLOX and Edge AI Accelerator hardware. the performance of the AI accelerator will be compared with Jetson Orin Nano.

| **[1%>100%: High-Efficiency Visual Adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10513v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying vision foundation models typically relies on efficient adaptation strategies, whereas conventional full fine-tuning suffers from prohibitive costs and low efficiency. While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models. We release the code on https://github.com/DongshuoYin/CoLin.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/DongshuoYin/CoLin) |
| **[Synthesizing the Kill Chain: A Zero-Shot Framework for Target Verification and Tactical Reasoning on the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13324v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying autonomous edge robotics in dynamic military environments is constrained by both scarce domain-specific training data and the computational limits of edge hardware. This paper introduces a hierarchical, zero-shot framework that cascades lightweight object detection with compact Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from the Qwen and Gemma families (4B-12B parameters). Grounding DINO serves as a high-recall, text-promptable region proposer, and frames with high detection confidence are passed to edge-class VLMs for semantic verification. We evaluate this pipeline on 55 high-fidelity synthetic videos from Battlefield 6 across three tasks: false-positive filtering (up to 100% accuracy), damage assessment (up to 97.5%), and fine-grained vehicle classification (55-90%). We further extend the pipeline into an agentic Scout-Commander workflow, achieving 100% correct asset deployment and a 9.8/10 reasoning score (graded by GPT-4o) with sub-75-second latency. A novel "Controlled Input" methodology decouples perception from reasoning, revealing distinct failure phenotypes: Gemma3-12B excels at tactical logic but fails in visual perception, while Gemma3-4B exhibits reasoning collapse even with accurate inputs. These findings validate hierarchical zero-shot architectures for edge autonomy and provide a diagnostic framework for certifying VLM suitability in safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 3 Figures | None |

We present Sim2Radar, an end-to-end framework that synthesizes training radar data directly from single-view RGB images, enabling scalable data generation without manual scene modeling. Sim2Radar reconstructs a material-aware 3D scene by combining monocular depth estimation, segmentation, and vision-language reasoning to infer object materials, then simulates mmWave propagation with a configurable physics-based ray tracer using Fresnel reflection models parameterized by ITU-R electromagnetic properties. Evaluated on real-world indoor scenes, Sim2Radar improves downstream 3D radar perception via transfer learning: pre-training a radar point-cloud object detection model on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real radar yields up to +3.7 3D AP (IoU 0.3), with gains driven primarily by improved spatial localization. These results suggest that physics-based, vision-driven radar simulation can provide effective geometric priors for radar learning and measurably improve performance under limited real-data supervision.</p></details> |  | None |

The dataset was collected in an outdoor environment, where volunteers used wheelchairs, canes, and walkers, resulting in nine categories of pedestrians: pedestrians, cane users, two types of walker users, whether walking or resting, five types of wheelchair users, including wheelchair users, people pushing empty wheelchairs, and three types of users pushing occupied wheelchairs, including the entire pushing group, the pusher and the person seated on the wheelchair.

| **[Learning to Detect Baked Goods with Limited Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09979v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring leftover products provides valuable insights that can be used to optimize future production. This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BiSSL: Enhancing the Alignment Between Self-Supervised Pretraining and Downstream Fine-Tuning via Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02387v5)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models initialized from self-supervised pretraining may suffer from poor alignment with downstream tasks, reducing the extent to which subsequent fine-tuning can adapt pretrained features toward downstream objectives. To mitigate this, we introduce BiSSL, a novel bilevel training framework that enhances the alignment of self-supervised pretrained models with downstream tasks prior to fine-tuning. BiSSL acts as an intermediate training stage conducted after conventional self-supervised pretraining and is tasked with solving a bilevel optimization problem that incorporates the pretext and downstream training objectives in its lower- and upper-level objectives, respectively. This approach explicitly models the interdependence between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages within the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline, facilitating enhanced information sharing between them that ultimately leads to a model initialization better aligned with the downstream task. We propose a general training algorithm for BiSSL that is compatible with a broad range of pretext and downstream tasks. Using SimCLR and Bootstrap Your Own Latent to pretrain ResNet-50 backbones on the ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves accuracy on the vast majority of 12 downstream image classification datasets, as well as on object detection. Exploratory analyses alongside investigative experiments further provide compelling evidence that BiSSL enhances downstream alignment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Energy-Efficient Fast Object Detection on Edge Devices for IoT Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09515v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) application that utilizes an AI classifier for fast-object detection using the frame difference method. This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures | None |

To address this limitation, we propose ALIGN (Advanced query initialization with LiDAR and Image GuidaNce), a novel approach for occlusion-robust, object-aware query initialization. Our model consists of three key components: (i) Occlusion-aware Center Estimation (OCE), which integrates LiDAR geometry and image semantics to estimate object centers accurately (ii) Adaptive Neighbor Sampling (ANS), which generates object candidates from LiDAR clustering and supplements each object by sampling spatially and semantically aligned points around it and (iii) Dynamic Query Balancing (DQB), which adaptively balances queries between foreground and background regions. Our extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves performance across multiple state-of-the-art detectors, achieving gains of up to +0.9 mAP and +1.2 NDS, particularly in challenging scenes with occlusions or dense crowds. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, it remains unclear whether such attacks are feasible in modern, performance-optimized systems deployed in practice. In this work, we evaluate the practical feasibility of gradient inversion for image-based federated learning. We conduct a systematic study across multiple datasets and tasks, including image classification and object detection, using canonical vision architectures at contemporary resolutions. Our results show that while gradient inversion remains possible for certain legacy or transitional designs under highly restrictive assumptions, modern, performance-optimized models consistently resist meaningful reconstruction visually. We further demonstrate that many reported successes rely on upper-bound settings, such as inference mode operation or architectural simplifications which do not reflect realistic training pipelines. Taken together, our findings indicate that, under an honest-but-curious server assumption, high-fidelity image reconstruction via gradient inversion does not constitute a critical privacy risk in production-optimized federated learning systems, and that practical risk assessments must carefully distinguish diagnostic attack settings from real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: r...</summary><p>v2: revised manuscript; expanded experiments; improved analysis of reconstruction behavior across architectures</p></details> | None |

However, due to differences in viewpoints and spatial positions, agents often acquire heterogeneous observations. Existing intermediate fusion methods primarily focus on aligning similar features, often overlooking the perceptual diversity among agents. To address this limitation, we propose CoBEVMoE, a novel collaborative perception framework that operates in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space and incorporates a Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) architecture. In DMoE, each expert is dynamically generated based on the input features of a specific agent, enabling it to extract distinctive and reliable cues while attending to shared semantics. This design allows the fusion process to explicitly model both feature similarity and heterogeneity across agents. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Expert Metric Loss (DEML) to enhance inter-expert diversity and improve the discriminability of the fused representation. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V and DAIR-V2X-C datasets demonstrate that CoBEVMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, it improves the IoU for Camera-based BEV segmentation by +1.5% on OPV2V and the AP@0.5 for LiDAR-based 3D object detection by +3.0% on DAIR-V2X-C, verifying the effectiveness of expert-based heterogeneous feature modeling in multi-agent collaborative perception.

However, these advancements come with significant demands for memory and computational resources, presenting challenges for hardware deployment. Heterogeneous compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising solution for enabling energy-efficient deployment of ViTs. Despite this potential, monolithic CIM-based designs face scalability issues due to the size limitations of a single chip. To address this challenge, emerging chiplet-based techniques offer a more scalable alternative. However, chiplet designs come with their own costs, as they introduce expensive communication, which can hinder improvements in throughput. This work introduces Hemlet, a heterogeneous CIM chiplet system designed to accelerate ViT workloads. Hemlet enables flexible resource scaling through the integration of heterogeneous analog CIM (ACIM), digital CIM (DCIM), and Intermediate Data Process (IDP) chiplets. To improve throughput while reducing communication overhead, it employs a group-level parallelism (GLP) mapping strategy and system-level dataflow optimization, achieving speedups ranging from 2.41x to 5.74x across various hardware configurations within the chiplet system. Our evaluation results show that Hemlet can reach a throughput of 9.56 TOPS with an energy efficiency of 4.98 TOPS/W.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing multimodal fusion methods suffer from limited capability in discriminative modeling of multi-scale semantic structures and salient target regions, which further restricts the effective fusion of task-related semantic details and target information across modalities. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel fusion network termed TSJNet, which leverages the semantic information output by high-level tasks in a joint manner to guide the fusion process. Specifically, we design a multi-dimensional feature extraction module with dual parallel branches to capture multi-scale and salient features. Meanwhile, a data-agnostic spatial attention module embedded in the decoder dynamically calibrates attention allocation across different data domains, significantly enhancing the model's generalization ability. To optimize both fusion and advanced visual tasks, we balance performance by combining fusion loss with semantic losses. Additionally, we have developed a multimodal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) dataset covering multiple scenarios (UMS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSJNet achieves outstanding performance on five public datasets (MSRS, M\textsuperscript{3}FD, RoadScene, LLVIP, and TNO) and our UMS dataset. The generated fusion results exhibit favorable visual effects, and compared to state-of-the-art methods, the mean average precision (mAP@0.5) and mean intersection over union (mIoU) for object detection and segmentation, respectively, improve by 7.97\% and 10.88\%.The code and the dataset has been publicly released at https://github.com/XylonXu01/TSJNet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/XylonXu01/TSJNet) |

However, the high foreground-background similarity in VCOD limits the discriminability of such features (e.g. color and texture). Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only compensate for appearance limitations, but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in spectral energy. Meanwhile, the emerging state space model called Mamba enables efficient motion perception in frame sequences with its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose Vcamba, a visual camouflage Mamba based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, by analyzing the spatial representations of frequency components, we reveal a structural evolution pattern that emerges from the ordered superposition of components. Based on this observation, we propose a unique frequency-domain sequential scanning (FSS) strategy to unfold the spectrum. Utilizing FSS, the adaptive frequency enhancement (AFE) module employs Mamba to model the causal dependencies within sequences, enabling effective frequency learning. Furthermore, we propose a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and frequency-temporal sequences. Finally, the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain features into unified motion representation. Experiments show that Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets with lower computation cost, confirming its superiority.

We gathered data in mostly urban environments, using "before/after/negative" (BAN) protocol: for a given location, we capture an image with the object present, an image from the same viewpoint after removal, and a nearby negative scene that often contains visually similar confusers. Image collection began in 2020. This paper focuses on two dataset checkpoints from 2025 and 2024. The dataset contains over 9000 images and 6000 polygon annotations. Of the author-captured images we held out 691 for validation and used the rest to train. Via community participation we obtained a 121-image test set that, while small, is independent from author-collected images and provides some generalization confidence across photographers, devices, and locations. Due to its limited size, we report both validation and test results. We explore the difficulty of the dataset using off-the-shelf VIT, MaskRCNN, YOLO-v9, and DINO-v2 models. Zero-shot DINO performs poorly, indicating limited foundational-model coverage of this category. Tuned DINO is the best model with a box-level average precision of 0.69 on a 691-image validation set and 0.7 on the test set. These results establish strong baselines and quantify the remaining difficulty of detecting small, camouflaged waste objects. To support open access to models and data, we compare centralized and decentralized distribution mechanisms and discuss trade-offs for sharing scientific data.

| **[Vision and language: Novel Representations and Artificial intelligence for Driving Scene Safety Assessment and Autonomous Vehicle Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07680v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful representation learning systems that align visual observations with natural language concepts, offering new opportunities for semantic reasoning in safety-critical autonomous driving. This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.</p></details> |  | None |

They spread the fungal-type crayfish plague disease (Aphanomyces astaci) that is lethal to the native white clawed crayfish, the only native crayfish species in Britain. Invasive signal crayfish extensively burrow, causing habitat destruction, erosion of river banks and adverse changes in water quality, while also competing with native species for resources leading to declines in native populations. Moreover, pollution exacerbates the vulnerability of White-clawed crayfish, with their populations declining by over 90%. To safeguard aquatic ecosystems, it is imperative to address the challenges posed by invasive species and pollution in aquatic ecosystem's. This article introduces the Cognitive Edge Device (CED) computing platform for the detection of crayfish and plastic. It also presents two publicly available underwater datasets, annotated with sequences of crayfish and aquatic plastic debris. Four You Only Look Once (YOLO) variants were trained and evaluated for crayfish and plastic object detection. YOLOv5s achieved the highest detection accuracy, with an mAP@0.5 of 0.90, and achieved the best precision</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of 2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6% $\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems.

Models were assessed using precision, recall, mean Average Precision at 50 % Intersection over Union (mAP@50), and computational efficiency across pre-processing, inference, and post-processing stages for detecting immature green fruitlets in commercial orchards. Field-level fruitlet counting was also validated using images captured with both Intel RealSense and iPhone 14 Pro Max sensors. YOLOv12l achieved the highest recall (0.900), while YOLOv10x and YOLOv9 GELAN-c reported the top precision scores of 0.908 and 0.903, respectively. YOLOv9 GELAN-base and GELAN-e achieved the highest mAP@50 (0.935), followed by YOLO11s (0.933) and YOLOv12l (0.931). In counting validation, YOLO11n demonstrated superior accuracy, with RMSE values of 4.51-4.96 and MAE values of 3.85-7.73 across four apple varieties. Sensor-specific training on Intel RealSense further improved detection performance. YOLO11n also recorded the fastest inference speed (2.4 ms), outperforming YOLOv8n, YOLOv9 GELAN-s, YOLOv10n, and YOLOv12n, affirming its suitability for real-time orchard applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing visual language models (VLMs) have very weak capabilities in spatial reasoning due to the lack of knowledge about 3D spatial information, especially when the reasoning task involve complex spatial relations across multiple video frames. In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks. Our basic idea is to integrate fragmented spatial information from multiple frames into a unified space representation of global semantic map, and further guide the VLM's spatial reasoning over the semantic map via a visual prompt. Experiment results show that our technique can greatly enhance the accuracy of cross-frame spatial reasoning on resource-constrained embodied AI devices, over reasoning tasks with diverse types and complexities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Parameters as Experts: Adapting Vision Models with Dynamic Parameter Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06862v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting pre-trained vision models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) remains challenging, as it aims to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning using a minimal number of trainable parameters. When applied to complex dense prediction tasks, existing methods exhibit limitations, including input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations. To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdaRoute on diverse vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

These methods typically comprise two steps: 1) Utilize a region proposal network to propose a handful of high-quality proposals in a bottom-up fashion. 2) Resize and pool the semantic features from the proposed regions to summarize RoI-wise representations for further refinement. Note that these RoI-wise representations in step 2) are considered individually as uncorrelated entries when fed to following detection headers. Nevertheless, we observe these proposals generated by step 1) offset from ground truth somehow, emerging in local neighborhood densely with an underlying probability. Challenges arise in the case where a proposal largely forsakes its boundary information due to coordinate offset while existing networks lack corresponding information compensation mechanism. In this paper, we propose $BADet$ for 3D object detection from point clouds. Specifically, instead of refining each proposal independently as previous works do, we represent each proposal as a node for graph construction within a given cut-off threshold, associating proposals in the form of local neighborhood graph, with boundary correlations of an object being explicitly exploited. Besides, we devise a lightweight Region Feature Aggregation Module to fully exploit voxel-wise, pixel-wise, and point-wise features with expanding receptive fields for more informative RoI-wise representations. We validate BADet both on widely used KITTI Dataset and highly challenging nuScenes Dataset. As of Apr. 17th, 2021, our BADet achieves on par performance on KITTI 3D detection leaderboard and ranks $1^{st}$ on $Moderate$ difficulty of $Car$ category on KITTI BEV detection leaderboard.

To this end, 3D object detection serves as the core basis of perception stack especially for the sake of path planning, motion prediction, and collision avoidance etc. Taking a quick glance at the progress we have made, we attribute challenges to visual appearance recovery in the absence of depth information from images, representation learning from partially occluded unstructured point clouds, and semantic alignments over heterogeneous features from cross modalities. Despite existing efforts, 3D object detection for autonomous driving is still in its infancy. Recently, a large body of literature have been investigated to address this 3D vision task. Nevertheless, few investigations have looked into collecting and structuring this growing knowledge. We therefore aim to fill this gap in a comprehensive survey, encompassing all the main concerns including sensors, datasets, performance metrics and the recent state-of-the-art detection methods, together with their pros and cons. Furthermore, we provide quantitative comparisons with the state of the art. A case study on fifteen selected representative methods is presented, involved with runtime analysis, error analysis, and robustness analysis. Finally, we provide concluding remarks after an in-depth analysis of the surveyed works and identify promising directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is accepted by Pattern Recognition on 14 May 2022</p></details> | None |
| **[Machine Learning for Detection and Severity Estimation of Sweetpotato Weevil Damage in Field and Lab Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06786v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sweetpotato weevils (Cylas spp.) are considered among the most destructive pests impacting sweetpotato production, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional methods for assessing weevil damage, predominantly relying on manual scoring, are labour-intensive, subjective, and often yield inconsistent results. These challenges significantly hinder breeding programs aimed at developing resilient sweetpotato varieties. This study introduces a computer vision-based approach for the automated evaluation of weevil damage in both field and laboratory contexts. In the field settings, we collected data to train classification models to predict root-damage severity levels, achieving a test accuracy of 71.43%. Additionally, we established a laboratory dataset and designed an object detection pipeline employing YOLO12, a leading real-time detection model. This methodology incorporated a two-stage laboratory pipeline that combined root segmentation with a tiling strategy to improve the detectability of small objects. The resulting model demonstrated a mean average precision of 77.7% in identifying minute weevil feeding holes. Our findings indicate that computer vision technologies can provide efficient, objective, and scalable assessment tools that align seamlessly with contemporary breeding workflows. These advancements represent a significant improvement in enhancing phenotyping efficiency within sweetpotato breeding programs and play a crucial role in mitigating the detrimental effects of weevils on food security.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CytoCrowd: A Multi-Annotator Benchmark Dataset for Cytology Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06674v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality annotated datasets are crucial for advancing machine learning in medical image analysis. However, a critical gap exists: most datasets either offer a single, clean ground truth, which hides real-world expert disagreement, or they provide multiple annotations without a separate gold standard for objective evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce CytoCrowd, a new public benchmark for cytology analysis. The dataset features 446 high-resolution images, each with two key components: (1) raw, conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) a separate, high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by a senior expert. This dual structure makes CytoCrowd a versatile resource. It serves as a benchmark for standard computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification, using the ground truth. Simultaneously, it provides a realistic testbed for evaluating annotation aggregation algorithms that must resolve expert disagreements. We provide comprehensive baseline results for both tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the challenges presented by CytoCrowd and establish its value as a resource for developing the next generation of models for medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Optical images offer rich textural details but are often affected by low-light, cloud-obscured, or low-resolution conditions, reducing the detection performance. SAR images are robust to weather, but suffer from speckle noise and limited semantic expressiveness. Optical and SAR images provide complementary advantages, and fusing them can significantly improve the detection accuracy. However, progress in this field is hindered by the lack of large-scale, standardized datasets. To address these challenges, we propose the first comprehensive dataset for optical-SAR fusion object detection, named Multi-resolution, Multi-polarization, Multi-scene, Multi-source SAR dataset (M4-SAR). It contains 112,184 precisely aligned image pairs and nearly one million labeled instances with arbitrary orientations, spanning six key categories. To enable standardized evaluation, we develop a unified benchmarking toolkit that integrates six state-of-the-art multi-source fusion methods. Furthermore, we propose E2E-OSDet, a novel end-to-end multi-source fusion detection framework that mitigates cross-domain discrepancies and establishes a robust baseline for future studies. Extensive experiments on M4-SAR demonstrate that fusing optical and SAR data can improve $mAP$ by 5.7\% over single-source inputs, with particularly significant gains in complex environments.

| **[Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06484v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) has made significant strides, most methods rely on unlabeled target data that is assumed to contain sufficient foreground instances. However, in many practical scenarios (e.g., wildlife monitoring, lesion detection), collecting target domain data with objects of interest is prohibitively costly, whereas background-only data is abundant. This common practical constraint introduces a significant technical challenge: the difficulty of achieving domain alignment when target instances are unavailable, forcing adaptation to rely solely on the target background information. We formulate this challenge as the novel problem of Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection. To tackle this, we propose the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) which pioneers an alignment strategy based on background feature prototypes while simultaneously encouraging consistency in the relationship between the source foreground features and the background features within each domain, enabling robust adaptation even without target instances. To facilitate research, we further curate three specialized benchmarks, including simulative auto-driving detection, wildlife detection, and lung nodule detection. Extensive experiments show that RSCN significantly outperforms existing DAOD methods across all three benchmarks in the instance-free scenario. The code and benchmarks will be released soon.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures | None |

Typical cross-domain few-shot approaches rely on fine-tuning scarce target data, incurring cost and overfitting risks. We instead ask: Can a frozen detector adapt with only one exemplar per class without training? To answer this, we introduce training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection, where detectors must adapt to specialized domains with only one annotated exemplar per class and no weight updates. To tackle this task, we propose LAB-Det, which exploits Language As a domain-invariant Bridge. Instead of adapting visual features, we project each exemplar into a descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector. This linguistic conditioning replaces gradient-based adaptation, enabling robust generalization in data-scarce domains. We evaluate on UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects), two widely adopted benchmarks for data-scarce detection, where object boundaries are often ambiguous, and LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating a single parameter. These results establish linguistic adaptation as an efficient and interpretable alternative to fine-tuning in specialized detection settings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many contemporary models prioritize task performance while neglecting biologically grounded processing pathways. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways. Collectively, these results advance insect computational modelling by providing a generalizable bio-inspired vision model capable of sparse computation across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods predominantly formulate it as an objective prediction task with a single groundtruth segmentation map for each image, which renders the problem under-determined and fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD), where salient regions are predicted by considering not only the visual cues but also the observer-specific factors such as their preferences or intents. As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction. By leveraging multi-modal large language models, we develop an efficient data annotation pipeline and construct the first OC-SOD dataset named OC-SODBench, comprising 33k training, validation and test images with 152k textual prompts and object pairs. Built upon this new dataset, we further design OC-SODAgent, an agentic baseline which performs OC-SOD via a human-like "Perceive-Reflect-Adjust" process. Extensive experiments on our proposed OC-SODBench have justified the effectiveness of our contribution. Through this observer-centric perspective, we aim to bridge the gap between human perception and computational modeling, offering a more realistic and flexible understanding of what makes an object truly "salient."

However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE IV 2026. 8 pages, 3 figures.

Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs.

Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

The dataset provides a realistic and application-relevant testbed for benchmarking these methods in the context of industrial robotics bridging the gap between lab-based research and deployment in real-world manufacturing scenarios. Unlike many previous datasets that focus on household or consumer products or use synthetic, clean tabletop datasets, or objects captured solely in controlled lab environments, IndustryShapes introduces five new object types with challenging properties, also captured in realistic industrial assembly settings. The dataset has diverse complexity, from simple to more challenging scenes, with single and multiple objects, including scenes with multiple instances of the same object and it is organized in two parts: the classic set and the extended set. The classic set includes a total of 4,6k images and 6k annotated poses. The extended set introduces additional data modalities to support the evaluation of model-free and sequence-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, IndustryShapes is the first dataset to offer RGB-D static onboarding sequences. We further evaluate the dataset on a representative set of state-of-the art methods for instance-based and novel object 6D pose estimation, including also object detection, segmentation, showing that there is room for improvement in this domain.

Existing datasets, often limited to light haze, rain, and snow, fail to capture extreme weather conditions. To address this gap, this study introduces the Traffic Surveillance Benchmark for Occluded vehicles under various Weather conditions (TSBOW), a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance occluded vehicle detection across diverse annual weather scenarios.

However, thorough research remains difficult, particularly due to the lack of benchmark datasets. In this study, we propose a high-quality dataset automated cropping and filtering (HQ-ACF) pipeline. This pipeline leverages existing object detection datasets and other unlabeled images to automatically crop and filter high-quality human images. Using this pipeline, we constructed a person-based restoration with sophisticated objects and natural activities (\emph{PERSONA}) dataset, which includes training, validation, and test sets. The dataset significantly surpasses other human-related datasets in both quality and content richness. Finally, we propose \emph{OSDHuman}, a novel one-step diffusion model for human body restoration. Specifically, we propose a high-fidelity image embedder (HFIE) as the prompt generator to better guide the model with low-quality human image information, effectively avoiding misleading prompts. Experimental results show that OSDHuman outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ReGLA}, a series of lightweight hybrid networks, which integrates efficient convolutions for local feature extraction with ReLU-based gated linear attention for global modeling. The design incorporates three key innovations: the Efficient Large Receptive Field (ELRF) module for enhancing convolutional efficiency while preserving a large receptive field; the ReLU Gated Modulated Attention (RGMA) module for maintaining linear complexity while enhancing local feature representation; and a multi-teacher distillation strategy to boost performance on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ReGLA; particularly the ReGLA-M achieves \textbf{80.85\%} Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K at $224px$, with only \textbf{4.98 ms} latency at $512px$. Furthermore, ReGLA outperforms similarly scaled iFormer models in downstream tasks, achieving gains of \textbf{3.1\%} AP on COCO object detection and \textbf{3.6\%} mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for high-resolution visual applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |

One-dimensional vibration signals are first mapped to two-dimensional time-frequency spectrograms using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with Morlet wavelets to enhance transient fault signatures. The diagnosis task is then formulated as object detection on the time-frequency plane, where YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and YOLOv11 are employed to localize fault-relevant regions and classify fault types simultaneously. Experiments on three public benchmarks, including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU), and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), demonstrate strong cross-dataset generalization compared with a representative MCNN-LSTM baseline. In particular, YOLOv11 achieves mAP@0.5 of 99.0% (CWRU), 97.8% (PU), and 99.5% (IMS), while providing region-aware visualization of fault patterns in the time-frequency domain. These results suggest that detection-based inference on CWT spectrograms provides an effective and interpretable complementary approach to conventional global classification for rotating machinery condition monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters</p></details> | None |

This research presents Neural Sentinel, a novel unified approach that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform license plate recognition, state classification, and vehicle attribute extraction through a single forward pass. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the promise of deep learning for automating MFL interpretation, progress toward reliable models has been constrained by the absence of a large-scale public dataset and benchmark, making fair comparison and reproducible evaluation difficult. We introduce \textbf{PipeMFL-240K}, a large-scale, meticulously annotated dataset and benchmark for complex object detection in pipeline MFL pseudo-color images. PipeMFL-240K reflects real-world inspection complexity and poses several unique challenges: (i) an extremely long-tailed distribution over \textbf{12} categories, (ii) a high prevalence of tiny objects that often comprise only a handful of pixels, and (iii) substantial intra-class variability. The dataset contains \textbf{240,320} images and \textbf{191,530} high-quality bounding-box annotations, collected from 11 pipelines spanning approximately \textbf{1,480} km. Extensive experiments are conducted with state-of-the-art object detectors to establish baselines. Results show that modern detectors still struggle with the intrinsic properties of MFL data, highlighting considerable headroom for improvement, while PipeMFL-240K provides a reliable and challenging testbed to drive future research. As the first public dataset and the first benchmark of this scale and scope for pipeline MFL inspection, it provides a critical foundation for efficient pipeline diagnostics as well as maintenance planning and is expected to accelerate algorithmic innovation and reproducible research in MFL-based pipeline integrity assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>A dat...</summary><p>A dataset contains 240,320 pipeline MFL pseudo-color images and 191,530 bounding-box annotations, collected from 11 pipelines spanning approximately 1,480 km</p></details> | None |

To address this, prior approaches augment LiDAR data with depth-completed virtual points derived from RGB images; however, directly incorporating all virtual points leads to increased computational cost and introduces challenges in effectively fusing real and virtual information. We present Point Virtual Transformer (PointViT), a transformer-based 3D object detection framework that jointly reasons over raw LiDAR points and selectively sampled virtual points. The framework examines multiple fusion strategies, ranging from early point-level fusion to BEV-based gated fusion, and analyses their trade-offs in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The fused point cloud is voxelized and encoded using sparse convolutions to form a BEV representation, from which a compact set of high-confidence object queries is initialised and refined through a transformer-based context aggregation module. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark report 91.16% 3D AP, 95.94% BEV AP, and 99.36% AP on the KITTI 2D detection benchmark for the Car class.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  | None |

While the majority of studies on the DT focus on its ``eyes," which is the emerging sensing and perception like object detection and tracking, what really distinguishes the DT from a traditional simulator lies in its ``brain," the prediction and decision making capabilities of extracting patterns and making informed decisions from what has been seen and perceived. In order to add value to urban transportation management, DTs need to be powered by artificial intelligence and complement with low-latency high-bandwidth sensing and networking technologies, in other words, cyberphysical systems. This paper can be a pointer to help researchers and practitioners identify challenges and opportunities for the development of DTs; a bridge to initiate conversations across disciplines; and a road map to exploiting potentials of DTs for diverse urban transportation applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Images were extracted from high-definition videos recorded under controlled conditions and curated to reduce redundancy using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) filtering. An automated face-anonymization step was applied to all videos prior to frame selection. Each image contains polygon annotations for five medically relevant classes: syringe, rubber band, disinfectant wipe, gloves, and training arm. The annotations were exported in a segmentation format compatible with modern object detection frameworks (e.g., YOLOv8), ensuring broad usability. This dataset is partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) subsets and is designed to advance research in medical training automation and human-object interaction. It enables multiple applications, including phlebotomy tool detection, procedural step recognition, workflow analysis, conformance checking, and the development of educational systems that provide structured feedback to medical trainees.

| **[PEPR: Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04583v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which poses a critical challenge for real-world deployment under conditions that differ from the training data. To address this domain generalization challenge, we propose a cross-modal framework under the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm for training a robust, single-modality RGB model. We leverage event cameras as a source of privileged information, available only during training. The two modalities exhibit complementary characteristics: the RGB stream is semantically dense but domain-dependent, whereas the event stream is sparse yet more domain-invariant. Direct feature alignment between them is therefore suboptimal, as it forces the RGB encoder to mimic the sparse event representation, thereby losing semantic detail. To overcome this, we introduce Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), which reframes LUPI as a predictive problem in a shared latent space. Instead of enforcing direct cross-modal alignment, we train the RGB encoder with PEPR to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness. The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive state space context network (ASCNet), which builds upon the state space model mechanism to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we design a Multi-Level Context Module (MLCM), which module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception, allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the Adaptive Patchwise Visual State Space (APVSS) block as the decoder of ASCNet, which integrates our proposed Dynamic Adaptive Granularity Scan (DAGS) and Granularity-aware Propagation Module (GPM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps enhanced by local perception, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing state space model's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  | None |

RAW images preserve unprocessed scene data, enabling models to leverage richer cues for both object detection and object description, capturing fine-grained details, spatial relationships, and contextual information often lost in processed images. To support research in this domain, we introduce RAWDet-7, a large-scale dataset of ~25k training and 7.6k test RAW images collected across diverse cameras, lighting conditions, and environments, densely annotated for seven object categories following MS-COCO and LVIS conventions. In addition, we provide object-level descriptions derived from the corresponding high-resolution sRGB images, facilitating the study of object-level information preservation under RAW image processing and low-bit quantization. The dataset allows evaluation under simulated 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization, reflecting realistic sensor constraints, and provides a benchmark for studying detection performance, description quality & detail, and generalization in low-bit RAW image processing.

This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution.

Existing methods often struggle with topological fragmentation of slender creatures in the deep sea and the subtle feature extraction of transparent organisms. In this paper, we propose DeepTopo-Net, a novel framework that integrates topology-aware modeling with frequency-decoupled perception. To address physical degradation, we design the Water-Conditioned Adaptive Perceptor (WCAP), which employs Riemannian metric tensors to dynamically deform convolutional sampling fields. Furthermore, the Abyssal-Topology Refinement Module (ATRM) is developed to maintain the structural connectivity of spindly targets through skeletal priors. Specifically, we first introduce GBU-UCOD, the first high-resolution (2K) benchmark tailored for marine vertical zonation, filling the data gap for hadal and abyssal zones. Extensive experiments on MAS3K, RMAS, and our proposed GBU-UCOD datasets demonstrate that DeepTopo-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving the morphological integrity of complex underwater patterns.

However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples. Experiments on the COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these tasks place substantial demands on resource-constrained edge devices, making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies, including a novel estimation-based techniques and an innovative greedy selection algorithm, to direct image processing requests to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, comparing against widely used baseline techniques. The evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD, EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by 35% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy compared to accuracy-centric methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing diffusion models often produce low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase. Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

FSOD-VFM integrates three key components: a universal proposal network (UPN) for category-agnostic bounding box generation, SAM2 for accurate mask extraction, and DINOv2 features for efficient adaptation to new object categories. Despite the strong generalization capabilities of foundation models, the bounding boxes generated by UPN often suffer from overfragmentation, covering only partial object regions and leading to numerous small, false-positive proposals rather than accurate, complete object detections. To address this issue, we introduce a novel graph-based confidence reweighting method. In our approach, predicted bounding boxes are modeled as nodes in a directed graph, with graph diffusion operations applied to propagate confidence scores across the network. This reweighting process refines the scores of proposals, assigning higher confidence to whole objects and lower confidence to local, fragmented parts. This strategy improves detection granularity and effectively reduces the occurrence of false-positive bounding box proposals. Through extensive experiments on Pascal-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$, and CD-FSOD datasets, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance without requiring additional training. Notably, on the challenging CD-FSOD dataset, which spans multiple datasets and domains, our FSOD-VFM achieves 31.6 AP in the 10-shot setting, substantially outperforming previous training-free methods that reach only 21.4 AP.

In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

We present a camera-free 2D LiDAR object detection pipeline that encodes short-term temporal context by stacking three consecutive scans as RGB channels, yielding a compact YOLOv8n input without occupancy-grid construction while preserving angular structure and motion cues. Evaluated in Webots across 160 randomized indoor scenarios with strict scenario-level holdout, the method achieves 98.4% mAP@0.5 (0.778 mAP@0.5:0.95) with 94.9% precision and 94.7% recall on four object classes. On a Raspberry Pi 5, it runs in real time with a mean post-warm-up end-to-end latency of 47.8ms per frame, including scan encoding and postprocessing. Relative to a closely related occupancy-grid LiDAR-YOLO pipeline reported on the same platform, the proposed representation is associated with substantially lower reported end-to-end latency. Although results are simulation-based, they suggest that lightweight temporal encoding can enable accurate and real-time LiDAR-only detection for embedded indoor robotics without capturing RGB appearance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE SAS 2026</p></details> | None |

However, extracting consistent and fine-grained change information from historical map series remains challenging due to spatial misalignment, cartographic variation, and degrading document quality, limiting most analyses to small-scale or qualitative approaches. We propose a fully automated, deep learning-based framework for fine-grained urban change analysis from large collections of historical maps, built on a modular design that integrates dense map alignment, multi-temporal object detection, and change profiling. This framework shifts the analysis of historical maps from ad hoc visual comparison toward systematic, quantitative characterization of urban change. Experiments demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed alignment and object detection methods. Applied to Paris between 1868 and 1937, the framework reveals the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in urban transformation, highlighting its relevance for research in the social sciences and humanities.

In practice, this assumption often breaks down in remote sensing scenarios due to task- and application-specific category semantics, resulting in unstable category specification under open-vocabulary settings. To address this limitation, we propose RS-MPOD, a multimodal open-vocabulary detection framework that reformulates category specification beyond text-only prompting by incorporating instance-grounded visual prompts, textual prompts, and their multimodal integration. RS-MPOD introduces a visual prompt encoder to extract appearance-based category cues from exemplar instances, enabling text-free category specification, and a multimodal fusion module to integrate visual and textual information when both modalities are available. Extensive experiments on standard, cross-dataset, and fine-grained remote sensing benchmarks show that visual prompting yields more reliable category specification under semantic ambiguity and distribution shifts, while multimodal prompting provides a flexible alternative that remains competitive when textual semantics are well aligned.</p></details> |  | None |

GEO-Bench-2 addresses this with a comprehensive framework spanning classification, segmentation, regression, object detection, and instance segmentation across 19 permissively-licensed datasets. We introduce ''capability'' groups to rank models on datasets that share common characteristics (e.g., resolution, bands, temporality). This enables users to identify which models excel in each capability and determine which areas need improvement in future work. To support both fair comparison and methodological innovation, we define a prescriptive yet flexible evaluation protocol. This not only ensures consistency in benchmarking but also facilitates research into model adaptation strategies, a key and open challenge in advancing GeoFMs for downstream tasks. Our experiments show that no single model dominates across all tasks, confirming the specificity of the choices made during architecture design and pretraining. While models pretrained on natural images (ConvNext ImageNet, DINO V3) excel on high-resolution tasks, EO-specific models (TerraMind, Prithvi, and Clay) outperform them on multispectral applications such as agriculture and disaster response. These findings demonstrate that optimal model choice depends on task requirements, data modalities, and constraints. This shows that the goal of a single GeoFM model that performs well across all tasks remains open for future research. GEO-Bench-2 enables informed, reproducible GeoFM evaluation tailored to specific use cases. Code, data, and leaderboard for GEO-Bench-2 are publicly released under a permissive license.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Physics-Based Benchmarking Metrics for Multimodal Synthetic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15204v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state of the art measures like BLEU, CIDEr, VQA score, SigLIP-2 and CLIPScore are often unable to capture semantic or structural accuracy, especially for domain-specific or context-dependent scenarios. For this, this paper proposes a Physics-Constrained Multimodal Data Evaluation (PCMDE) metric combining large language models with reasoning, knowledge based mapping and vision-language models to overcome these limitations. The architecture is comprised of three main stages: (1) feature extraction of spatial and semantic information with multimodal features through object detection and VLMs; (2) Confidence-Weighted Component Fusion for adaptive component-level validation; and (3) physics-guided reasoning using large language models for structural and relational constraints (e.g., alignment, position, consistency) enforcement.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Samba+: General and Accurate Salient Object Detection via A More Unified Mamba-based Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01593v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing salient object detection (SOD) models are generally constrained by the limited receptive fields of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and quadratic computational complexity of Transformers. Recently, the emerging state-space model, namely Mamba, has shown great potential in balancing global receptive fields and computational efficiency. As a solution, we propose Saliency Mamba (Samba), a pure Mamba-based architecture that flexibly handles various distinct SOD tasks, including RGB/RGB-D/RGB-T SOD, video SOD (VSOD), RGB-D VSOD, and visible-depth-thermal SOD. Specifically, we rethink the scanning strategy of Mamba for SOD, and introduce a saliency-guided Mamba block (SGMB) that features a spatial neighborhood scanning (SNS) algorithm to preserve the spatial continuity of salient regions. A context-aware upsampling (CAU) method is also proposed to promote hierarchical feature alignment and aggregation by modeling contextual dependencies. As one step further, to avoid the "task-specific" problem as in previous SOD solutions, we develop Samba+, which is empowered by training Samba in a multi-task joint manner, leading to a more unified and versatile model. Two crucial components that collaboratively tackle challenges encountered in input of arbitrary modalities and continual adaptation are investigated. Specifically, a hub-and-spoke graph attention (HGA) module facilitates adaptive cross-modal interactive fusion, and a modality-anchored continual learning (MACL) strategy alleviates inter-modal conflicts together with catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Samba individually outperforms existing methods across six SOD tasks on 22 datasets with lower computational cost, whereas Samba+ achieves even superior results on these tasks and datasets by using a single trained versatile model. Additional results further demonstrate the potential of our Samba framework.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper tackles this challenge as a semantic identification task from the road scenes captured by a vehicle's front-view camera. Specifically, the collocation of gaze points with object semantics is investigated using three distinct vision-based approaches: direct object detection (YOLOv13), segmentation-assisted classification (SAM2 paired with EfficientNetV2 versus YOLOv13), and query-based Vision-Language Models, VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL-7b versus Qwen2.5-VL-32b). The results demonstrate that the direct object detection (YOLOv13) and Qwen2.5-VL-32b significantly outperform other approaches, achieving Macro F1-Scores over 0.84. The large VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32b), in particular, exhibited superior robustness and performance for identifying small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights, especially in adverse nighttime conditions. Conversely, the segmentation-assisted paradigm suffers from a "part-versus-whole" semantic gap that led to large failure in recall. The results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the real-time efficiency of traditional detectors and the richer contextual understanding and robustness offered by large VLMs. These findings provide critical insights and practical guidance for the design of future human-aware intelligent driver monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Unified ROI-based Image Compression Paradigm with Generalized Gaussian Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01325v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Region-of-Interest (ROI)-based image compression allocates bits unevenly according to the semantic importance of different regions. Such differentiated coding typically induces a sharp-peaked and heavy-tailed distribution. This distribution characteristic mathematically necessitates a probability model with adaptable shape parameters for accurate description. However, existing methods commonly use a Gaussian model to fit this distribution, resulting in a loss of coding performance. To systematically analyze the impact of this distribution on ROI coding, we develop a unified rate-distortion optimization theoretical paradigm. Building on this paradigm, we propose a novel Generalized Gaussian Model (GGM) to achieve flexible modeling of the latent variables distribution. To support stable optimization of GGM, we introduce effective differentiable functions and further propose a dynamic lower bound to alleviate train-test mismatch. Moreover, finite differences are introduced to solve the gradient computation after GGM fits the distribution. Experiments on COCO2017 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art in both ROI reconstruction and downstream tasks (e.g., Segmentation, Object Detection). Furthermore, compared to classical probability models, our GGM provides a more precise fit to feature distributions and achieves superior coding performance.

Inspired by this principle, we address Context-Entangled Content Segmentation (CECS), a challenging setting where objects share intrinsic visual patterns with their surroundings, as in camouflaged object detection. Conventional segmentation networks predominantly rely on architectural enhancements but often ignore the learning dynamics that govern robustness under entangled data distributions. We introduce CurriSeg, a dual-phase learning framework that unifies curriculum and anti-curriculum principles to improve representation reliability. In the Curriculum Selection phase, CurriSeg dynamically selects training data based on the temporal statistics of sample losses, distinguishing hard-but-informative samples from noisy or ambiguous ones, thus enabling stable capability enhancement. In the Anti-Curriculum Promotion phase, we design Spectral-Blindness Fine-Tuning, which suppresses high-frequency components to enforce dependence on low-frequency structural and contextual cues and thus strengthens generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CurriSeg achieves consistent improvements across diverse CECS benchmarks without adding parameters or increasing total training time, offering a principled view of how progression and challenge interplay to foster robust and context-aware segmentation. Code will be released.</p></details> | 8 figures, 11 tables | None |
| **[Weakly-supervised Contrastive Learning with Quantity Prompts for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02454v2)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection, non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully-supervised ones.</p></details> | Accepted by TGRS 25 | None |

In this paper, we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment (PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences: 66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>19pag...</summary><p>19pages, 5figures, 6tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Open-Vocabulary Object Detection through Multi-Level Fine-Grained Visual-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00531v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional object detection systems are typically constrained to predefined categories, limiting their applicability in dynamic environments. In contrast, open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables the identification of objects from novel classes not present in the training set. Recent advances in visual-language modeling have led to significant progress of OVD. However, prior works face challenges in either adapting the single-scale image backbone from CLIP to the detection framework or ensuring robust visual-language alignment. We propose Visual-Language Detection (VLDet), a novel framework that revamps feature pyramid for fine-grained visual-language alignment, leading to improved OVD performance. With the VL-PUB module, VLDet effectively exploits the visual-language knowledge from CLIP and adapts the backbone for object detection through feature pyramid. In addition, we introduce the SigRPN block, which incorporates a sigmoid-based anchor-text contrastive alignment loss to improve detection of novel categories. Through extensive experiments, our approach achieves 58.7 AP for novel classes on COCO2017 and 24.8 AP on LVIS, surpassing all state-of-the-art methods and achieving significant improvements of 27.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Furthermore, VLDet also demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on closed-set object detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Instance Temperature Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00115v5)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) enhances the performance of a student network by allowing it to learn the knowledge transferred from a teacher network incrementally. Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable the student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different learning stages of KD. KD is a continuous process, but when adjusting the temperature, these methods consider only the immediate benefits of the operation in the current learning phase and fail to take into account its future returns. To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of temperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on reinforcement learning, termed RLKD. Importantly, we design a novel state representation to enable the agent to make more informed action (i.e. instance temperature adjustment). To handle the problem of delayed rewards in our method due to the KD setting, we explore an instance reward calibration approach. In addition,we devise an efficient exploration strategy that enables the agent to learn valuable instance temperature adjustment policy more efficiently. Our framework can serve as a plug-and-play technique to be inserted into various KD methods easily, and we validate its effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks.

Despite its popularity, its ability to preserve model correctness has not been systematically evaluated. We present DiTOX, an automated framework for comprehensively assessing the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer using differential testing, fault localization, and evaluation techniques that generalize to other compiler optimizers. DiTOX applies optimization passes to a corpus of ONNX models, executes both original and optimized versions on user-defined inputs, and detects discrepancies in behavior or optimizer failures. When divergences are observed, DiTOX isolates the responsible optimization pass through iterative, fine-grained analysis. We evaluated DiTOX on 130 models from the ONNX Model Hub spanning vision and language tasks. We found that 9.2% of model instances crashed the optimizer or produced invalid models under default settings. Moreover, output discrepancies occurred in 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models, while text-based models were largely robust. Overall, DiTOX uncovered 15 issues -- 14 previously unknown -- affecting 9 of the 47 optimization passes as well as the optimizer infrastructure. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer developers. Our results demonstrate that DiTOX provides a simple and effective approach for validating AI model optimizers and is readily extensible beyond ONNX.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient Transformer Encoders for Mask2Former-style models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15244v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformer based models bring significant improvements for image segmentation tasks. Although these architectures offer powerful capabilities irrespective of specific segmentation tasks, their use of computational resources can be taxing on deployed devices. One way to overcome this challenge is by adapting the computation level to the specific needs of the input image rather than the current one-size-fits-all approach. To this end, we introduce ECO-M2F or EffiCient TransfOrmer Encoders for Mask2Former-style models. Noting that the encoder module of M2F-style models incur high resource-intensive computations, ECO-M2F provides a strategy to self-select the number of hidden layers in the encoder, conditioned on the input image. To enable this self-selection ability for providing a balance between performance and computational efficiency, we present a three step recipe. The first step is to train the parent architecture to enable early exiting from the encoder. The second step is to create an derived dataset of the ideal number of encoder layers required for each training example. The third step is to use the aforementioned derived dataset to train a gating network that predicts the number of encoder layers to be used, conditioned on the input image. Additionally, to change the computational-accuracy tradeoff, only steps two and three need to be repeated which significantly reduces retraining time. Experiments on the public datasets show that the proposed approach reduces expected encoder computational cost while maintaining performance, adapts to various user compute resources, is flexible in architecture configurations, and can be extended beyond the segmentation task to object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026 WVAQ</p></details> | None |

It enables the vehicle to perceive and understand its environment by identifying and locating various objects around it. By utilizing advanced imaging and deep learning techniques, autonomous vehicle systems can rapidly and accurately identify objects based on their features. Different deep learning methods vary in their ability to accurately detect and classify objects in autonomous vehicle systems. Selecting the appropriate method significantly impacts system performance, robustness, and efficiency in real-world driving scenarios. While several generic deep learning architectures like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN have been proposed, guidance on their suitability for specific autonomous driving applications is often limited. The choice of method affects detection accuracy, processing speed, environmental robustness, sensor integration, scalability, and edge case handling. This study provides a comprehensive experimental analysis comparing two prominent object detection models: YOLOv5 (a one-stage detector) and Faster R-CNN (a two-stage detector). Their performance is evaluated on a diverse dataset combining real and synthetic images, considering various metrics including mean Average Precision (mAP), recall, and inference speed. The findings reveal that YOLOv5 demonstrates superior performance in terms of mAP, recall, and training efficiency, particularly as dataset size and image resolution increase. However, Faster R-CNN shows advantages in detecting small, distant objects and performs well in challenging lighting conditions. The models' behavior is also analyzed under different confidence thresholds and in various real-world scenarios, providing insights into their applicability for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we experiment with finding the sentiments of image and text data, individually and in combination, on two datasets. Part of the approach introduces the novel `Textual-Cues for Enhancing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis' (TEMSA) based on object recognition methods to address the difficulties in multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, we extract the names of all objects detected in an image and combine them with associated text; we call this combination of text and image data TEMS. Our results demonstrate that only TEMS improves the results when considering all the object names for the overall sentiment of multimodal data compared to individual analysis. This research contributes to advancing multimodal sentiment analysis and offers insights into the efficacy of TEMSA in combining image and text data for multimodal sentiment analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

While end-to-end methods have gained significant interest in single-camera tracking, multi-camera tracking remains predominantly reliant on heuristic techniques. In response to this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Camera Tracking tRansformer (MCTR), a novel end-to-end approach tailored for multi-object detection and tracking across multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view. MCTR leverages end-to-end detectors like DEtector TRansformer (DETR) to produce detections and detection embeddings independently for each camera view. The framework maintains set of track embeddings that encaplusate global information about the tracked objects, and updates them at every frame by integrating the local information from the view-specific detection embeddings. The track embeddings are probabilistically associated with detections in every camera view and frame to generate consistent object tracks. The soft probabilistic association facilitates the design of differentiable losses that enable end-to-end training of the entire system. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on MMPTrack and AI City Challenge, two recently introduced large-scale multi-camera multi-object tracking datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real-time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM.

Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks.

While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE VR 2026: GenAI-XR workshop</p></details> | None |

Accurate calibration is a prerequisite for reliable perception and planning tasks such as object detection and obstacle avoidance. Many existing LiDAR calibration methods require overlapping fields of view, while others use external sensing devices or postulate a feature-rich environment. In addition, Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration is not supported by the vast majority of calibration algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel target-based technique for extrinsic Sensor-to-Sensor and Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration of multi-LiDAR systems called CaLiV. This algorithm works for non-overlapping fields of view and does not require any external sensing devices. First, we apply motion to produce field of view overlaps and utilize a simple Unscented Kalman Filter to obtain vehicle poses. Then, we use the Gaussian mixture model-based registration framework GMMCalib to align the point clouds in a common calibration frame. Finally, we reduce the task of recovering the sensor extrinsics to a minimization problem. We show that both translational and rotational Sensor-to-Sensor errors can be solved accurately by our method. In addition, all Sensor-to-Vehicle rotation angles can also be calibrated with high accuracy. We validate the simulation results in real-world experiments. The code is open-source and available on https://github.com/TUMFTM/CaLiV.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TUMFTM/CaLiV) |

However, label errors often compromise the quality of these datasets and affect the outcomes of training and benchmark evaluations. Although label error detection methods for object detection datasets now exist, they are typically validated only on synthetic benchmarks or via limited manual inspection. How to correct such errors systematically and at scale remains an open problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label error correction called Rechecked. Building on existing label error detection methods, their error proposals are reviewed with lightweight, crowd-sourced microtasks. We apply Rechecked to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset, for which we crowdsourced high-quality corrected annotations. We detect 18% of missing and inaccurate labels in the original ground truth. We show that current label error detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover hundreds of errors with little human effort compared to annotation from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the label errors, which motivates further research, now enabled by our released benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of semantic reasoning versus geometric regression, supporting the use of LVLMs as high-level safety validators in SOTIF-oriented automated driving systems.</p></details> | 6 pages, 11 figures | None |

Under practical imaging conditions, object detection systems often face challenges such as large scale variations caused by varying camera distances, severe occlusion from plant structures, and highly imbalanced class distributions. These factors make conventional object detection approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets difficult to simultaneously achieve high detection accuracy and deployment efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes an active learning driven lightweight object detection framework, integrating data analysis, model design, and training strategy. First, the size distribution of objects in raw agricultural images is analyzed to redefine an operational target range, thereby improving learning stability under real-world conditions. Second, an efficient feature extraction module is incorporated to reduce computational cost, while a lightweight attention mechanism is introduced to enhance feature representation under multi-scale and occluded scenarios. Finally, an active learning strategy is employed to iteratively select high-information samples for annotation and training under a limited labeling budget, effectively improving the recognition performance of minority and small-object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that, while maintaining a low parameter count and inference cost suitable for edge-device deployment, the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of tomatoes and tomato flowers in raw images. Under limited annotation conditions, the framework achieves an overall detection accuracy of 67.8% mAP, validating its practicality and feasibility for intelligent agricultural applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OOVDet: Low-Density Prior Learning for Zero-Shot Out-of-Vocabulary Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22685v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot out-of-vocabulary detection (ZS-OOVD) aims to accurately recognize objects of in-vocabulary (IV) categories provided at zero-shot inference, while simultaneously rejecting undefined ones (out-of-vocabulary, OOV) that lack corresponding category prompts. However, previous methods are prone to overfitting the IV classes, leading to the OOV or undefined classes being misclassified as IV ones with a high confidence score. To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot OOV detector (OOVDet), a novel framework that effectively detects predefined classes while reliably rejecting undefined ones in zero-shot scenes. Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes.

While previous methods address unified training across multiple datasets, they fail to model geometric relationships in sparse point cloud scenes and ignore the feature distribution in significant areas, which ultimately restricts their performance. To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement. Then, to further enhance point cloud feature representation, we propose a dynamic channel gating mechanism that leverages learnable channel-wise weighting. This mechanism adaptively optimizes features generated by the sparse 3D U-Net network, significantly enhancing key geometric information. Extensive experiments on six different indoor scene datasets clearly validate the superior performance of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications. We evaluated the attack using RF recordings and OTA experiments with four types of drones. Our results show that modest, structured I/Q perturbations are compatible with standard RF chains and reliably reduce target drone detection while preserving detection of legitimate drones.</p></details> |  | None |

We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 27 Figures, This work has been accepted for publication by the IEEE Sensors Journal.

However, there are two challenges which need to be faced. First, the 4-D radar point clouds are sparse, leading to poor 3-D representation. Second, vision datas exhibit representation degradation under low-light, long distance detection and dense occlusion scenes, which provides unreliable texture information during fusion stage. To address these issues, a framework named SDCM is proposed, which contains Simulated Densifying and Compensatory Modeling Fusion for radar-vision 3-D object detection in IoV. Firstly, considering point generation based on Gaussian simulation of key points obtained from 3-D Kernel Density Estimation (3-D KDE), and outline generation based on curvature simulation, Simulated Densifying (SimDen) module is designed to generate dense radar point clouds. Secondly, considering that radar data could provide more real time information than vision data, due to the all-weather property of 4-D radar. Radar Compensatory Mapping (RCM) module is designed to reduce the affects of vision datas' representation degradation. Thirdly, considering that feature tensor difference values contain the effective information of every modality, which could be extracted and modeled for heterogeneity reduction and modalities interaction, Mamba Modeling Interactive Fusion (MMIF) module is designed for reducing heterogeneous and achieving interactive Fusion. Experiment results on the VoD, TJ4DRadSet and Astyx HiRes 2019 dataset show that SDCM achieves best performance with lower parameter quantity and faster inference speed.

Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |

Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BadDet+: Robust Backdoor Attacks for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21066v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep learning, yet their impact on object detection remains poorly understood compared to image classification. While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.</p></details> |  | None |

They spread the fungal-type crayfish plague disease (Aphanomyces astaci) that is lethal to the native white clawed crayfish, the only native crayfish species in Britain. Invasive signal crayfish extensively burrow, causing habitat destruction, erosion of river banks and adverse changes in water quality, while also competing with native species for resources leading to declines in native populations. Moreover, pollution exacerbates the vulnerability of White-clawed crayfish, with their populations declining by over 90%. To safeguard aquatic ecosystems, it is imperative to address the challenges posed by invasive species and pollution in aquatic ecosystem's.

Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM.

Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands. This optical signal is further enhanced using a neural network. Our learned split-spectrum metalens achieves broadband and obstruction-free imaging with relative PSNR gains of 32.29% and improves object detection and semantic segmentation accuracies with absolute gains of +13.54% mAP, +48.45% IoU, and +20.35% mIoU over a conventional hyperbolic design. This promises robust obstruction-free sensing and vision for space-constrained systems, such as mobile robots, drones, and endoscopes.</p></details> |  | None |

Automotive Mediated Reality (AMR) can enhance driving safety by overlaying critical information (e.g., outlines, icons, text) on key objects to improve awareness, altering objects' appearance to simplify traffic situations, and diminishing their appearance to minimize distractions. However, real-world AMR evaluation remains limited due to technical challenges. To fill this sim-to-real gap, we present MIRAGE, an open-source tool that enables real-time AMR in real vehicles. MIRAGE implements 15 effects across the AMR spectrum of augmented, diminished, and modified reality using state-of-the-art computational models for object detection and segmentation, depth estimation, and inpainting. In an on-road expert user study (N=9) of MIRAGE, participants enjoyed the AMR experience while pointing out technical limitations and identifying use cases for AMR.

However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.</p></details> | Accepted to IPMV2026 | None |
| **[Implicit Non-Causal Factors are Out via Dataset Splitting for Domain Generalization Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19127v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open world object detection faces a significant challenge in domain-invariant representation, i.e., implicit non-causal factors. Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL. Comparative experiments on numerous benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better generalization performance in novel circumstances.</p></details> | To appear in IJCV | None |

Recent vision-language and multimodal models further extend these capabilities by incorporating auxiliary information, including captions, question and answer pairs, and metadata, which broadens applications beyond conventional computer vision tasks. However, these models are typically optimized for semantic alignment between visual and textual content rather than geospatial understanding, and therefore are not suited for representing or reasoning with structured geospatial layers. In this study, we propose a novel model that enhances remote sensing imagery processing with guidance from auxiliary geospatial information. Our approach introduces a geospatial embedding mechanism that transforms diverse geospatial data into embedding patches that are spatially aligned with image patches. To facilitate cross-modal interaction, we design a guided attention module that dynamically integrates multimodal information by computing attention weights based on correlations with auxiliary data, thereby directing the model toward the most relevant regions. In addition, the module assigns distinct roles to individual attention heads, allowing the model to capture complementary aspects of the guidance information and improving the interpretability of its predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing pretrained geospatial foundation models in predicting disease prevalence, highlighting its effectiveness in multimodal geospatial understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</p></details> | None |

These fundamental problems in computer vision are powered by large-scale, painstakingly annotated datasets. Despite their impact, these datasets are costly to build, biased in coverage, and difficult to scale. Synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative but struggle with flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity. We introduce Synthetic Object Compositions (SOC), an accurate and scalable data synthesis pipeline via a novel object-centric composition strategy. It composes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation and camera configuration augmentation with generative harmonization and mask-area-weighted blending, yielding accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on just 100K of our synthetic images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) and synthetic pipelines (Copy-Paste, X-Paste, SynGround, SegGen) by +24-36% -- achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO. Beyond the general open-vocabulary setup, SOC also enables controllable dataset construction for different use cases and boosts performance in both low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments delivers strong performance across different real-data scales and yields even greater improvements under extremely limited real-data conditions, including +6.59 AP on a 1% COCO data setup. Furthermore, this controllability enables targeted data generation for intra-class referring, a diagnostic grounding task we propose that requires fine-grained attribute discrimination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/weikaih04/Synthetic-Detection-Segmentation-Grounding-Data</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/weikaih04/Synthetic-Detection-Segmentation-Grounding-Data) |

However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods underutilize frequency information and rely on static convolutional operations, which constrain the capacity to obtain rich feature representations and hinder the effective exploitation of deep semantic features. To address these issues, we propose EFSI-DETR, a novel detection framework that integrates efficient semantic feature enhancement with dynamic frequency-spatial guidance. EFSI-DETR comprises two main components: (1) a Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Unified Synergy Network (DyFusNet) that jointly exploits frequency and spatial cues for robust multi-scale feature fusion, (2) an Efficient Semantic Feature Concentrator (ESFC) that enables deep semantic extraction with minimal computational cost. Furthermore, a Fine-grained Feature Retention (FFR) strategy is adopted to incorporate spatially rich shallow features during fusion to preserve fine-grained details, crucial for small object detection in UAV imagery. Extensive experiments on VisDrone and CODrone benchmarks demonstrate that our EFSI-DETR achieves the state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency, yielding improvement of \textbf{1.6}\% and \textbf{5.8}\% in AP and AP$_{s}$ on VisDrone, while obtaining \textbf{188} FPS inference speed on a single RTX 4090 GPU.</p></details> |  | None |

While numerous defogging methods exist, from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models, improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, raising concerns about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of defogging pipelines, including classical dehazing filters, modern defogging networks, chained variants combining filters and models, and prompt-driven visual language image editing models applied directly to foggy images. To bridge the gap between simulated and physical environments, we evaluate these pipelines on both the synthetic Foggy Cityscapes dataset and the real-world Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We examine generalization by evaluating performance on synthetic fog and real-world conditions, assessing both image quality and downstream perception in terms of object detection mean average precision and segmentation panoptic quality. Our analysis identifies when defogging is effective, the impact of combining models, and how visual language models compare to traditional approaches. We additionally report qualitative rubric-based evaluations from both human and visual language model judges and analyze their alignment with downstream task metrics. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and identify the conditions under which pre-processing meaningfully improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.

However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats.</p></details> |  | None |

The DSO decouples object features by jointly modeling the channel-wise mean and the peak-to-mean difference. Building upon the DSO, we design two lightweight gating modules: the Dual-Statistic Synergy Gating (DSG) module for adaptive channel-wise feature selection, and the Multi-Path Segmented Gating (MSG) module for depth-wise feature weighting. On the MS-COCO benchmark, YOLO-DS consistently outperforms YOLOv8 across five model scales (N, S, M, L, X), achieving AP gains of 1.1% to 1.7% with only a minimal increase in inference latency. Extensive visualization, ablation, and comparative studies validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superior capability in discriminating heterogeneous objects with high efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross-Level Sensor Fusion with Object Lists via Transformer for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12884v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In automotive sensor fusion systems, smart sensors and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) modules are commonly utilized. Sensor data from these systems are typically available only as processed object lists rather than raw sensor data from traditional sensors. Instead of processing other raw data separately and then fusing them at the object level, we propose an end-to-end cross-level fusion concept with Transformer, which integrates highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection. Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset. It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at IV2025</p></details> | None |

While foundational architectures like transformers and diffusion models have advanced the field, their computational complexity limits their deployment on edge devices. We introduce ExpoMamba, a novel architecture that integrates a frequency-aware state-space model within a modified U-Net. ExpoMamba is designed to address mixed-exposure challenges by decoupling the modeling of amplitude (intensity) and phase (structure) in the frequency domain. This allows for targeted enhancement, making it highly effective for real-time applications, including downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ExpoMamba is up to 2-3x faster than competing models and achieves a 6.8\% PSNR improvement, establishing a new state-of-the-art in efficient, high-quality low-light enhancement.

The core innovation is a robust ground-plane homography estimation that links fixed traffic camera views to satellite orthoimagery. This process rectifies the camera's oblique perspective, ensuring that pixel distances accurately represent real-world distances. This enables the acquisition of features such as vehicle trajectory, speed, deceleration, and braking severity without the need for camera calibration. The pipeline employs the MAGSAC++ estimator to build the homography, converting YOLO11 object detections into a rectified top-down coordinate system. All detection and trajectory data are stored in a ClickHouse database for subsequent analysis. A real-world case study at two signalized intersections in Key West, Florida, showcased the system's capabilities. Across two days of daytime footage, braking activity at the higher-volume intersection peaked around 4 PM at approximately 57.5 events per hour, while the second intersection peaked around 10 AM at roughly 15.5 events per hour. The spatial analysis revealed that most braking events initiated upstream, with mild and moderate braking mostly occurring 30 to 45+ meters away from the stop bar and severe braking distributed throughout, but particularly concentrated in lanes with higher interaction and merging activity. The findings highlight the significant potential of this centralized safety information system to support connected vehicles, facilitating proactive traffic management, crash mitigation, and data-driven roadway design and safety analysis.</p></details> | VEHITS 2026 | None |
| **[Exploiting Unlabeled Data with Multiple Expert Teachers for Open Vocabulary Aerial Object Detection and Its Orientation Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02057v2)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, aerial object detection has been increasingly pivotal in various earth observation applications. However, current algorithms are limited to detecting a set of pre-defined object categories, demanding sufficient annotated training samples, and fail to detect novel object categories. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation of the aerial object detection problem, namely open-vocabulary aerial object detection (OVAD), which can detect objects beyond training categories without costly collecting new labeled data. We propose CastDet, a CLIP-activated student-teacher detection framework that serves as the first OVAD detector specifically designed for the challenging aerial scenario, where objects often exhibit weak appearance features and arbitrary orientations. Our framework integrates a robust localization teacher along with several box selection strategies to generate high-quality proposals for novel objects. Additionally, the RemoteCLIP model is adopted as an omniscient teacher, which provides rich knowledge to enhance classification capabilities for novel categories. A dynamic label queue is devised to maintain high-quality pseudo-labels during training. By doing so, the proposed CastDet boosts not only novel object proposals but also classification. Furthermore, we extend our approach from horizontal OVAD to oriented OVAD with tailored algorithm designs to effectively manage bounding box representation and pseudo-label generation. Extensive experiments for both tasks on multiple existing aerial object detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

It allows robots to perform tasks under the user's supervision. Current eye-tracking-driven approaches face several challenges. These include accuracy issues in 3D gaze estimation and difficulty interpreting gaze when differentiating between multiple tasks. We present an eye-tracking-driven control framework, aimed at enabling individuals with severe physical disabilities to perform daily tasks independently. Our system uses task pictograms as fiducial markers combined with a feature matching approach that transmits data of the selected object to accomplish necessary task related measurements with an eye-in-hand configuration. This eye-tracking control does not require knowledge of the user's position in relation to the object. The framework correctly interpreted object and task selection in up to 97.9% of measurements. Issues were found in the evaluation, that were improved and shared as lessons learned. The open-source framework can be adapted to new tasks and objects due to the integration of state-of-the-art object detection models.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, publication in review process</p></details> | None |

By integrating RGB with modalities such as thermal and depth, multi-modal fusion increases data redundancy and system robustness. However, significant challenges remain in effectively extracting task-relevant information both within and across modalities, as well as in achieving precise cross-modal alignment. While CNNs excel at feature extraction, they are limited by constrained receptive fields, strong inductive biases, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models offer global context but suffer from quadratic computational complexity and are confined to pairwise correlation modeling. Mamba and other State Space Models (SSMs), on the other hand, are hindered by their sequential scanning mechanism, which flattens 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, disrupting topological relationships and limiting the modeling of complex higher-order dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a multi-modal perception network based on hypergraph theory called M2I2HA. Our architecture includes an Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement module to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, and an Inter-Hypergraph Fusion module to align, enhance, and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps between data sources. We further introduce a M2-FullPAD module to enable adaptive multi-level fusion of multi-modal enhanced features within the network, meanwhile enhancing data distribution and flow across the architecture. Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets against baselines demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks.</p></details> | 43 pages, 13 figures | None |

Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without sharing raw data, yet practical support for modern YOLO pipelines under heterogeneous surgical data remains limited. We present UltraFlwr, an open-source, communication-efficient, and edge-deployable framework that integrates Ultralytics YOLO with the Flower FL platform and supports native Partial Aggregation (PA) of YOLO components (backbone, neck, head). Using two public laparoscopic surgical tool detection datasets, we conduct a systematic empirical study of federated YOLO training under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and multiple clinically motivated heterogeneous scenarios, including differences in data curation, video length, and label availability. Results show that standard FL aggregators (e.g., FedAvg) do not consistently match centralized training per client, but reduce inter-client performance variability. Aggregating both backbone and neck components achieves performance comparable to full aggregation with lower communication costs. Also, improving within-client data consistency can benefit FL even when it increases distribution shift across clients. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying federated YOLO-based object detection in heterogeneous surgical environments.

However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures | None |

Traditionally, this process demands physical inspection, introducing delays due to range safety protocols and increasing the risk of human error. We present an end-to-end computer vision system for automated bullet hole detection and iteration-based tracking directly from images taken at the firing line. Our approach combines YOLOv8 for accurate small-object detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) analysis to differentiate bullet holes across sequential images. To address the scarcity of labeled sequential data, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that removes rather than adds objects to simulate realistic firing sequences. Additionally, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline that standardizes target orientation using ORB-based perspective correction, improving model accuracy. Our system achieves 97.0% mean average precision on bullet hole detection and 88.8% accuracy in assigning bullet holes to the correct firing iteration. While designed for rifle zeroing, this framework offers broader applicability in domains requiring the temporal differentiation of visually similar objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (URTC)</p></details> | None |

Multimodal perception of intrinsic and extrinsic interactions is critical in building an intelligent robot that learns. This study presents a Vision-based See-Through Perception (VBSeeThruP) architecture that simultaneously perceives multiple intrinsic and extrinsic modalities from a single visual input, in a markerless manner, all packed into a soft robotic finger using the Soft Polyhedral Network design. It is generally applicable to miniature vision systems placed beneath deformable networks with a see-through design, capturing real-time images of the network's physical interactions induced by contact-based events, overlaid on the visual scene of the external environment, as demonstrated in the ablation study. We present the VBSeeThruP's capability for learning reactive grasping without using external cameras or dedicated force and torque sensors on the fingertips. Using the inpainted scene and the deformation mask, we further demonstrate the multimodal performance of the VBSeeThruP architecture to simultaneously achieve various perceptions, including but not limited to scene inpainting, object detection, depth sensing, scene segmentation, masked deformation tracking, 6D force/torque sensing, and contact event detection, all within a single sensory input from the in-finger vision markerlessly.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables, for supplementary videos, see https://bionicdl.ancorasir.com/?p=1658, for opensourced codes, see https://github.com/ancorasir/SeeThruFinger</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ancorasir/SeeThruFinger) |

Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment. We evaluate MGRAL's active learning performance on detection tasks over PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the highest AL curve with convincing visualizations, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026.

In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features, resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets. Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters, surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model (9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP.

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VFMs to simultaneously improve transferability and discriminability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

Nonetheless, the current voxelization methods commonly suffer from excessive computation complexity demands, where the fusion process is brittle, static, and breaks down under dynamic environmental settings. To this end, this research work enhances a novel Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model that seamlessly bridges the semantic strengths of camera modality with the geometric strengths of LiDAR modality through a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian model. The proposed solution has four key components: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), where depth-wise deformable sampling is employed for dealing with geometric sparsity, (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, where cross-entropy is employed for handling domain-specific noise, (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, where dynamic recalibration of sensor outputs is performed based on model outputs, and (4) Gauss-Mamba Head that uses Selective State Space Models for global context decoding that enjoys linear computation complexity.</p></details> | Master Thesis | None |

However, object detection models rely on costly bounding box annotations, limiting scalability. Weakly Semi-Supervised Object Detection (WSSOD) with point annotations proposes annotating each instance with a single point, minimizing annotation time while preserving localization signals. A Point-to-Box teacher model, trained on a small box-labeled subset, converts these point annotations into pseudo-box labels to train a student detector. Yet, medical imagery presents unique challenges, including overlapping anatomy, variable object sizes, and elusive structures, which hinder accurate bounding box inference. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DExTeR (DETR with Experts), a transformer-based Point-to-Box regressor tailored for medical imaging. Built upon Point-DETR, DExTeR encodes single-point annotations as object queries, refining feature extraction with the proposed class-guided deformable attention, which guides attention sampling using point coordinates and class labels to capture class-specific characteristics. To improve discrimination in complex structures, it introduces CLICK-MoE (CLass, Instance, and Common Knowledge Mixture of Experts), decoupling class and instance representations to reduce confusion among adjacent or overlapping instances. Finally, we implement a multi-point training strategy which promotes prediction consistency across different point placements, improving robustness to annotation variability. DExTeR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets spanning different medical domains (endoscopy, chest X-rays, and endoscopic ultrasound) highlighting its potential to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high detection accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality. Extensive experiments on the OmniHD-Scenes, View-of-Delft (VoD), and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that Doracamom achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks, establishing new benchmarks for multi-modal 3D perception. Code and models will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TCSVT</p></details> | None |
| **[Leveraging Transformer Decoder for Automotive Radar Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13386v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a Transformer-based architecture for 3D radar object detection that uses a novel Transformer Decoder as the prediction head to directly regress 3D bounding boxes and class scores from radar feature representations. To bridge multi-scale radar features and the decoder, we propose Pyramid Token Fusion (PTF), a lightweight module that converts a feature pyramid into a unified, scale-aware token sequence. By formulating detection as a set prediction problem with learnable object queries and positional encodings, our design models long-range spatial-temporal correlations and cross-feature interactions. This approach eliminates dense proposal generation and heuristic post-processing such as extensive non-maximum suppression (NMS) tuning. We evaluate the proposed framework on the RADDet, where it achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art radar-only baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Semi-supervised object detection(SSOD) aims to improve detection performance by leveraging a large number of unlabeled images alongside a limited number of labeled images(a.k.a.,few-shot learning). In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison of three state-of-the-art SSOD approaches, including MixPL, Semi-DETR and Consistent-Teacher, with the goal of understanding how performance varies with the number of labeled images. We conduct experiments using the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, two popular object detection benchmarks which allow for standardized evaluation. In addition, we evaluate the SSOD approaches on a custom Beetle dataset which enables us to gain insights into their performance on specialized datasets with a smaller number of object categories. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, model size, and latency, providing insights into which methods are best suited for low-data regimes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Infrared Object Detection with Ultra Small ConvNets: Is ImageNet Pretraining Still Useful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02927v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models, pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with less than 1M parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working conditions are different.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

| **[AsyncBEV: Cross-modal Flow Alignment in Asynchronous 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12994v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, multi-modal perception tasks like 3D object detection typically rely on well-synchronized sensors, both at training and inference. However, despite the use of hardware- or software-based synchronization algorithms, perfect synchrony is rarely guaranteed: Sensors may operate at different frequencies, and real-world factors such as network latency, hardware failures, or processing bottlenecks often introduce time offsets between sensors. Such asynchrony degrades perception performance, especially for dynamic objects. To address this challenge, we propose AsyncBEV, a trainable lightweight and generic module to improve the robustness of 3D Birds' Eye View (BEV) object detection models against sensor asynchrony. Inspired by scene flow estimation, AsyncBEV first estimates the 2D flow from the BEV features of two different sensor modalities, taking into account the known time offset between these sensor measurements. The predicted feature flow is then used to warp and spatially align the feature maps, which we show can easily be integrated into different current BEV detector architectures (e.g., BEV grid-based and token-based). Extensive experiments demonstrate AsyncBEV improves robustness against both small and large asynchrony between LiDAR or camera sensors in both the token-based CMT and grid-based UniBEV, especially for dynamic objects. We significantly outperform the ego motion compensated CMT and UniBEV baselines, notably by $16.6$ % and $11.9$ % NDS on dynamic objects in the worst-case scenario of a $0.5 s$ time offset. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

Within the area of object recognition, we propose and develop architectures tailored for MINT models. These architectures aim to optimize performance and efficiency in data utilization, offering a tailored solution to tackle the complexities inherent in the object recognition domain. We conducted experiments involving an object detection model, an embedding extractor, and a MINT module. These experiments were performed in three public databases, totaling over 174K images. The proposed architecture leverages convolutional layers to capture and model the activation patterns present in the data during the training process. Through our analysis, we are able to identify given data used for testing and training, achieving precision rates ranging between 70% and 80%, contingent upon the depth of the detection module layer chosen for input to the MINT module. Additionally, our studies entail an analysis of the factors influencing the MINT Module, delving into the contributing elements behind more transparent training processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Deplo...</summary><p>Deployable AI (DAI 2025) workshop co-located with AAAI-25</p></details> | None |

This paper analyzes a comprehensive analysis of YOLO26, an architecture that fundamentally redefines this paradigm by eliminating NMS in favor of a native end-to-end learning strategy. This study examines the critical innovations that enable this transition, specifically the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stabilizing lightweight backbones, STAL for small-target-aware assignment, and ProgLoss for dynamic supervision. Through a systematic review of official performance benchmarks, the results demonstrate that YOLO26 establishes a new Pareto front, outperforming a comprehensive suite of predecessors and state-of-the-art competitors (including RTMDet and DAMO-YOLO) in both inference speed and detection accuracy. The analysis confirms that by decoupling representation learning from heuristic post-processing, YOLOv26 successfully resolves the historical trade-off between latency and precision, signaling the next evolutionary step in edge-based computer vision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Unbiased Source-Free Object Detection via Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12765v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has garnered much attention in recent years by eliminating the need of source-domain data in cross-domain tasks, but existing SFOD methods suffer from the Source Bias problem, i.e. the adapted model remains skewed towards the source domain, leading to poor generalization and error accumulation during self-training. To overcome this challenge, we propose Debiased Source-free Object Detection (DSOD), a novel VFM-assisted SFOD framework that can effectively mitigate source bias with the help of powerful VFMs. Specifically, we propose Unified Feature Injection (UFI) module that integrates VFM features into the CNN backbone through Simple-Scale Extension (SSE) and Domain-aware Adaptive Weighting (DAAW). Then, we propose Semantic-aware Feature Regularization (SAFR) that constrains feature learning to prevent overfitting to source domain characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a VFM-free variant, termed DSOD-distill for computation-restricted scenarios through a novel Dual-Teacher distillation scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DSOD outperforms state-of-the-art SFOD methods, achieving 48.1% AP on Normal-to-Foggy weather adaptation, 39.3% AP on Cross-scene adaptation, and 61.4% AP on Synthetic-to-Real adaptation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RSOD: Reliability-Guided Sonar Image Object Detection with Extremely Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12715v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in sonar images is a key technology in underwater detection systems. Compared to natural images, sonar images contain fewer texture details and are more susceptible to noise, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish subtle differences between classes. This leads to their inability to provide precise annotation data for sonar images. Therefore, designing effective object detection methods for sonar images with extremely limited labels is particularly important. To address this, we propose a teacher-student framework called RSOD, which aims to fully learn the characteristics of sonar images and develop a pseudo-label strategy suitable for these images to mitigate the impact of limited labels. First, RSOD calculates a reliability score by assessing the consistency of the teacher's predictions across different views. To leverage this score, we introduce an object mixed pseudo-label method to tackle the shortage of labeled data in sonar images. Finally, we optimize the performance of the student by implementing a reliability-guided adaptive constraint. By taking full advantage of unlabeled data, the student can perform well even in situations with extremely limited labels. Notably, on the UATD dataset, our method, using only 5% of labeled data, achieves results that can compete against those of our baseline algorithm trained on 100% labeled data. We also collected a new dataset to provide more valuable data for research in the field of sonar.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026,9 pages,10 figures</p></details> | None |

We propose BlockSecRT-DETR, a BLOCKchain-SECured Real-Time Object DEtection TRansformer framework for ITS that provides a decentralized, token-efficient, and privacy-preserving federated training solution using RT-DETR transformer, incorporating a blockchain-secured update validation mechanism for trustworthy aggregation. In this framework, challenges (1) and (2) are jointly addressed through a unified client-side design that integrates RT-DETR training with a Token Engineering Module (TEM). TEM prunes low-utility tokens, reducing encoder complexity and latency on edge hardware, while aggregated updates mitigate non-IID data heterogeneity across clients. To address challenge (3), BlockSecRT-DETR incorporates a decentralized blockchain-secured update validation mechanism that enables tamper-proof, privacy-preserving, and trust-free authenticated model aggregation without relying on a central server. We evaluated the proposed framework under a missing-class Non-IID partition of the KITTI dataset and conducted a blockchain case study to quantify security overhead. TEM improves inference latency by 17.2% and reduces encoder FLOPs by 47.8%, while maintaining global detection accuracy (89.20% mAP@0.5). The blockchain integration adds 400 ms per round, and the ledger size remains under 12 KB due to metadata-only on-chain storage.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mixed Precision PointPillars for Efficient 3D Object Detection with TensorRT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12638v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LIDAR 3D object detection is one of the important tasks for autonomous vehicles. Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models. With TensorRT deployment, our models offer less latency and sizes by up to 2.35 and 2.26 times, respectively.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[SDCoNet: Saliency-Driven Multi-Task Collaborative Network for Remote Sensing Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12507v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In remote sensing images, complex backgrounds, weak object signals, and small object scales make accurate detection particularly challenging, especially under low-quality imaging conditions. A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images.

This paper presents a multimodal wearable assistive system that integrates object detection with vision-language models to support independent product or item retrieval, with the goal of enhancing users'autonomy and sense of agency. The system operates through three phases: product search, which identifies target products using YOLO-World detection combined with embedding similarity and color histogram matching; product navigation, which provides spatialized sonification and VLM-generated verbal descriptions to guide users toward the target; and product correction, which verifies whether the user has reached the correct product and provides corrective feedback when necessary. Technical evaluation demonstrated promising performance across all modules, with product detection achieving near-perfect accuracy at close range and high accuracy when facing shelves within 1.5 m. VLM-based navigation achieved up to 94.4% accuracy, and correction accuracy exceeded 86% under optimal model configurations. These results demonstrate the system's potential to address the last-meter problem in assistive shopping. Future work will focus on user studies with pBLV participants and integration with multi-scale navigation ecosystems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the long imaging distance and complex imaging mechanisms, targets in remote sensing images often face challenges such as small object size, dense distribution, and low inter-class discriminability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-modal remote sensing object detection network called RemoteDet-Mamba, which is based on a patch-level four-direction selective scanning fusion strategy. This method simultaneously learns unimodal local features and fuses cross-modal patch-level global semantic information, thereby enhancing the distinguishability of small objects and improving inter-class discrimination. Furthermore, the designed lightweight fusion mechanism effectively decouples densely packed targets while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that RemoteDet-Mamba achieves superior detection performance compared to current mainstream methods, while maintaining low parameter count and computational overhead, showing promising potential for practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026</p></details> | None |

The proposed architecture is composed of two stacks running simultaneously, an on-board driving stack that includes a stereo camera for scene understanding, and a digital twin stack that runs an Unreal Engine 5 replica of the scene viewed by the camera as well as returning safety alerts to the cockpit. The on-board stack is implemented on the vehicle side including 2 main autonomous modules; localization and perception. The position and orientation of the ego vehicle are obtained using on-board sensors. Furthermore, the perception module is responsible for processing 20-fps images from stereo camera and understands the scene through two complementary pipelines. The pipeline are working on object detection and feature extraction including object velocity, yaw and the safety metrics time-to-collision and time-headway. The collected data form the driving stack are sent to the infrastructure side through the ROS-enabled architecture in the form of custom ROS2 messages and sent over UDP links that ride a 4G modem for V2I communication. The environment is monitored via the digital twin through the shared messages which update the information of the spawned ego vehicle and detected objects based on the real-time localization and perception data.

Mining these long-tail events from massive real-world driving logs is therefore a critical step in the robotic development lifecycle. The goal of the Scenario Mining task is to retrieve useful information to enable targeted re-simulation, regression testing, and failure analysis of the robot's decision-making algorithms. RefAV, introduced by the Argoverse team, is an end-to-end framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to spatially and temporally localize scenarios described in natural language. However, this process performs retrieval on trajectory labels, ignoring the direct connection between natural language and raw RGB images, which runs counter to the intuition of video retrieval; it also depends on the quality of upstream 3D object detection and tracking. Further, inaccuracies in trajectory data lead to inaccuracies in downstream spatial and temporal localization. To address these issues, we propose Robust Scenario Mining for Robotic Autonomy from Coarse to Fine (SMc2f), a coarse-to-fine pipeline that employs vision-language models (VLMs) for coarse image-text filtering, builds a database of successful mining cases on top of RefAV and automatically retrieves exemplars to few-shot condition the LLM for more robust retrieval, and introduces text-trajectory contrastive learning to pull matched pairs together and push mismatched pairs apart in a shared embedding space, yielding a fine-grained matcher that refines the LLM's candidate trajectories. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate substantial gains in both retrieval quality and efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

This limits their holistic understanding and efficiency on low-power edge devices. To address this, we present a real-time multi-modal vision framework that integrates object detection, owner-specific face recognition, and emotion detection into a unified pipeline deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 edge platform. The core of our system is an adaptive scheduling mechanism that reduces computational load by 65\% compared to continuous processing by selectively activating modules such as, YOLOv8n for object detection, a custom FaceNet-based embedding system for facial recognition, and DeepFace's CNN for emotion classification. Experimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy, with the object detection module achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.861, facial recognition attaining 88\% accuracy, and emotion detection showing strong discriminatory power (AUC up to 0.97 for specific emotions), while operating at 5.6 frames per second. Our work demonstrates that context-aware scheduling is the key to unlocking complex multi-modal AI on cost-effective edge hardware, making intelligent perception more accessible and privacy-preserving.</p></details> |  | None |

Although myriads of large-scale pre-training efforts have built versatile foundation models that exhibit impressive zero-shot capabilities to facilitate OVOD, the necessity of creating a universal understanding for any object cognition according to already pretrained foundation models is usually overlooked. Therefore, in this paper, a training-free Guess What Vision Language Model, called GW-VLM, is proposed to form a universal understanding paradigm based on our carefully designed Multi-Scale Visual Language Searching (MS-VLS) coupled with Contextual Concept Prompt (CCP) for OVOD. This approach can engage a pre-trained Vision Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM) in the game of "guess what". Wherein, MS-VLS leverages multi-scale visual-language soft-alignment for VLM to generate snippets from the results of class-agnostic object detection, while CCP can form the concept of flow referring to MS-VLS and then make LLM understand snippets for OVOD. Finally, the extensive experiments are carried out on natural and remote sensing datasets, including COCO val, Pascal VOC, DIOR, and NWPU-10, and the results indicate that our proposed GW-VLM can achieve superior OVOD performance compared to the-state-of-the-art methods without any training step.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches depend heavily on manual monitoring, resulting in limited scalability and operational inefficiencies. This work introduces a dual-task model based on EfficientNetB4 capable of performing airborne object classification and threat-level prediction simultaneously. To address the scarcity of clean, balanced training data, we constructed the AODTA Dataset by aggregating and refining multiple public sources. We benchmarked our approach on both the AVD Dataset and the newly developed AODTA Dataset and further compared performance against a ResNet-50 baseline, which consistently underperformed EfficientNetB4. Our EfficientNetB4 model achieved 96% accuracy in object classification and 90% accuracy in threat-level prediction, underscoring its promise for applications in surveillance, defense, and airspace management.

Recently, methods approaching the alignment of the intermediate features proven to be promising, achieving state-of-the-art results. However, these methods are laborious to implement and hard to interpret. Although promising, there is still room for improvements to close the performance gap toward the upper-bound (when training with the target data). In this work, we propose a method to generate an artificial dataset in the target domain to train an object detector. We employed two unsupervised image translators (CycleGAN and an AdaIN-based model) using only annotated data from the source domain and non-annotated data from the target domain. Our key contributions are the proposal of a less complex yet more effective method that also has an improved interpretability. Results on real-world scenarios for autonomous driving show significant improvements, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in most cases, further closing the gap toward the upper-bound.</p></details> |  | None |

To overcome the evaluation bottleneck, we propose an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that assesses nuanced visual similarity and category relevance for query-result pairs in a zero-shot manner, removing dependence on human annotations or noise-prone catalog data. Deployed at scale on a global home goods platform, our system improves retrieval quality and yields a measurable uplift in customer engagement, while our offline evaluation metrics strongly correlate with real-world outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose RealCamo, a novel out-painting-based framework for controllable realistic camouflaged image generation. RealCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multimodal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 25 pages | None |

However, point-cloud-based radar representations suffer from information loss due to multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar tensors incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that efficiently fuses raw 4D radar cubes with camera images via decoupled multi-view radar representations. Our approach introduces two key components: (1) A Wavelet Attention Module embedded in a wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), which enhances the representation of sparse radar signals and image data by capturing joint spatial-frequency features, thereby mitigating information loss while maintaining computational efficiency. (2) A Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion mechanism, a two-stage query-based fusion strategy that progressively aligns multi-view radar and visual features through geometric priors, enabling modality-agnostic and efficient integration without overwhelming computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the K-Radar benchmark show that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the best existing model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in sleet conditions, demonstrating strong robustness in adverse weather.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures | None |

These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily. We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency. We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs. Strong performance across two very different domains confirms that DFIR-DETR generalizes well and works effectively in resource-limited settings for cross-scene small object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

This paper presents a purpose-built lightweight object detection model designed to identify young pedestrians in various environmental scenarios. To address these challenges, our approach leverages thermal imaging from long-wave infrared (LWIR) cameras, which enhances detection reliability in conditions where traditional RGB cameras operating in the visible spectrum fail. Based on the YOLO11 architecture and customized for thermal detection, our model, termed LTV-YOLO (Lightweight Thermal Vision YOLO), is optimized for computational efficiency, accuracy and real-time performance on edge devices. By integrating separable convolutions in depth and a feature pyramid network (FPN), LTV-YOLO achieves strong performance in detecting small-scale, partially occluded, and thermally distinct VRUs while maintaining a compact architecture. This work contributes a practical and scalable solution to improve pedestrian safety in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in school zones, autonomous navigation, and smart city infrastructure. Unlike prior thermal detectors, our contribution is task-specific: a thermally only edge-capable design designed for young and small VRUs (children and distant adults). Although FPN and depthwise separable convolutions are standard components, their integration into a thermal-only pipeline optimized for short/occluded VRUs under adverse conditions is, to the best of our knowledge, novel.</p></details> |  | None |

Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage of real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures Updated with the camera-ready version after acceptance</p></details> | None |
| **[Beyond Single Prompts: Synergistic Fusion and Arrangement for VICL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10117v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) enables inpainting models to quickly adapt to new visual tasks from only a few prompts. However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements. We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Visual In-Context Learning by Multi-Faceted Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10107v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant "retrieve-then-prompt" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

For safe deployment in robotics and autonomous systems, we need to predict when to trust VLM spatial predictions rather than accepting all outputs. We propose a vision-based confidence estimation framework that validates VLM predictions through independent geometric verification using object detection. Unlike text-based approaches relying on self-assessment, our method fuses four signals via gradient boosting: geometric alignment between VLM claims and coordinates, spatial ambiguity from overlap, detection quality, and VLM internal uncertainty. We achieve 0.674 AUROC on BLIP-2 (34.0% improvement over text-based baselines) and 0.583 AUROC on CLIP (16.1% improvement), generalizing across generative and classification architectures. Our framework enables selective prediction: at 60% target accuracy, we achieve 61.9% coverage versus 27.6% baseline (2.2x improvement) on BLIP-2. Feature analysis reveals vision-based signals contribute 87.4% of model importance versus 12.7% from VLM confidence, validating that external geometric verification outperforms self-assessment. We demonstrate reliable scene graph construction where confidence-based pruning improves precision from 52.1% to 78.3% while retaining 68.2% of edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes Model-Driven Data Correction (MDDC), a data-centric framework that enhances detection performance by iteratively diagnosing and correcting data quality deficiencies. An automated error analysis procedure categorizes detection failures into four types: false negatives, false positives, class confusion, and localization errors. These error patterns are systematically addressed through a structured train-fix-retrain pipeline with version-controlled data management. Experimental results on multiple weed detection datasets demonstrate consistent improvements of 5-25 percent in mAP at 0.5 using a fixed lightweight detector (YOLOv8n), indicating that systematic data quality optimization can effectively alleviate performance bottlenecks under fixed model capacity constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICPR 2026, currently under review</p></details> | None |

YOLO26, released in September 2025, stands as the newest and most advanced member of the YOLO family, purpose-built to deliver efficiency, accuracy, and deployment readiness on edge and low-power devices. The paper sequentially details architectural innovations of YOLO26, including the removal of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), adoption of end-to-end NMS-free inference, integration of ProgLoss and Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stable convergence. Beyond architecture, the study positions YOLO26 as a multi-task framework, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, pose/keypoints estimation, oriented detection, and classification. We present performance benchmarks of YOLO26 on edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Orin, comparing its results with YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12, YOLOv13, and transformer-based detectors(RF-DETR and RT-DETR). This paper further explores real-time deployment pathways, flexible export options (ONNX, TensorRT, CoreML, TFLite), and quantization for INT8/FP16. Practical use cases of YOLO26 across robotics, manufacturing, and IoT are highlighted to demonstrate cross-industry adaptability.

To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

Conditional Diffusion Model for Galaxy Morphology Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16233v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observational astronomy relies on visual feature identification to detect critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets, whether from simulations or human annotation, a challenge pronounced for rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for augmenting ML training data (hereafter GalaxySD). Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains visual feature, galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate that GalaxySD generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images that closely adhere to the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting completeness and purity by up to 30% across key metrics. For rare object detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features (~0.1% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of detected instances, from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical foundation model developments.

| **[Towards Robust Cross-Dataset Object Detection Generalization under Domain Specificity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09497v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detectors often perform well in-distribution, yet degrade sharply on a different benchmark. We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\% mAP).

A Comparative Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22164v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables zero-shot recognition of novel categories through vision-language models, achieving strong performance on natural images. However, transferability to aerial imagery remains unexplored. We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck. Prompt engineering strategies such as domain-specific prefixing and synonym expansion, fail to provide meaningful performance gains. Performance varies dramatically across datasets (F1: 0.53 on DIOR, 0.12 on FAIR1M), exposing brittleness to imaging conditions. These findings establish baseline expectations and highlight the need for domain-adaptive approaches in aerial OVD.</p></details> |  | None |

However, solving motion and perception tasks simultaneously is challenging, as these objectives often impose conflicting requirements. Furthermore, while robots must react quickly to changes in the environment, directly evaluating the quality of perception (e.g., object detection confidence) is often expensive or infeasible at runtime. This problem is especially important in human-centered environments, such as homes and hospitals, where effective perception is essential for safe and reliable operation. In this work, we address the challenge of solving motion planning problems for high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robots from a start to a goal configuration with continuous perception constraints under both static and dynamic environments. We propose a GPU-parallelized perception-score-guided probabilistic roadmap planner with a neural surrogate model (PS-PRM). Unlike existing active perception-, visibility-aware or learning-based planners, our work integrates perception tasks and constraints directly into the motion planning formulation. Our method uses a neural surrogate model to approximate perception scores, incorporates them into the roadmap, and leverages GPU parallelism to enable efficient online replanning in dynamic settings. We demonstrate that our planner, evaluated on high-DoF robots, outperforms baseline methods in both static and dynamic environments in both simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 13 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

To address this challenge, we propose {\bf DentalX}, a novel context-aware dental disease detection approach that leverages oral structure information to mitigate the visual ambiguity inherent in radiographs. Specifically, we introduce a structural context extraction module that learns an auxiliary task: semantic segmentation of dental anatomy. The module extracts meaningful structural context and integrates it into the primary disease detection task to enhance the detection of subtle dental diseases. Extensive experiments on a dedicated benchmark demonstrate that DentalX significantly outperforms prior methods in both tasks.

We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively. Thirdly, a unified prompt optimization scheme for multi-task adaptation is implemented. This scheme strategically injects structured event logs from the YOLO models as contextual information into BLIP-2's input. Combined with output constraints designed to filter out technical details, this approach effectively guides the model to generate accurate and contextually relevant outputs for various tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Tenth International Conference on Data Mining and Big Data (DMBD'2025)</p></details> | None |

But its point clouds are still sparse and noisy, making it challenging to meet the requirements of autonomous driving. Camera, as another commonly used sensor, can capture rich semantic information. As a result, the fusion of 4D radar and camera can provide an affordable and robust perception solution for autonomous driving systems. However, previous radar-camera fusion methods have not yet been thoroughly investigated, resulting in a large performance gap compared to LiDAR-based methods. Specifically, they ignore the feature-blurring problem and do not deeply interact with image semantic information. To this end, we present a simple but effective multi-stage sampling fusion (MSSF) network based on 4D radar and camera. On the one hand, we design a fusion block that can deeply interact point cloud features with image features, and can be applied to commonly used single-modal backbones in a plug-and-play manner. The fusion block encompasses two types, namely, simple feature fusion (SFF) and multiscale deformable feature fusion (MSDFF). The SFF is easy to implement, while the MSDFF has stronger fusion abilities. On the other hand, we propose a semantic-guided head to perform foreground-background segmentation on voxels with voxel feature re-weighting, further alleviating the problem of feature blurring. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadset datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MSSF. Notably, compared to state-of-the-art methods, MSSF achieves a 7.0% and 4.0% improvement in 3D mean average precision on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets, respectively. It even surpasses classical LiDAR-based methods on the VoD dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>T-TIT...</summary><p>T-TITS accepted, code avaliable</p></details> | None |

Although many existing lightweight models manage to reduce computation considerably, they often do so at the expense of a substantial increase in parameter count (e.g., LSNet, MobileMamba), which still poses obstacles for deployment on resource-limited devices. In parallel, some studies attempt to draw inspiration from human visual perception, but their modeling tends to oversimplify the visual process, making it hard to reflect how perception truly operates. Revisiting the cooperative mechanism of the human visual system, we propose GPM (Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding). GPM first employs a Global Insight Generator (GIG) to extract holistic cues, and subsequently processes features of different scales through parallel branches: LSAE emphasizes mid-/large-scale semantic relations, while IRB (Inverted Residual Block) preserves fine-grained texture information, jointly enabling coherent representation of global and local features. As such, GPM conforms to two characteristic behaviors of human vision perceiving the whole before focusing on details, and maintaining broad contextual awareness even during local attention. Built upon GPM, we further develop the lightweight H-GPE network. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation show that H-GPE achieves strong performance while maintaining a balanced footprint in both FLOPs and parameters, delivering a more favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared with recent state-of-the-art lightweight models.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures | None |

On top of this foundation, we improve cross-platform generalization by narrowing domain gaps through tailored data augmentation and a self-training strategy with pseudo-labels. These enhancements enabled our approach to secure the 3rd place in the challenge, achieving a 3D AP of 62.67% for the Car category on the phase-1 target domain, and 58.76% and 49.81% for Car and Pedestrian categories respectively on the phase-2 target domain.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08165v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical contrastive vision-language pre-training (VLP) has demonstrated significant potential in improving performance on downstream tasks. Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data. Codes and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 8 pages</p></details> | None |

Our three-stage framework first synthesizes target objects within domain-specific backgrounds through controlled inpainting. The generated outputs are then validated via a multi-modal assessment that integrates object detection, aesthetic scoring, and vision-language alignment. Finally, a user-preference classifier is employed to capture subjective selection criteria. This pipeline enables the efficient construction of high-quality, deployable datasets while reducing reliance on extensive real-world data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Workshop on Synthetic & Adversarial ForEnsics (SAFE), WACV 2026 (oral presentation)</p></details> | None |
| **[REXO: Indoor Multi-View Radar Object Detection via 3D Bounding Box Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17806v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset. The REXO implementation is available at https://github.com/merlresearch/radar-bbox-diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages; Accepted to AAAI 2026; Code available at https://github.com/merlresearch/radar-bbox-diffusion</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/merlresearch/radar-bbox-diffusion) |
| **[GenDet: Painting Colored Bounding Boxes on Images via Diffusion Model for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07273v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents GenDet, a novel framework that redefines object detection as an image generation task. In contrast to traditional approaches, GenDet adopts a pioneering approach by leveraging generative modeling: it conditions on the input image and directly generates bounding boxes with semantic annotations in the original image space. GenDet establishes a conditional generation architecture built upon the large-scale pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, formulating the detection task as semantic constraints within the latent space. It enables precise control over bounding box positions and category attributes, while preserving the flexibility of the generative model. This novel methodology effectively bridges the gap between generative models and discriminative tasks, providing a fresh perspective for constructing unified visual understanding systems. Systematic experiments demonstrate that GenDet achieves competitive accuracy compared to discriminative detectors, while retaining the flexibility characteristic of generative methods.</p></details> |  | None |
