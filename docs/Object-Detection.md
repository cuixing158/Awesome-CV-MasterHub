However, existing FL frameworks struggle to balance privacy, fairness, and robustness, leading to performance disparities across demographic groups. Privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy mitigate data leakage risks but worsen fairness by restricting access to sensitive attributes needed for bias correction. This work explores the trade-off between privacy and fairness in FL-based object detection for AVs and introduces RESFL, an integrated solution optimizing both. RESFL incorporates adversarial privacy disentanglement and uncertainty-guided fairness-aware aggregation. The adversarial component uses a gradient reversal layer to remove sensitive attributes, reducing privacy risks while maintaining fairness. The uncertainty-aware aggregation employs an evidential neural network to weight client updates adaptively, prioritizing contributions with lower fairness disparities and higher confidence. This ensures robust and equitable FL model updates. We evaluate RESFL on the FACET dataset and CARLA simulator, assessing accuracy, fairness, privacy resilience, and robustness under varying conditions. RESFL improves detection accuracy, reduces fairness disparities, and lowers privacy attack success rates while demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial conditions compared to other approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PETS 2025 (under review)</p></details> | None |
| **[MapGlue: Multimodal Remote Sensing Image Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16185v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching is pivotal for cross-modal fusion, localization, and object detection, but it faces severe challenges due to geometric, radiometric, and viewpoint discrepancies across imaging modalities. Existing unimodal datasets lack scale and diversity, limiting deep learning solutions. This paper proposes MapGlue, a universal MRSI matching framework, and MapData, a large-scale multimodal dataset addressing these gaps. Our contributions are twofold. MapData, a globally diverse dataset spanning 233 sampling points, offers original images (7,000x5,000 to 20,000x15,000 pixels). After rigorous cleaning, it provides 121,781 aligned electronic map-visible image pairs (512x512 pixels) with hybrid manual-automated ground truth, addressing the scarcity of scalable multimodal benchmarks. MapGlue integrates semantic context with a dual graph-guided mechanism to extract cross-modal invariant features. This structure enables global-to-local interaction, enhancing descriptor robustness against modality-specific distortions. Extensive evaluations on MapData and five public datasets demonstrate MapGlue's superiority in matching accuracy under complex conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MapGlue generalizes effectively to unseen modalities without retraining, highlighting its adaptability. This work addresses longstanding challenges in MRSI matching by combining scalable dataset construction with a robust, semantics-driven framework. Furthermore, MapGlue shows strong generalization capabilities on other modality matching tasks for which it was not specifically trained.

| **[Bring Remote Sensing Object Detect Into Nature Language Model: Using SFT Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08144v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks. However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Uncertainty Meets Diversity: A Comprehensive Active Learning Framework for Indoor 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16125v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the substantial annotation burden in 3D object detection tasks, spurring several initiatives in outdoor environments. However, its application in indoor environments remains unexplored. Compared to outdoor 3D datasets, indoor datasets face significant challenges, including fewer training samples per class, a greater number of classes, more severe class imbalance, and more diverse scene types and intra-class variances. This paper presents the first study on active learning for indoor 3D object detection, where we propose a novel framework tailored for this task. Our method incorporates two key criteria - uncertainty and diversity - to actively select the most ambiguous and informative unlabeled samples for annotation. The uncertainty criterion accounts for both inaccurate detections and undetected objects, ensuring that the most ambiguous samples are prioritized. Meanwhile, the diversity criterion is formulated as a joint optimization problem that maximizes the diversity of both object class distributions and scene types, using a new Class-aware Adaptive Prototype (CAP) bank. The CAP bank dynamically allocates representative prototypes to each class, helping to capture varying intra-class diversity across different categories. We evaluate our method on SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2, where it outperforms baselines by a significant margin, achieving over 85% of fully-supervised performance with just 10% of the annotation budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Semantic-Guided Global-Local Collaborative Networks for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16056v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of measurement systems, which are integral to various vision-based instrumentation and measurement applications. These systems often require clear and detailed images for precise object detection and recognition. However, images captured by visual measurement tools frequently suffer from degradation, including blurring and loss of detail, which can impede measurement accuracy.As a potential remedy, we in this paper propose a Semantic-Guided Global-Local Collaborative Network (SGGLC-Net) for lightweight SISR. Our SGGLC-Net leverages semantic priors extracted from a pre-trained model to guide the super-resolution process, enhancing image detail quality effectively. Specifically,we propose a Semantic Guidance Module that seamlessly integrates the semantic priors into the super-resolution network, enabling the network to more adeptly capture and utilize semantic priors, thereby enhancing image details. To further explore both local and non-local interactions for improved detail rendition,we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Module, which features three Global and Local Detail Enhancement Modules, as well as a Hybrid Attention Mechanism to work together to efficiently learn more useful features. Our extensive experiments show that SGGLC-Net achieves competitive PSNR and SSIM values across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating higher performance with the multi-adds reduction of 12.81G compared to state-of-the-art lightweight super-resolution approaches. These improvements underscore the potential of our approach to enhance the precision and effectiveness of visual measurement systems.

| **[I2AM: Interpreting Image-to-Image Latent Diffusion Models via Bi-Attribution Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12331v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale diffusion models have made significant advances in image generation, particularly through cross-attention mechanisms. While cross-attention has been well-studied in text-to-image tasks, their interpretability in image-to-image (I2I) diffusion models remains underexplored. This paper introduces Image-to-Image Attribution Maps (I2AM), a method that enhances the interpretability of I2I models by visualizing bidirectional attribution maps, from the reference image to the generated image and vice versa. I2AM aggregates cross-attention scores across time steps, attention heads, and layers, offering insights into how critical features are transferred between images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of I2AM across object detection, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our results demonstrate that I2AM successfully identifies key regions responsible for generating the output, even in complex scenes. Additionally, we introduce the Inpainting Mask Attention Consistency Score (IMACS) as a novel evaluation metric to assess the alignment between attribution maps and inpainting masks, which correlates strongly with existing performance metrics. Through extensive experiments, we show that I2AM enables model debugging and refinement, providing practical tools for improving I2I model's performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 23 pages | None |
| **[HS-FPN: High Frequency and Spatial Perception FPN for Tiny Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10116v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) has significantly improved object detection performance. However, substantial challenges remain in detecting tiny objects, as their features occupy only a very small proportion of the feature maps. Although FPN integrates multi-scale features, it does not directly enhance or enrich the features of tiny objects. Furthermore, FPN lacks spatial perception ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel High Frequency and Spatial Perception Feature Pyramid Network (HS-FPN) with two innovative modules. First, we designed a high frequency perception module (HFP) that generates high frequency responses through high pass filters. These high frequency responses are used as mask weights from both spatial and channel perspectives to enrich and highlight the features of tiny objects in the original feature maps. Second, we developed a spatial dependency perception module (SDP) to capture the spatial dependencies that FPN lacks. Our experiments demonstrate that detectors based on HS-FPN exhibit competitive advantages over state-of-the-art models on the AI-TOD dataset for tiny object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,12 figures,7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[UDA4Inst: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09682v5)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation is crucial for autonomous driving but is hindered by the lack of annotated real-world data due to expensive labeling costs. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) show remarkable performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, very few have been proposed for instance segmentation in vision-based autonomous driving. Moreover, existing methods rely on suboptimal baselines, which severely limits performance. We introduce \textbf{UDA4Inst}, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through \textit{Semantic Category Training} and \textit{Bidirectional Mixing Training}. With the Semantic Category Training method, semantically related classes are grouped and trained separately, enabling the generation of higher-quality pseudo-labels and improved segmentation performance. We further propose a bidirectional cross-domain data mixing strategy that combines instance-wise and patch-wise mixing techniques to effectively utilize data from both source and target domains, producing realistic composite images that improve the model's generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes benchmark with mAP 31.3. Notably, we are the first to report results on multiple novel synth-to-real instance segmentation datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as source domains while Cityscapes and KITTI360 serve as target domains. Our code will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-Grained Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with Fined-Grained Prompts: Task, Dataset and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14862v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary detectors are proposed to locate and recognize objects in novel classes. However, variations in vision-aware language vocabulary data used for open-vocabulary learning can lead to unfair and unreliable evaluations. Recent evaluation methods have attempted to address this issue by incorporating object properties or adding locations and characteristics to the captions. Nevertheless, since these properties and locations depend on the specific details of the images instead of classes, detectors can not make accurate predictions without precise descriptions provided through human annotation. This paper introduces 3F-OVD, a novel task that extends supervised fine-grained object detection to the open-vocabulary setting. Our task is intuitive and challenging, requiring a deep understanding of Fine-grained captions and careful attention to Fine-grained details in images in order to accurately detect Fine-grained objects. Additionally, due to the scarcity of qualified fine-grained object detection datasets, we have created a new dataset, NEU-171K, tailored for both supervised and open-vocabulary settings. We benchmark state-of-the-art object detectors on our dataset for both settings. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective post-processing technique.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, these methods suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions. The weather-robust 4D radar provides Doppler and additional geometric information, raising the possibility of addressing this challenge. To this end, we present V2X-R, the first simulated V2X dataset incorporating LiDAR, camera, and 4D radar. V2X-R contains 12,079 scenarios with 37,727 frames of LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds, 150,908 images, and 170,859 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline for 3D object detection and implement it with various fusion strategies. To achieve weather-robust detection, we additionally propose a Multi-modal Denoising Diffusion (MDD) module in our fusion pipeline. MDD utilizes weather-robust 4D radar feature as a condition to prompt the diffusion model to denoise noisy LiDAR features. Experiments show that our LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline demonstrates superior performance in the V2X-R dataset. Over and above this, our MDD module further improved the performance of basic fusion model by up to 5.73%/6.70% in foggy/snowy conditions with barely disrupting normal performance. The dataset and code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/ylwhxht/V2X-R.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/ylwhxht/V2X-R) |

While these models perform well in the trained clean weather, they struggle in unseen adverse weather conditions with the domain gap. In this paper, we propose a Domain Generalization based approach, named \textit{V2X-DGW}, for LiDAR-based 3D object detection on multi-agent perception system under adverse weather conditions. Our research aims to not only maintain favorable multi-agent performance in the clean weather but also promote the performance in the unseen adverse weather conditions by learning only on the clean weather data. To realize the Domain Generalization, we first introduce the Adaptive Weather Augmentation (AWA) to mimic the unseen adverse weather conditions, and then propose two alignments for generalizable representation learning: Trust-region Weather-invariant Alignment (TWA) and Agent-aware Contrastive Alignment (ACA). To evaluate this research, we add Fog, Rain, Snow conditions on two publicized multi-agent datasets based on physics-based models, resulting in two new datasets: OPV2V-w and V2XSet-w. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our V2X-DGW achieved significant improvements in the unseen adverse weathers.

The YOLOv12n configuration achieved the highest precision at 0.916, the highest recall at 0.969, and the highest mean Average Precision (mAP@50) at 0.978. In comparison, the YOLOv11 series was led by YOLO11x, which achieved the highest precision at 0.857, recall at 0.85, and mAP@50 at 0.91. For the YOLOv10 series, YOLOv10b and YOLOv10l both achieved the highest precision at 0.85, with YOLOv10n achieving the highest recall at 0.8 and mAP@50 at 0.89. These findings demonstrated that YOLOv12, when trained on realistic LLM-generated datasets surpassed its predecessors in key performance metrics. The technique also offered a cost-effective solution by reducing the need for extensive manual data collection in the agricultural field. In addition, this study compared the computational efficiency of all versions of YOLOv12, v11 and v10, where YOLOv11n reported the lowest inference time at 4.7 ms, compared to YOLOv12n's 5.6 ms and YOLOv10n's 5.9 ms. Although YOLOv12 is new and more accurate than YOLOv11, and YOLOv10, YOLO11n still stays the fastest YOLO model among YOLOv10, YOLOv11 and YOLOv12 series of models.

Existing methods achieve certain success by improving knowledge distillation and exemplar replay for transformer-based detection frameworks, but the intrinsic forgetting mechanisms remain underexplored. In this paper, we dive into the cause of forgetting and discover forgetting imbalance between localization and recognition in transformer-based IOD, which means that localization is less-forgetting and can generalize to future classes, whereas catastrophic forgetting occurs primarily on recognition. Based on these insights, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Amnesia (DCA) strategy, which redesigns the transformer-based IOD into a localization-then-recognition process. DCA can well maintain and transfer the localization ability, leaving decoupled fragile recognition to be specially conquered. To reduce feature drift in recognition, we leverage semantic knowledge encoded in pre-trained language models to anchor class representations within a unified feature space across incremental tasks. This involves designing a duplex classifier fusion and embedding class semantic features into the recognition decoding process in the form of queries. Extensive experiments validate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially for long-term incremental scenarios. For example, under the four-step setting on MS-COCO, our DCA strategy significantly improves the final AP by 6.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Test-Time Backdoor Detection for Object Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15293v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers poison a small subset of training samples by embedding a predefined trigger to manipulate prediction. Detecting poisoned samples (i.e., those containing triggers) at test time can prevent backdoor activation. However, unlike image classification tasks, the unique characteristics of object detection -- particularly its output of numerous objects -- pose fresh challenges for backdoor detection. The complex attack effects (e.g., "ghost" object emergence or "vanishing" object) further render current defenses fundamentally inadequate. To this end, we design TRAnsformation Consistency Evaluation (TRACE), a brand-new method for detecting poisoned samples at test time in object detection. Our journey begins with two intriguing observations: (1) poisoned samples exhibit significantly more consistent detection results than clean ones across varied backgrounds. (2) clean samples show higher detection consistency when introduced to different focal information. Based on these phenomena, TRACE applies foreground and background transformations to each test sample, then assesses transformation consistency by calculating the variance in objects confidences. TRACE achieves black-box, universal backdoor detection, with extensive experiments showing a 30% improvement in AUROC over state-of-the-art defenses and resistance to adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[State Space Model Meets Transformer: A New Paradigm for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14493v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DETR-based methods, which use multi-layer transformer decoders to refine object queries iteratively, have shown promising performance in 3D indoor object detection. However, the scene point features in the transformer decoder remain fixed, leading to minimal contributions from later decoder layers, thereby limiting performance improvement. Recently, State Space Models (SSM) have shown efficient context modeling ability with linear complexity through iterative interactions between system states and inputs. Inspired by SSMs, we propose a new 3D object DEtection paradigm with an interactive STate space model (DEST). In the interactive SSM, we design a novel state-dependent SSM parameterization method that enables system states to effectively serve as queries in 3D indoor detection tasks. In addition, we introduce four key designs tailored to the characteristics of point cloud and SSM: The serialization and bidirectional scanning strategies enable bidirectional feature interaction among scene points within the SSM. The inter-state attention mechanism models the relationships between state points, while the gated feed-forward network enhances inter-channel correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to model queries as system states and scene points as system inputs, which can simultaneously update scene point features and query features with linear complexity. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DEST-based method. Our method improves the GroupFree baseline in terms of AP50 on ScanNet V2 (+5.3) and SUN RGB-D (+3.2) datasets. Based on the VDETR baseline, Our method sets a new SOTA on the ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025.

The key to accurate 3D object detection is in effective voxel representation. However, due to occlusion and lack of 3D information, constructing 3D features from multi-view 2D images is challenging. Addressing that, we introduce a unique 3D positional information embedded voxel optimization mechanism to fuse multi-view features. To prioritize neural field reconstruction in object regions, we also devise a double importance sampling scheme for the NeRF branch of our detector. We additionally propose an opacity optimization module for precise voxel opacity prediction by enforcing multi-view consistency constraints. Moreover, to further improve voxel density consistency across multiple perspectives, we incorporate ray distance as a weighting factor to minimize cumulative ray errors. Our unique modules synergetically form an end-to-end neural model that establishes new state-of-the-art in NeRF-based multi-view 3D detection, verified with extensive experiments on ScanNet and ARKITScenes.

However, existing methods predominantly focus on synthesizing remote sensing (RS) images aligned with real images in a global layout view, which limits their applicability in RS image object detection (RSIOD) research. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-class and multi-scale object image generator based on DGMs, termed MMO-IG, designed to generate RS images with supervised object labels from global and local aspects simultaneously. Specifically, from the local view, MMO-IG encodes various RS instances using an iso-spacing instance map (ISIM). During the generation process, it decodes each instance region with iso-spacing value in ISIM-corresponding to both background and foreground instances-to produce RS images through the denoising process of diffusion models. Considering the complex interdependencies among MMOs, we construct a spatial-cross dependency knowledge graph (SCDKG). This ensures a realistic and reliable multidirectional distribution among MMOs for region embedding, thereby reducing the discrepancy between source and target domains. Besides, we propose a structured object distribution instruction (SODI) to guide the generation of synthesized RS image content from a global aspect with SCDKG-based ISIM together. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MMO-IG exhibits superior generation capabilities for RS images with dense MMO-supervised labels, and RS detectors pre-trained with MMO-IG show excellent performance on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its faces multiple real-world edge deployment challenges including limited high-quality annotated data, data sharing restrictions, and computational constraints. In this work, we introduce UltraFlwr, a framework for federated medical and surgical object detection. By leveraging Federated Learning (FL), UltraFlwr enables decentralized model training across multiple sites without sharing raw data. To further enhance UltraFlwr's efficiency, we propose YOLO-PA, a set of novel Partial Aggregation (PA) strategies specifically designed for YOLO models in FL. YOLO-PA significantly reduces communication overhead by up to 83% per round while maintaining performance comparable to Full Aggregation (FA) strategies. Our extensive experiments on BCCD and m2cai16-tool-locations datasets demonstrate that YOLO-PA not only provides better client models compared to client-wise centralized training and FA strategies, but also facilitates efficient training and deployment across resource-constrained edge devices. Further, we also establish one of the first benchmarks in federated medical and surgical object detection. This paper advances the feasibility of training and deploying detection models on the edge, making federated object detection more practical for time-critical and resource-constrained medical and surgical applications.

LiDAR sensors, widely used for their ability to provide detailed 3D measurements, are key to achieving this capability. However, variations between training and inference data can cause significant performance drops when object detection models are employed in different sensor settings. One critical factor is beam density, as inference on sparse, cost-effective LiDAR sensors is often preferred in real-world applications. Despite previous work addressing the beam-density-induced domain gap, substantial knowledge gaps remain, particularly concerning dense 128-beam sensors in cross-domain scenarios. To gain better understanding of the impact of beam density on domain gaps, we conduct a comprehensive investigation that includes an evaluation of different object detection architectures. Our architecture evaluation reveals that combining voxel- and point-based approaches yields superior cross-domain performance by leveraging the strengths of both representations. Building on these findings, we analyze beam-density-induced domain gaps and argue that these domain gaps must be evaluated in conjunction with other domain shifts. Contrary to conventional beliefs, our experiments reveal that detectors benefit from training on denser data and exhibit robustness to beam density variations during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVWW 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DEIM: DETR with Improved Matching for Fast Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04234v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DEIM, an innovative and efficient training framework designed to accelerate convergence in real-time object detection with Transformer-based architectures (DETR). To mitigate the sparse supervision inherent in one-to-one (O2O) matching in DETR models, DEIM employs a Dense O2O matching strategy. This approach increases the number of positive samples per image by incorporating additional targets, using standard data augmentation techniques. While Dense O2O matching speeds up convergence, it also introduces numerous low-quality matches that could affect performance. To address this, we propose the Matchability-Aware Loss (MAL), a novel loss function that optimizes matches across various quality levels, enhancing the effectiveness of Dense O2O. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset validate the efficacy of DEIM. When integrated with RT-DETR and D-FINE, it consistently boosts performance while reducing training time by 50%. Notably, paired with RT-DETRv2, DEIM achieves 53.2% AP in a single day of training on an NVIDIA 4090 GPU.

This process is indispensable for enhancing road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of the technological advancements in the automotive industry. This study introduces the Interaction of Autonomous and Manually-Controlled Vehicles (IAMCV) dataset, a novel and extensive dataset focused on inter-vehicle interactions. The dataset, enriched with a sophisticated array of sensors such as Light Detection and Ranging, cameras, Inertial Measurement Unit/Global Positioning System, and vehicle bus data acquisition, provides a comprehensive representation of real-world driving scenarios that include roundabouts, intersections, country roads, and highways, recorded across diverse locations in Germany. Furthermore, the study shows the versatility of the IAMCV dataset through several proof-of-concept use cases. Firstly, an unsupervised trajectory clustering algorithm illustrates the dataset's capability in categorizing vehicle movements without the need for labeled training data. Secondly, we compare an online camera calibration method with the Robot Operating System-based standard, using images captured in the dataset. Finally, a preliminary test employing the YOLOv8 object-detection model is conducted, augmented by reflections on the transferability of object detection across various LIDAR resolutions. These use cases underscore the practical utility of the collected dataset, emphasizing its potential to advance research and innovation in the area of intelligent vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose the task of domain generalized oriented object detection, which intends to explore the generalization of oriented object detectors on arbitrary unseen target domains. Learning domain generalized oriented object detectors is particularly challenging, as the cross-domain style variation not only negatively impacts the content representation, but also leads to unreliable orientation predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized oriented object detector (GOOD). After style hallucination by the emerging contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), it consists of two key components, namely, rotation-aware content consistency learning (RAC) and style consistency learning (SEC). The proposed RAC allows the oriented object detector to learn stable orientation representation from style-diversified samples. The proposed SEC further stabilizes the generalization ability of content representation from different image styles. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain settings show the state-of-the-art performance of GOOD. Source code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages. accepted by ISPRS</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Layer Attention Efficiency through Pruning Redundant Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06473v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Growing evidence suggests that layer attention mechanisms, which enhance interaction among layers in deep neural networks, have significantly advanced network architectures. However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30\% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks. We validated our system in real-world environments with varying degrees of manual modifications, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in long-term tasks.

While this description is crucial for distinguishing the target from visually similar instances in a scene, providing it prior to navigation can be demanding for human. To bridge this gap, we introduce Collaborative Instance object Navigation (CoIN), a new task setting where the agent actively resolve uncertainties about the target instance during navigation in natural, template-free, open-ended dialogues with human. We propose a novel training-free method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), which operates independently from the navigation policy, and focuses on the human-agent interaction reasoning with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue within the agent to obtain a complete and accurate observation description with a novel uncertainty estimation technique. Then, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the human, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input. For evaluation, we introduce CoIN-Bench, with a curated dataset designed for challenging multi-instance scenarios. CoIN-Bench supports both online evaluation with humans and reproducible experiments with simulated user-agent interactions. On CoIN-Bench, we show that AIUTA serves as a competitive baseline, while existing language-driven instance navigation methods struggle in complex multi-instance scenes.

Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of fusing radar and LiDAR point clouds. However, challenges remain due to the modality misalignment and information loss during feature extractions. To address these issues, we propose a 4D radar-LiDAR framework to mutually enhance their representations. Initially, the indicative features from radar are utilized to guide both radar and LiDAR geometric feature learning. Subsequently, to mitigate their sparsity gap, the shape information from LiDAR is used to enrich radar BEV features. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate our approach's superiority over existing methods, achieving the highest mAP of 71.76% across the entire area and 86.36\% within the driving corridor. Especially for cars, we improve the AP by 4.17% and 4.20% due to the strong indicative features and symmetric shapes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |

However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers, multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to perform "local and global" spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes, Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly, our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 | None |

Due to the hidden nature of camouflaged objects, it is essential for the decoder to be tailored to effectively extract proper features of camouflaged objects and extra-carefully generate their complex boundaries. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture that augments the prevalent decoding strategy in COD with Enrich Decoder and Retouch Decoder, which help to generate a fine-grained segmentation map. Specifically, the Enrich Decoder amplifies the channels of features that are important for COD using channel-wise attention. Retouch Decoder further refines the segmentation maps by spatially attending to important pixels, such as the boundary regions. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ENTO shows superior performance using various encoders, with the two novel components playing their unique roles that are mutually complementary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMVC 2024, 13 pages, 7 figures (Appendix: 5 pages, 2 figures)</p></details> | None |

Simulations show that this SPMT can be integrated into an opto-electronic joint transform correlator to create a correlation system capable of detecting multiple objects simultaneously, presenting robust detection capabilities across various transformation conditions, with remarkable discrimination between matching and non-matching targets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LEGNet: Lightweight Edge-Gaussian Driven Network for Low-Quality Remote Sensing Image Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14012v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing object detection (RSOD) faces formidable challenges in complex visual environments. Aerial and satellite images inherently suffer from limitations such as low spatial resolution, sensor noise, blurred objects, low-light degradation, and partial occlusions. These degradation factors collectively compromise the feature discriminability in detection models, resulting in three key issues: (1) reduced contrast that hampers foreground-background separation, (2) structural discontinuities in edge representations, and (3) ambiguous feature responses caused by variations in illumination. These collectively weaken model robustness and deployment feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose LEGNet, a lightweight network that incorporates a novel edge-Gaussian aggregation (EGA) module specifically designed for low-quality remote sensing images. Our key innovation lies in the synergistic integration of Scharr operator-based edge priors with uncertainty-aware Gaussian modeling: (a) The orientation-aware Scharr filters preserve high-frequency edge details with rotational invariance; (b) The uncertainty-aware Gaussian layers probabilistically refine low-confidence features through variance estimation. This design enables precision enhancement while maintaining architectural simplicity. Comprehensive evaluations across four RSOD benchmarks (DOTA-v1.0, v1.5, DIOR-R, FAIR1M-v1.0) and a UAV-view dataset (VisDrone2019) demonstrate significant improvements. LEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets while ensuring computational efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices in real-world remote sensing applications.

Driven by the motivation that streamlining the infrared flow and harnessing PVMs with fewer parameters for superior performance, we propose "IV-tuning", a novel and general fine-tuning approach, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various infrared-visible downstream tasks. At its core, IV-tuning freezes pre-trained visible-based PVMs and integrates infrared flow into modal prompts to interact with adapters, which achieves a more efficient and general modal interaction paradigm. By fine-tuning approximately 3% of the backbone parameters, IV-tuning outperforms full fine-tuning and previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple baselines in multiple tasks, including IR-VIS salient object detection, semantic segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IV-tuning achieves superior performance with fewer trainable parameters, providing a good alternative to full fine-tuning and a novel method of extending visible-based models for infrared-visible tasks.

Initially, we utilize the results of image-based two-dimensional object detection to narrow down the search region in the three-dimensional space of the point cloud. Next, we introduce a Gaussian mask to enhance the point cloud information. Then, we extract the features from the frustum point cloud and the crop image using the point cloud feature extraction pipeline and the image feature extraction pipeline, respectively. Finally, we concatenate and fuse the data features from both modalities to achieve three-dimensional object detection. Experiments demonstrate that on the constructed test set of tractor road data, the FrustumFusionNetv2 achieves 82.28% and 95.68% accuracy in the three-dimensional object detection of the two main road objects, cars and people, respectively. This performance is 1.83% and 2.33% better than the original model. It offers a hybrid fusion-based multi-object, high-precision, real-time three-dimensional object detection technique for unmanned agricultural machines in tractor road scenarios. On the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) Benchmark Suite validation set, the FrustumFusionNetv2 also demonstrates significant superiority in detecting road pedestrian objects compared with other frustum-based three-dimensional object detection methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Is Discretization Fusion All You Need for Collaborative Perception?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13946v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception in multi-agent system enhances overall perceptual capabilities by facilitating the exchange of complementary information among agents. Current mainstream collaborative perception methods rely on discretized feature maps to conduct fusion, which however, lacks flexibility in extracting and transmitting the informative features and can hardly focus on the informative features during fusion. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel Anchor-Centric paradigm for Collaborative Object detection (ACCO). It avoids grid precision issues and allows more flexible and efficient anchor-centric communication and fusion. ACCO is composed by three main components: (1) Anchor featuring block (AFB) that targets to generate anchor proposals and projects prepared anchor queries to image features. (2) Anchor confidence generator (ACG) is designed to minimize communication by selecting only the features in the confident anchors to transmit. (3) A local-global fusion module, in which local fusion is anchor alignment-based fusion (LAAF) and global fusion is conducted by spatial-aware cross-attention (SACA). LAAF and SACA run in multi-layers, so agents conduct anchor-centric fusion iteratively to adjust the anchor proposals. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate ACCO on OPV2V and Dair-V2X datasets, which demonstrate ACCO's superiority in reducing the communication volume, and in improving the perception range and detection performances.

However, recent SSL approaches fail to define pretext tasks that retain geometric information such as object pose and scale, which can be detrimental to the performance of downstream localization and geometry-sensitive 3D scene understanding tasks, such as 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We propose PSA-SSL, a novel extension to point cloud SSL that learns object pose and size-aware (PSA) features. Our approach defines a self-supervised bounding box regression pretext task, which retains object pose and size information. Furthermore, we incorporate LiDAR beam pattern augmentation on input point clouds, which encourages learning sensor-agnostic features. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single pretrained model, our light-weight yet effective extensions achieve significant improvements on 3D semantic segmentation with limited labels across popular autonomous driving datasets (Waymo, nuScenes, SemanticKITTI). Moreover, our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art SSL methods on 3D semantic segmentation (using up to 10 times less labels), as well as on 3D object detection. Our code will be released on https://github.com/TRAILab/PSA-SSL.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TRAILab/PSA-SSL) |

Hyperspectral images provide a promising solution for more accurate Hyperspectral Salient Object Detection (HSOD) by abundant spectral information, while HSOD methods are hindered by the lack of extensive and available datasets. In this context, we introduce HSOD-BIT-V2, the largest and most challenging HSOD benchmark dataset to date. Five distinct challenges focusing on small objects and foreground-background similarity are designed to emphasize spectral advantages and real-world complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hyper-HRNet, a high-resolution HSOD network. Hyper-HRNet effectively extracts, integrates, and preserves effective spectral information while reducing dimensionality by capturing the self-similar spectral features. Additionally, it conveys fine details and precisely locates object contours by incorporating comprehensive global information and detailed object saliency representations. Experimental analysis demonstrates that Hyper-HRNet outperforms existing models, especially in challenging scenarios.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |

Typically, CNNs excel at capturing local features but struggle to model global representations. Conversely, ViTs are adept at capturing long-range global features but face challenges in representing local feature details. Off-the-shelf video object detection methods solely rely on CNNs or ViTs to conduct feature aggregation, which hampers their capability to simultaneously leverage global and local information, thereby resulting in limited detection performance. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-GraphFormer Blender Network (TGBFormer) for video object detection, with three key technical improvements to fully exploit the advantages of transformers and graph convolutional networks while compensating for their limitations. First, we develop a spatial-temporal transformer module to aggregate global contextual information, constituting global representations with long-range feature dependencies. Second, we introduce a spatial-temporal GraphFormer module that utilizes local spatial and temporal relationships to aggregate features, generating new local representations that are complementary to the transformer outputs. Third, we design a global-local feature blender module to adaptively couple transformer-based global representations and GraphFormer-based local representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TGBFormer establishes new state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet VID dataset. Particularly, our TGBFormer achieves 86.5% mAP while running at around 41.0 FPS on a single Tesla A100 GPU.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 | None |

To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. Firstly, we introduce the High-Resolution Feature Map for Small Object Detection (HRFM-TOD) module to address indistinct small-object features in low-light scenarios. By leveraging high-resolution feature maps, HRFM-TOD effectively mitigates the feature dilution problem encountered in conventional PANet frameworks, thereby enhancing both detection accuracy and inference speed. Secondly, we develop the Multi-branch Feature Interaction Attention (MFIA) module, which facilitates deep feature interaction across multiple receptive fields in both channel and spatial dimensions, significantly improving the model's information extraction capabilities. Finally, we propose the Prior-Guided Enhancement Module (PGFE) to tackle common image quality challenges in low-light environments, such as noise, low contrast, and blurriness. This module employs prior knowledge to enrich image details and enhance visibility, substantially boosting detection performance. To support this research, we construct a novel dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios, including urban, highway, and rural environments under varying weather conditions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, and achieving superior results on the CCTSDB2021 dataset.

However, this may lead to biased synthetic data and overfitting to specific configurations. It can sidestep biases of manually curated data generation by directly leveraging hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs), which is surprisingly rarely explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of a MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge transfer from LLMs to object detectors, an new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We demonstrate that intermediate hidden states from early LLM layers retain strong spatial-semantic correlations that are beneficial to grounding tasks. Experiments show that our adaptation strategy significantly enhances the performance on complex free-form text queries while remaining the same on plain categories. With our adaptation, Qwen2-0.5B with Swin-T as the vision encoder improves GroundingDINO by 2.33% on Omnilabel, at the overhead of 8.7% more GFLOPs. Qwen2-0.5B with a larger vision encoder can further boost the performance by 6.22%. We further validate our design by ablating on varied adapter architectures, sizes of LLMs, and which layers to add adaptation.</p></details> |  | None |

The dataset comprises a 1-hour video (67,760 frames) of eight Holstein Friesian calves in a barn, with ground truth bounding boxes and identities, alongside 900 static frames for detection tasks. Each calf exhibits a unique coat pattern, enabling precise identity distinction. For cow detection, we fine-tuned 28 models (25 YOLO variants, 3 transformers) on 600 frames, testing on the full video. Results reveal smaller YOLO models (e.g., YOLOV9c) outperform larger counterparts despite potential bias from a YOLOv8m-based labeling pipeline. For identity classification, embeddings from 23 pretrained vision models (ResNet, ConvNextV2, ViTs) were evaluated via linear classifiers and KNN. Modern architectures like ConvNextV2 excelled, while larger models frequently overfit, highlighting inefficiencies in scaling. Key findings include: (1) Minimal, targeted augmentations (e.g., rotation) outperform complex strategies on simpler datasets; (2) Pretraining strategies (e.g., BEiT, DinoV2) significantly boost identity recognition; (3) Temporal continuity and natural motion patterns offer unique challenges absent in synthetic or domain-specific benchmarks. The dataset's controlled design and extended sequences (1 hour vs. prior 10-minute benchmarks) make it a pragmatic tool for stress-testing occlusion handling, temporal consistency, and efficiency.

Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) methods have recently demonstrated strong results on addressing this challenge. Unfortunately, we identify systemic benchmarking pitfalls that call past results into question and hamper further progress: (a) Overestimation of performance due to underpowered baselines, (b) Inconsistent implementation practices preventing transparent comparisons of methods, and (c) Lack of generality due to outdated backbones and lack of diversity in benchmarks. We address these problems by introducing: (1) A unified benchmarking and implementation framework, Align and Distill (ALDI), enabling comparison of DAOD methods and supporting future development, (2) A fair and modern training and evaluation protocol for DAOD that addresses benchmarking pitfalls, (3) A new DAOD benchmark dataset, CFC-DAOD, enabling evaluation on diverse real-world data, and (4) A new method, ALDI++, that achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin. ALDI++ outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by +3.5 AP50 on Cityscapes to Foggy Cityscapes, +5.7 AP50 on Sim10k to Cityscapes (where ours is the only method to outperform a fair baseline), and +0.6 AP50 on CFC Kenai to Channel.

It represents the first comprehensive experimental evaluation of YOLOv3 to the latest version, YOLOv12, on various object detection challenges. The challenges considered include varying object sizes, diverse aspect ratios, and small-sized objects of a single class, ensuring a comprehensive assessment across datasets with distinct challenges. To ensure a robust evaluation, we employ a comprehensive set of metrics, including Precision, Recall, Mean Average Precision (mAP), Processing Time, GFLOPs count, and Model Size. Our analysis highlights the distinctive strengths and limitations of each YOLO version. For example: YOLOv9 demonstrates substantial accuracy but struggles with detecting small objects and efficiency whereas YOLOv10 exhibits relatively lower accuracy due to architectural choices that affect its performance in overlapping object detection but excels in speed and efficiency. Additionally, the YOLO11 family consistently shows superior performance maintaining a remarkable balance of accuracy and efficiency. However, YOLOv12 delivered underwhelming results, with its complex architecture introducing computational overhead without significant performance gains. These results provide critical insights for both industry and academia, facilitating the selection of the most suitable YOLO algorithm for diverse applications and guiding future enhancements.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |
| **[Quantifying the Reliability of Predictions in Detection Transformers: Object-Level Calibration and Image-Level Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01782v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DEtection TRansformer (DETR) has emerged as a promising architecture for object detection, offering an end-to-end prediction pipeline. In practice, however, DETR generates hundreds of predictions that far outnumber the actual number of objects present in an image. This raises the question: can we trust and use all of these predictions? Addressing this concern, we present empirical evidence highlighting how different predictions within the same image play distinct roles, resulting in varying reliability levels across those predictions. More specifically, while multiple predictions are often made for a single object, our findings show that most often one such prediction is well-calibrated, and the others are poorly calibrated. Based on these insights, we demonstrate that identifying a reliable subset of DETR's predictions is crucial for accurately assessing the reliability of the model at both object and image levels. Building on this viewpoint, we first address the shortcomings of widely used performance and calibration metrics, such as average precision and various forms of expected calibration error. Specifically, they are inadequate for determining which subset of DETR's predictions should be trusted and utilized. In response, we present Object-level Calibration Error (OCE), which assesses the calibration quality more effectively and is suitable for both ranking different models and identifying the most reliable predictions within a specific model. As a final contribution, we introduce a post hoc uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework that predicts the accuracy of the model on a per-image basis. By contrasting the average confidence scores of positive (i.e., likely to be matched) and negative predictions determined by OCE, our framework assesses the reliability of the DETR model for each test image.</p></details> |  | None |

While using latent diffusion models (LDMs) show promise in augmenting limited source data, we demonstrate that directly using synthetic data can be detrimental due to significant feature distribution discrepancies between synthetic and real target domains, leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Discriminative Domain Reassembly and Soft-Fusion (DRSF), a training framework leveraging synthetic data to improve model generalization. We employ LDMs to produce diverse pseudo-target domain samples and introduce two key modules to handle distribution bias. First, Discriminative Feature Decoupling and Reassembly (DFDR) module uses entropy-guided attention to recalibrate channel-level features, suppressing synthetic noise while preserving semantic consistency. Second, Multi-pseudo-domain Soft Fusion (MDSF) module uses adversarial training with latent-space feature interpolation, creating continuous feature transitions between domains. Extensive SDG experiments on object detection and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that DRSF achieves substantial performance gains with only marginal computational overhead. Notably, DRSF's plug-and-play architecture enables seamless integration with unsupervised domain adaptation paradigms, underscoring its broad applicability in addressing diverse and real-world domain challenges.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Dual-Domain Homogeneous Fusion with Cross-Modal Mamba and Progressive Decoder for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08992v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fusing LiDAR and image features in a homogeneous BEV domain has become popular for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. However, this paradigm is constrained by the excessive feature compression. While some works explore dense voxel fusion to enable better feature interaction, they face high computational costs and challenges in query generation. Additionally, feature misalignment in both domains results in suboptimal detection accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a Dual-Domain Homogeneous Fusion network (DDHFusion), which leverages the complementarily of both BEV and voxel domains while mitigating their drawbacks. Specifically, we first transform image features into BEV and sparse voxel representations using lift-splat-shot and our proposed Semantic-Aware Feature Sampling (SAFS) module. The latter significantly reduces computational overhead by discarding unimportant voxels. Next, we introduce Homogeneous Voxel and BEV Fusion (HVF and HBF) networks for multi-modal fusion within respective domains. They are equipped with novel cross-modal Mamba blocks to resolve feature misalignment and enable comprehensive scene perception. The output voxel features are injected into the BEV space to compensate for the information loss brought by direct height compression. During query selection, the Progressive Query Generation (PQG) mechanism is implemented in the BEV domain to reduce false negatives caused by feature compression. Furthermore, we propose a Progressive Decoder (QD) that sequentially aggregates not only context-rich BEV features but also geometry-aware voxel features with deformable attention and the Multi-Modal Voxel Feature Mixing (MMVFM) block for precise classification and box regression.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Beyond RGB: Adaptive Parallel Processing for RAW Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13163v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models are typically applied to standard RGB images processed through Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines, which are designed to enhance sensor-captured RAW images for human vision. However, these ISP functions can lead to a loss of critical information that may be essential in optimizing for computer vision tasks, such as object detection. In this work, we introduce Raw Adaptation Module (RAM), a module designed to replace the traditional ISP, with parameters optimized specifically for RAW object detection. Inspired by the parallel processing mechanisms of the human visual system, RAM departs from existing learned ISP methods by applying multiple ISP functions in parallel rather than sequentially, allowing for a more comprehensive capture of image features. These processed representations are then fused in a specialized module, which dynamically integrates and optimizes the information for the target task. This novel approach not only leverages the full potential of RAW sensor data but also enables task-specific pre-processing, resulting in superior object detection performance. Our approach outperforms RGB-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse RAW image datasets under varying lighting conditions and dynamic ranges.</p></details> |  | None |

The study employs YOLOv8 and repurposed U-Net, two advanced deep learning models, to significantly enhance ship detection accuracy. Evaluation metrics include Mean Average Precision (mAP), processing speed, and overall accuracy. The research utilizes the "Airbus Ship Detection" dataset, featuring diverse remote sensing images, to assess the models' versatility in detecting ships with varying orientations and environmental contexts. Conventional ship detection faces challenges with arbitrary orientations, complex backgrounds, and obscured perspectives. Our approach incorporates YOLOv8 for real-time processing and U-Net for ship instance segmentation. Evaluation focuses on mAP, processing speed, and overall accuracy.

This study introduces the novel tasks of 2D, 2.5D and 3D unobserved object detection for predicting the location of nearby objects that are occluded or lie outside the image frame. We adapt several state-of-the-art pre-trained generative models to address this task, including 2D and 3D diffusion models and vision-language models, and show that they can be used to infer the presence of objects that are not directly observed. To benchmark this task, we propose a suite of metrics that capture different aspects of performance. Our empirical evaluation on indoor scenes from the RealEstate10k and NYU Depth v2 datasets demonstrate results that motivate the use of generative models for the unobserved object detection task.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025; 22 pages</p></details> | None |

Despite the success of previous works on cooperative object detection, they mostly operate on dense Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature maps, which are computationally demanding and can hardly be extended to long-range detection problems. More efficient fully sparse frameworks are rarely explored. In this work, we design a fully sparse framework, SparseAlign, with three key features: an enhanced sparse 3D backbone, a query-based temporal context learning module, and a robust detection head specially tailored for sparse features. Extensive experimental results on both OPV2V and DairV2X datasets show that our framework, despite its sparsity, outperforms the state of the art with less communication bandwidth requirements. In addition, experiments on the OPV2Vt and DairV2Xt datasets for time-aligned cooperative object detection also show a significant performance gain compared to the baseline works.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the inherent heterogeneity between these modalities, including unbalanced convergence and modal misalignment, poses significant challenges. Meanwhile, the large size of the detection-oriented feature also constrains existing fusion strategies to capture long-range dependencies for the 3D detection tasks. In this work, we introduce a fast yet effective multimodal 3D object detector, incorporating our proposed Instance-level Contrastive Distillation (ICD) framework and Cross Linear Attention Fusion Module (CLFM). ICD aligns instance-level image features with LiDAR representations through object-aware contrastive distillation, ensuring fine-grained cross-modal consistency. Meanwhile, CLFM presents an efficient and scalable fusion strategy that enhances cross-modal global interactions within sizable multimodal BEV features. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes 3D object detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Notably, our 3D object detector outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while achieving superior efficiency.

While existing OWOD methods primarily focus on detecting unknown objects, they often overlook the rich semantic relationships between detected objects, which are essential for scene understanding and applications in open-world environments (e.g., open-world tracking and novel class discovery). In this paper, we extend the OWOD framework to jointly detect unknown objects and learn semantically rich instance embeddings, enabling the detector to capture fine-grained semantic relationships between instances. To this end, we propose two modules that leverage the rich and generalizable knowledge of Vision Foundation Models(VFM). First, the Unknown Box Refine Module uses instance masks from the Segment Anything Model to accurately localize unknown objects. The Embedding Transfer Module then distills instance-wise semantic similarities from VFM features to the detector's embeddings via a relaxed contrastive loss, enabling the detector to learn a semantically meaningful and generalizable instance feature. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves both unknown object detection and instance embedding quality, while also enhancing performance in downstream tasks such as open-world tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website can be found at https://sunohlee.github.io/OW-Rep/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://sunohlee.github.io/OW-Rep) |

This paper focuses on detecting pavement marking quality during daytime using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, leveraging its advanced architectural features to enhance road safety through precise and real-time assessments. Utilizing image data from New Jersey, this study employed three YOLOv8 variants: YOLOv8m, YOLOv8n, and YOLOv8x. The models were evaluated based on their prediction accuracy for classifying pavement markings into good, moderate, and poor visibility categories. The results demonstrated that YOLOv8n provides the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving the highest mean Average Precision (mAP) for objects with good visibility and demonstrating robust performance across various Intersections over Union (IoU) thresholds. This research enhances transportation safety by offering an automated and accurate method for evaluating the quality of pavement markings.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at IEEE CAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Point Cloud Based Scene Segmentation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12595v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving is a safety-critical application, and it is therefore a top priority that the accompanying assistance systems are able to provide precise information about the surrounding environment of the vehicle. Tasks such as 3D Object Detection deliver an insufficiently detailed understanding of the surrounding scene because they only predict a bounding box for foreground objects. In contrast, 3D Semantic Segmentation provides richer and denser information about the environment by assigning a label to each individual point, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving tasks, such as navigation or lane changes. To inspire future research, in this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art methods in the field of Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for autonomous driving. We categorize the approaches into projection-based, 3D-based and hybrid methods. Moreover, we discuss the most important and commonly used datasets for this task and also emphasize the importance of synthetic data to support research when real-world data is limited. We further present the results of the different methods and compare them with respect to their segmentation accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

While human vision adapts dynamically to environmental conditions, computational dehazing does not always enhance detection uniformly. We propose a multi-stage framework where a lightweight detector identifies regions of interest (RoIs), which are then improved via spatial attention-based dehazing before final detection by a heavier model. Though effective in foggy conditions, this approach unexpectedly degrades the performance on clear images. We analyze this phenomenon, investigate possible causes, and offer insights for designing hybrid pipelines that balance enhancement and detection. Our findings highlight the need for selective preprocessing and challenge assumptions about universal benefits from cascading transformations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p></details> |  | None |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

Manual processing remains error-prone and time-consuming, while current automated solutions are limited by their inability to support a variety of constraints, such as documents that are partially handwritten or photographed with a mobile phone. In this paper, we propose to automate the validation of machine written invoices using document layout analysis and object detection techniques based on recent deep learning (DL) models. We introduce a novel dataset consisting of manually annotated real-world invoices and a multi-criteria validation process. We fine-tune and benchmark the most relevant DL models on our dataset. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline and selected DL models in terms of achieving fast and accurate validation of invoices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Minuscule Cell Detection in AS-OCT Images with Progressive Field-of-View Focusing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12249v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) is an emerging imaging technique with great potential for diagnosing anterior uveitis, a vision-threatening ocular inflammatory condition. A hallmark of this condition is the presence of inflammatory cells in the eye's anterior chamber, and detecting these cells using AS-OCT images has attracted research interest. While recent efforts aim to replace manual cell detection with automated computer vision approaches, detecting extremely small (minuscule) objects in high-resolution images, such as AS-OCT, poses substantial challenges: (1) each cell appears as a minuscule particle, representing less than 0.005\% of the image, making the detection difficult, and (2) OCT imaging introduces pixel-level noise that can be mistaken for cells, leading to false positive detections. To overcome these challenges, we propose a minuscule cell detection framework through a progressive field-of-view focusing strategy. This strategy systematically refines the detection scope from the whole image to a target region where cells are likely to be present, and further to minuscule regions potentially containing individual cells. Our framework consists of two modules. First, a Field-of-Focus module uses a vision foundation model to segment the target region. Subsequently, a Fine-grained Object Detection module introduces a specialized Minuscule Region Proposal followed by a Spatial Attention Network to distinguish individual cells from noise within the segmented region. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cell detection, providing enhanced efficacy for clinical applications.

While traditional sparse convolution techniques efficiently capture local structures, they struggle with modeling long-range relationships. However, capturing long-range dependencies is fundamental for 3D object detection. In contrast, transformers are designed to capture these long-range dependencies through attention mechanisms. But, they come with high computational costs, due to their quadratic query-key-value interactions. Furthermore, directly applying attention to non-empty voxels is inefficient due to the sparse nature of 3D scenes. Our SFMNet is built on a novel Sparse Focal Modulation (SFM) module, which integrates short- and long-range contexts with linear complexity by leveraging a new hierarchical sparse convolution design. This approach enables SFMNet to achieve high detection performance with improved efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale LiDAR scenes. We show that our detector achieves state-of-the-art performance on autonomous driving datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 | None |

Existing approaches typically predict 3D translation utilizing the ground-truth object bounding box and approximate 3D rotation with a large number of discrete hypotheses. This strategy makes unrealistic assumptions about the availability of ground truth and incurs a computationally expensive process of scoring each hypothesis at test time. By contrast, we rethink the problem of relative pose estimation for unseen objects by presenting a Deep Voxel Matching Network (DVMNet++). Our method computes the relative object pose in a single pass, eliminating the need for ground-truth object bounding boxes and rotation hypotheses. We achieve open-set object detection by leveraging image feature embedding and natural language understanding as reference. The detection result is then employed to approximate the translation parameters and crop the object from the query image. For rotation estimation, we map the two RGB images, i.e., reference and cropped query, to their respective voxelized 3D representations. The resulting voxels are passed through a rotation estimation module, which aligns the voxels and computes the rotation in an end-to-end fashion by solving a least-squares problem. To enhance robustness, we introduce a weighted closest voxel algorithm capable of mitigating the impact of noisy voxels. We conduct extensive experiments on the CO3D, Objaverse, LINEMOD, and LINEMOD-O datasets, demonstrating that our approach delivers more accurate relative pose estimates for novel objects at a lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released at https://github.com/sailor-z/DVMNet/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/sailor-z/DVMNet) |

Extensive research is dedicated to the RGB-IR object detection, primarily focusing on how to integrate complementary features from RGB-IR modalities. However, they neglect the mono-modality insufficient learning problem that the decreased feature extraction capability in multi-modal joint learning. This leads to an unreasonable but prevalent phenomenon--Fusion Degradation, which hinders the performance improvement of the MMOD model. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce linear probing evaluation to the multi-modal detectors and rethink the multi-modal object detection task from the mono-modality learning perspective. Therefore, we construct an novel framework called M$^2$D-LIF, which consists of the Mono-Modality Distillation (M$^2$D) method and the Local Illumination-aware Fusion (LIF) module. The M$^2$D-LIF framework facilitates the sufficient learning of mono-modality during multi-modal joint training and explores a lightweight yet effective feature fusion manner to achieve superior object detection performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three MMOD datasets demonstrate that our M$^2$D-LIF effectively mitigates the Fusion Degradation phenomenon and outperforms the previous SOTA detectors.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

More recently, researchers have used machine learning methods to speed up the process. However, for small particles in large sample volumes the performance of these methods falls short of standard physics-based reconstruction methods. Here we designed a two-stage neural network architecture, FLASH$\mu$, to detect small particles (6-100$\mu$m) from holograms with large sample depths up to 20cm. Trained only on synthetic data with added physical noise, our method reliably detects particles of at least 9$\mu$m diameter in real holograms, comparable to the standard reconstruction-based approaches while operating on smaller crops, at quarter of the original resolution and providing roughly a 600-fold speedup. In addition to introducing a novel approach to a non-local object detection or signal demixing problem, our work could enable low-cost, real-time holographic imaging setups.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable the student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different learning stages of KD. KD is a continuous process, but when adjusting the temperature, these methods consider only the immediate benefits of the operation in the current learning phase and fail to take into account its future returns. To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of temperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on reinforcement learning, termed RLKD. Importantly, we design a novel state representation to enable the agent to make more informed action (i.e. instance temperature adjustment). To handle the problem of delayed rewards in our method due to the KD setting, we explore an instance reward calibration approach. In addition,we devise an efficient exploration strategy that enables the agent to learn valuable instance temperature adjustment policy more efficiently. Our framework can serve as a plug-and-play technique to be inserted into various KD methods easily, and we validate its effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks.

To this end, we provide the large, high-resolution dataset MAD comprising 105 labeled images with 14,667 annotated apple instances and 4,440 unlabeled images. Utilizing this dataset, we also propose a novel Semi-Supervised Small Apple Detection system S$^3$AD based on contextual attention and selective tiling to improve the challenging detection of small apples, while limiting the computational overhead. We conduct an extensive evaluation on MAD and the MSU dataset, showing that S$^3$AD substantially outperforms strong fully-supervised baselines, including several small object detection systems, by up to $14.9\%$. Additionally, we exploit the detailed annotations of our dataset w.r.t. apple properties to analyze the influence of relative size or level of occlusion on the results of various systems, quantifying current challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2024.

Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</p></details> | Under Review | [Code Link](https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon) |

Backdoor attacks, in particular, pose a serious threat by implanting hidden triggers in victim models, which adversaries can later exploit to induce malicious behaviors during inference. However, current understanding is limited to single-target attacks, where adversaries must define a fixed malicious behavior (target) before training, making inference-time adaptability impossible. Given the large output space of object detection (including object existence prediction, bounding box estimation, and classification), the feasibility of flexible, inference-time model control remains unexplored. This paper introduces AnywhereDoor, a multi-target backdoor attack for object detection. Once implanted, AnywhereDoor allows adversaries to make objects disappear, fabricate new ones, or mislabel them, either across all object classes or specific ones, offering an unprecedented degree of control. This flexibility is enabled by three key innovations: (i) objective disentanglement to scale the number of supported targets; (ii) trigger mosaicking to ensure robustness even against region-based detectors; and (iii) strategic batching to address object-level data imbalances that hinder manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnywhereDoor grants attackers a high degree of control, improving attack success rates by 26% compared to adaptations of existing methods for such flexible control.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages; This update was mistakenly uploaded as a new manuscript on arXiv (2503.06529).

| **[Multi-Knowledge-oriented Nighttime Haze Imaging Enhancer for Vision-driven Intelligent Transportation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07351v3)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality and hinder reliable object detection in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-knowledge-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MKoIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MKoIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead to meet the requirements of real-time ITS deployment. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MKoIE surpasses existing methods, enhancing the reliability, accuracy, and operational efficiency of ITS.

Existing methods mainly rely on spatial local features, failing to capture global information, while Transformers increase computational costs.To address this, the Frequency-Assisted Mamba-Like Linear Attention Network (FMNet) is proposed, which leverages frequency-domain learning to efficiently capture global features and mitigate ambiguity between objects and the background. FMNet introduces the Multi-Scale Frequency-Assisted Mamba-Like Linear Attention (MFM) module, integrating frequency and spatial features through a multi-scale structure to handle scale variations while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, the Pyramidal Frequency Attention Extraction (PFAE) module and the Frequency Reverse Decoder (FRD) enhance semantics and reconstruct features. Experimental results demonstrate that FMNet outperforms existing methods on multiple COD datasets, showcasing its advantages in both performance and efficiency.

However, to mitigate the misalignment between upstream image-text pretraining and downstream region-level perception, additional supervisions are indispensable, eg, image-text pairs or pseudo annotations generated via self-training strategies. In this work, we propose CCKT-Det trained without any extra supervision. The proposed framework constructs a cyclic and dynamic knowledge transfer from language queries and visual region features extracted from VLMs, which forces the detector to closely align with the visual-semantic space of VLMs. Specifically, 1) we prefilter and inject semantic priors to guide the learning of queries, and 2) introduce a regional contrastive loss to improve the awareness of queries on novel objects. CCKT-Det can consistently improve performance as the scale of VLMs increases, all while requiring the detector at a moderate level of computation overhead. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance gain of +2.9% and +10.2% AP50 over previous state-of-the-arts on the challenging COCO benchmark, both without and with a stronger teacher model.

Despite considerable progress in removing hand-crafted components and simplifying the architecture with transformers, multi-scale feature maps and pyramid designs remain a key factor for their empirical success. In this paper, we show that shifting the multiscale inductive bias into the attention mechanism can work well, resulting in a plain detector `SimPLR' whose backbone and detection head are both non-hierarchical and operate on single-scale features. We find through our experiments that SimPLR with scale-aware attention is plain and simple architecture, yet competitive with multi-scale vision transformer alternatives. Compared to the multi-scale and single-scale state-of-the-art, our model scales better with bigger capacity (self-supervised) models and more pre-training data, allowing us to report a consistently better accuracy and faster runtime for object detection, instance segmentation, as well as panoptic segmentation.

This emergent ability enables zero-shot object detection and segmentation, using techniques that rely on text-image attention maps, without necessarily training on abundant labeled segmentation datasets. However, performance of such methods depends heavily on prompt engineering and manually selected layers or head choices for the attention layers. In this work, we demonstrate that, rather than relying solely on textual prompts, providing a single visual example for each category and fine-tuning the text-to-image attention layers and embeddings significantly improves the performance. Additionally, we propose learning an ensemble through few-shot fine-tuning across multiple layers and/or prompts. An entropy-based ranking and selection mechanism for text-to-image attention layers is proposed to identify the top-performing layers without the need for segmentation labels. This eliminates the need for hyper-parameter selection of text-to-image attention layers, providing a more flexible and scalable solution for open-vocabulary segmentation. We show that this approach yields strong zero-shot performance, further enhanced through fine-tuning with a single visual example. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method and findings are general and can be applied across various vision-language models (VLMs).</p></details> |  | None |

It expands the perception range of autonomous vehicles, enhances the road safety. Previous methods focused on predicting per-pixel height rather than depth, making significant gains in roadside visual perception. While it is limited by the perspective property of near-large and far-small on image features, making it difficult for network to understand real dimension of objects in the 3D world. BEV features and voxel features present the real distribution of objects in 3D world compared to the image features. However, BEV features tend to lose details due to the lack of explicit height information, and voxel features are computationally expensive. Inspired by this insight, an efficient framework learning height prediction in voxel features via transformer is proposed, dubbed HeightFormer. It groups the voxel features into local height sequences, and utilize attention mechanism to obtain height distribution prediction. Subsequently, the local height sequences are reassembled to generate accurate 3D features. The proposed method is applied to two large-scale roadside benchmarks, DAIR-V2X-I and Rope3D. Extensive experiments are performed and the HeightFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in roadside vision centric 3D object detection task.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing roadside perception methods concentrate on model design but overlook data issues like calibration errors, sparse information, and multi-view consistency, leading to poor performance on recent published datasets. To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70. RoCo-Sim fills a critical gap in roadside perception simulation.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/RoMA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/MiliLab/RoMA) |

The impact of, e.g., complex background structures with similar appearances as the objects of interest, on the detection accuracy and, beforehand, the necessary dataset composition are topics of ongoing research. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of background influences and different features of the object to be detected. The latter includes various materials and surfaces, partially transparent and with shiny reflections in the context of an Industry 4.0 learning factory. Different YOLOv8 models have been trained for each of the materials on different sized datasets, where the appearance was the only changing parameter. In the end, similar characteristics tend to show different behaviours and sometimes unexpected results. While some background components tend to be detected, others with the same features are not part of the detection. Additionally, some more precise conclusions can be drawn from the results. Therefore, we contribute a challenging dataset with detailed investigations on 92 trained YOLO models, addressing some issues on the detection accuracy and possible overfitting.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel $\textbf{T}$raffic-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{R}$adar $\textbf{S}$cene flow estimation method, named $\textbf{TARS}$, which utilizes the motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. Therefrom, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space, enabling a holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Hierarchical Semantic Distillation Framework for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10152v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) aims to detect objects beyond the training annotations, where detectors are usually aligned to a pre-trained vision-language model, eg, CLIP, to inherit its generalizable recognition ability so that detectors can recognize new or novel objects. However, previous works directly align the feature space with CLIP and fail to learn the semantic knowledge effectively. In this work, we propose a hierarchical semantic distillation framework named HD-OVD to construct a comprehensive distillation process, which exploits generalizable knowledge from the CLIP model in three aspects. In the first hierarchy of HD-OVD, the detector learns fine-grained instance-wise semantics from the CLIP image encoder by modeling relations among single objects in the visual space. Besides, we introduce text space novel-class-aware classification to help the detector assimilate the highly generalizable class-wise semantics from the CLIP text encoder, representing the second hierarchy. Lastly, abundant image-wise semantics containing multi-object and their contexts are also distilled by an image-wise contrastive distillation. Benefiting from the elaborated semantic distillation in triple hierarchies, our HD-OVD inherits generalizable recognition ability from CLIP in instance, class, and image levels. Thus, we boost the novel AP on the OV-COCO dataset to 46.4% with a ResNet50 backbone, which outperforms others by a clear margin. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to analyze how each component works.</p></details> | Accepted to TMM 2025 | None |

It has also been used to measure leaf area index and total leaf area. Some studies have used hand-held cameras, image processing 3D reconstruction and unsupervised learning-based methods to estimate the leaf area in plant images. Deep learning works well for object detection and segmentation tasks; however, direct area estimation of objects has not been explored. This work investigates deep learning-based leaf area estimation, for RGBD images taken using a mobile camera setup in real-world scenarios. A dataset for attached leaves captured with a top angle view and a dataset for detached single leaves were collected for model development and testing. First, image processing-based area estimation was tested on manually segmented leaves. Then a Mask R-CNN-based model was investigated, and modified to accept RGBD images and to estimate the leaf area. The detached-leaf data set was then mixed with the attached-leaf plant data set to estimate the single leaf area for plant images, and another network design with two backbones was proposed: one for segmentation and the other for area estimation. Instead of trying all possibilities or random values, an agile approach was used in hyperparameter tuning. The final model was cross-validated with 5-folds and tested with two unseen datasets: detached and attached leaves. The F1 score with 90% IoA for segmentation result on unseen detached-leaf data was 1.0, while R-squared of area estimation was 0.81. For unseen plant data segmentation, the F1 score with 90% IoA was 0.59, while the R-squared score was 0.57. The research suggests using attached leaves with ground truth area to improve the results.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the algorithmic backbone of neural networks is brittle to imperceptible perturbations in the system inputs, which were generally known as misclassifying attacks. By targeting the real-time processing capability, a new class of latency attacks are reported recently. They exploit new attack surfaces in object detectors by creating a computational bottleneck in the post-processing module, that leads to cascading failure and puts the real-time downstream tasks at risks. In this work, we take an initial attempt to defend against this attack via background-attentive adversarial training that is also cognizant of the underlying hardware capabilities. We first draw system-level connections between latency attack and hardware capacity across heterogeneous GPU devices. Based on the particular adversarial behaviors, we utilize objectness loss as a proxy and build background attention into the adversarial training pipeline, and achieve a reasonable balance between clean and robust accuracy. The extensive experiments demonstrate the defense effectiveness of restoring real-time processing capability from $13$ FPS to $43$ FPS on Jetson Orin NX, with a better trade-off between the clean and robust accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods are susceptible to the inaccurate calibration relationship between LiDAR and the camera sensor. Such inaccuracies result in errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, ultimately causing misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a robust fusion framework called Graph BEV. Addressing errors caused by inaccurate point cloud projection, we introduce a Local Align module that employs neighbor-aware depth features via Graph matching. Additionally, we propose a Global Align module to rectify the misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. Our Graph BEV framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an mAP of 70.1\%, surpassing BEV Fusion by 1.6\% on the nuscenes validation set. Importantly, our Graph BEV outperforms BEV Fusion by 8.3\% under conditions with misalignment noise.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the unavailability of target-domain data, some methods leverage the multimodal capabilities of vision-language models, using textual prompts to estimate cross-domain information, enhancing the model's generalization capability. These methods typically use a single textual prompt, often referred to as the one-step prompt method. However, when dealing with complex styles such as the combination of rain and night, we observe that the performance of the one-step prompt method tends to be relatively weak. The reason may be that many scenes incorporate not just a single style but a combination of multiple styles. The one-step prompt method may not effectively synthesize combined information involving various styles. To address this limitation, we propose a new method, i.e., Style Evolving along Chain-of-Thought, which aims to progressively integrate and expand style information along the chain of thought, enabling the continual evolution of styles. Specifically, by progressively refining style descriptions and guiding the diverse evolution of styles, this approach enables more accurate simulation of various style characteristics and helps the model gradually learn and adapt to subtle differences between styles. Additionally, it exposes the model to a broader range of style features with different data distributions, thereby enhancing its generalization capability in unseen domains. The significant performance gains over five adverse-weather scenarios and the Real to Art benchmark demonstrate the superiorities of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the data sparsity and limited views, the clustering-based label fitting in unsupervised object detection often generates low-quality pseudo-labels. Multi-agent collaborative dataset, which involves the sharing of complementary observations among agents, holds the potential to break through this bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method that learns to Detect Objects from Multi-Agent LiDAR scans, termed DOtA, without using labels from external. DOtA first uses the internally shared ego-pose and ego-shape of collaborative agents to initialize the detector, leveraging the generalization performance of neural networks to infer preliminary labels. Subsequently,DOtA uses the complementary observations between agents to perform multi-scale encoding on preliminary labels, then decodes high-quality and low-quality labels. These labels are further used as prompts to guide a correct feature learning process, thereby enhancing the performance of the unsupervised object detection task. Extensive experiments on the V2V4Real and OPV2V datasets show that our DOtA outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised 3D object detection methods. Additionally, we also validate the effectiveness of the DOtA labels under various collaborative perception frameworks.The code is available at https://github.com/xmuqimingxia/DOtA.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/xmuqimingxia/DOtA) |

Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p></details> |  | None |

A variety of 2D and 3D MOD and MOT methods have been developed for monocular and stereo cameras. Road safety analysis can benefit from those advancements. As crashes are rare events, surrogate measures of safety (SMoS) have been developed for safety analyses. (Semi-)Automated safety analysis methods extract road user trajectories to compute safety indicators, for example, Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Post-encroachment Time (PET). Inspired by the success of deep learning in MOD and MOT, we investigate three MOT methods, including one based on a stereo-camera, using the annotated KITTI traffic video dataset. Two post-processing steps, IDsplit and SS, are developed to improve the tracking results and investigate the factors influencing the TTC. The experimental results show that, despite some advantages in terms of the numbers of interactions or similarity to the TTC distributions, all the tested methods systematically over-estimate the number of interactions and under-estimate the TTC: they report more interactions and more severe interactions, making the road user interactions appear less safe than they are. Further efforts will be directed towards testing more methods and more data, in particular from roadside sensors, to verify the results and improve the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by TRB Annual Meeting 2024</p></details> | None |

Generic VLM benchmarks are not designed to handle the complexities of geospatial data, an essential component for applications such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. Key challenges in the geospatial domain include temporal change detection, large-scale object counting, tiny object detection, and understanding relationships between entities in remote sensing imagery. To bridge this gap, we present GEOBench-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs on geospatial tasks, including scene understanding, object counting, localization, fine-grained categorization, segmentation, and temporal analysis. Our benchmark features over 10,000 manually verified instructions and spanning diverse visual conditions, object types, and scales. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs to assess performance on geospatial-specific challenges. The results indicate that although existing VLMs demonstrate potential, they face challenges when dealing with geospatial-specific tasks, highlighting the room for further improvements. Notably, the best-performing LLaVa-OneVision achieves only 41.7% accuracy on MCQs, slightly more than GPT-4o, which is approximately double the random guess performance.

Unfortunately, these models are not yet widely adopted in health monitoring due to exceptionally high requirements for model robustness and deployment in highly resource-constrained devices. In particular, the acquisition of biosignals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), is subject to large variations between training and deployment, necessitating domain generalization (DG) for robust classification quality across sensors and patients. The continuous monitoring of ECG also requires the execution of DNN models in convenient wearable devices, which is achieved by specialized ECG accelerators with small form factor and ultra-low power consumption. However, combining DG capabilities with ECG accelerators remains a challenge. This article provides a comprehensive overview of ECG accelerators and DG methods and discusses the implication of the combination of both domains, such that multi-domain ECG monitoring is enabled with emerging algorithm-hardware co-optimized systems. Within this context, an approach based on correction layers is proposed to deploy DG capabilities on the edge. Here, the DNN fine-tuning for unknown domains is limited to a single layer, while the remaining DNN model remains unmodified. Thus, computational complexity (CC) for DG is reduced with minimal memory overhead compared to conventional fine-tuning of the whole DNN model. The DNN model-dependent CC is reduced by more than 2.5x compared to DNN fine-tuning at an average increase of F1 score by more than 20% on the generalized target domain. In summary, this article provides a novel perspective on robust DNN classification on the edge for health monitoring applications.</p></details> |  | None |

It introduces geometric priors from 2D bounding boxes and 3D object dimensions to reduce the uncertainty of depth estimation. However, due to depth errors originating from the object's visual surface, the height of the bounding box often fails to represent the actual projected central height, which undermines the effectiveness of geometric depth. Direct prediction for the projected height unavoidably results in a loss of 2D priors, while multi-depth prediction with complex branches does not fully leverage geometric depth. This paper presents a Transformer-based monocular 3D object detection method called MonoDGP, which adopts perspective-invariant geometry errors to modify the projection formula. We also try to systematically discuss and explain the mechanisms and efficacy behind geometry errors, which serve as a simple but effective alternative to multi-depth prediction. Additionally, MonoDGP decouples the depth-guided decoder and constructs a 2D decoder only dependent on visual features, providing 2D priors and initializing object queries without the disturbance of 3D detection. To further optimize and fine-tune input tokens of the transformer decoder, we also introduce a Region Segment Head (RSH) that generates enhanced features and segment embeddings. Our monocular method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark without extra data.

However, these approaches predominantly depend on single-vehicle data collection for model training and optimization, resulting in significant challenges such as high data acquisition and annotation costs, the scarcity of critical driving scenarios, and fragmented datasets that impede model generalization. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce RS2V-L, a novel framework for reconstructing and synthesizing vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor observations. Specifically, our method transforms roadside LiDAR point clouds into the vehicle-mounted LiDAR coordinate system by leveraging the target vehicle's relative pose. Subsequently, high-fidelity vehicle-mounted LiDAR data is synthesized through virtual LiDAR modeling, point cloud classification, and resampling techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to reconstruct vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that incorporating the generated data into model training-complementing the KITTI dataset-enhances 3D object detection accuracy by over \text{30\%} while improving the efficiency of end-to-end autonomous driving data generation by more than an order of magnitude. These findings strongly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and underscore its potential in reducing dependence on costly vehicle-mounted data collection while improving the robustness of autonomous driving models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon self-examination, we have found that the data in the experimental section of our paper is uncertain.

Our approach integrates statistical analysis, image classification, object detection, and sentiment analysis to explore visual narratives in climate discourse. Additionally, we introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate interactive data exploration.

The introduction of Computer Vision (CV) has revolutionized visual quality inspection by improving the accuracy and efficiency of defect detection. However, traditional CV models heavily rely on extensive datasets for training, which can be costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. To overcome these challenges, synthetic images have emerged as a promising alternative. They offer a cost-effective solution with automatically generated labels. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for generating synthetic images using domain randomization.

However, improving their ability to detect rare classes or specialize in certain domains remains a challenge. While most recent methods rely on a single set of model weights for adaptation, we take a different approach by using modular deep learning. We introduce DitHub, a framework designed to create and manage a library of efficient adaptation modules. Inspired by Version Control Systems, DitHub organizes expert modules like branches that can be fetched and merged as needed. This modular approach enables a detailed study of how adaptation modules combine, making it the first method to explore this aspect in Object Detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ODinW-13 benchmark and ODinW-O, a newly introduced benchmark designed to evaluate how well models adapt when previously seen classes reappear.

Unlike previous geometric-primitive-based methods that rely on the detection of corners, our method focuses on edge detection as the primary mechanism for roof reconstruction, while utilizing geometric relationships to define corners and faces. We adapt the YOLOv8 OBB model, originally designed for rotated object detection, to extract roof edges effectively. Our method demonstrates robustness against noise and occlusion, leading to precise vectorized representations of building roofs. Experiments conducted on the SGA and Melville datasets highlight the method's effectiveness. At the raster level, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art foundation segmentation model (SAM), achieving a mIoU between 0.85 and 1 for most samples and an ovIoU close to 0.97. At the vector level, evaluation using the Hausdorff distance, PolyS metric, and our raster-vector-metric demonstrates significant improvements after polygonization, with a close approximation to the reference data. The method successfully handles diverse roof structures and refines edge gaps, even on complex roof structures of new, excluded from training datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of this approach to address challenges in automatic roof structure vectorization, supporting various applications such as urban terrain reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, conference paper (VISAPP 2025, part of the 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging, and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications)</p></details> | None |

However, the computational demands of these models, particularly with large image sizes and multiple transformer layers, pose significant challenges for efficient running on edge devices. Existing pruning and distillation methods either need retraining or are designed for ViT models, which are hard to migrate to 3D detectors. To address this issue, we propose a zero-shot runtime pruning method for transformer decoders in 3D object detection models. The method, termed tgGBC (trim keys gradually Guided By Classification scores), systematically trims keys in transformer modules based on their importance. We expand the classification score to multiply it with the attention map to get the importance score of each key and then prune certain keys after each transformer layer according to their importance scores. Our method achieves a 1.99x speedup in the transformer decoder of the latest ToC3D model, with only a minimal performance loss of less than 1%. Interestingly, for certain models, our method even enhances their performance. Moreover, we deploy 3D detectors with tgGBC on an edge device, further validating the effectiveness of our method.

While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for energy-efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here, we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates DWConvL-STMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GBlobs: Explicit Local Structure via Gaussian Blobs for Improved Cross-Domain LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08639v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D detectors need large datasets for training, yet they struggle to generalize to novel domains. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to mitigate this by training detectors that are invariant to such domain shifts. Current DG approaches exclusively rely on global geometric features (point cloud Cartesian coordinates) as input features. Over-reliance on these global geometric features can, however, cause 3D detectors to prioritize object location and absolute position, resulting in poor cross-domain performance. To mitigate this, we propose to exploit explicit local point cloud structure for DG, in particular by encoding point cloud neighborhoods with Gaussian blobs, GBlobs. Our proposed formulation is highly efficient and requires no additional parameters. Without any bells and whistles, simply by integrating GBlobs in existing detectors, we beat the current state-of-the-art in challenging single-source DG benchmarks by over 21 mAP (Waymo->KITTI), 13 mAP (KITTI->Waymo), and 12 mAP (nuScenes->KITTI), without sacrificing in-domain performance. Additionally, GBlobs demonstrate exceptional performance in multi-source DG, surpassing the current state-of-the-art by 17, 12, and 5 mAP on Waymo, KITTI, and ONCE, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, despite the strong performance of PETR-based methods in 3D perception benchmarks, their direct INT8 quantization for onboard deployment leads to drastic accuracy drops-up to 58.2% in mAP and 36.9% in NDS on the NuScenes dataset. In this work, we propose Q-PETR, a quantization-aware position embedding transformation that re-engineers key components of the PETR framework to reconcile the discrepancy between the dynamic ranges of positional encodings and image features, and to adapt the cross-attention mechanism for low-bit inference. By redesigning the positional encoding module and introducing an adaptive quantization strategy, Q-PETR maintains floating-point performance with a performance degradation of less than 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor post-training quantization. Moreover, compared to its FP32 counterpart, Q-PETR achieves a two-fold speedup and reduces memory usage by three times, thereby offering a deployment-friendly solution for resource-constrained onboard devices. Extensive experiments across various PETR-series models validate the strong generalization and practical benefits of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

However, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world usability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one referring, that hinder progress in this area. In this work, we revisit this task from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and model architecture. We first identify five aspects of referable entities and three distinctive characteristics of this task. Next, we introduce HumanRef, a novel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world applications. From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large language model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust referring model named RexSeek. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple individuals. In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also generalizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly applicable across various perception tasks.

We investigate using superpixels coupled with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between detector-based captioning architectures and those that solely pretrain on large datasets.

Conventional methods are difficult to meet the requirements of real-time inference due to the two-stage or point-based architecture. Inspired by the success of multi-level fully sparse convolutional architecture in 3D object detection, we aim to build a new 3D visual grounding framework following this technical route. However, as in 3D visual grounding task the 3D scene representation should be deeply interacted with text features, sparse convolution-based architecture is inefficient for this interaction due to the large amount of voxel features. To this end, we propose text-guided pruning (TGP) and completion-based addition (CBA) to deeply fuse 3D scene representation and text features in an efficient way by gradual region pruning and target completion. Specifically, TGP iteratively sparsifies the 3D scene representation and thus efficiently interacts the voxel features with text features by cross-attention. To mitigate the affect of pruning on delicate geometric information, CBA adaptively fixes the over-pruned region by voxel completion with negligible computational overhead. Compared with previous single-stage methods, our method achieves top inference speed and surpasses previous fastest method by 100\% FPS. Our method also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy even compared with two-stage methods, with $+1.13$ lead of Acc@0.5 on ScanRefer, and $+2.6$ and $+3.2$ leads on NR3D and SR3D respectively.

In the community, various data-driven approaches have been developed to address this issue, yet their effectiveness is limited. This is mainly because most existing crowd counting datasets on which the methods are trained are based on passive cameras, restricting their ability to fully sense the environment. Recently, embodied navigation methods have shown significant potential in precise object detection in interactive scenes. These methods incorporate active camera settings, holding promise in addressing the fundamental issues in crowd counting. However, most existing methods are designed for indoor navigation, showing unknown performance in analyzing complex object distribution in large scale scenes, such as crowds. Besides, most existing embodied navigation datasets are indoor scenes with limited scale and object quantity, preventing them from being introduced into dense crowd analysis. Based on this, a novel task, Embodied Crowd Counting (ECC), is proposed. We first build up an interactive simulator, Embodied Crowd Counting Dataset (ECCD), which enables large scale scenes and large object quantity. A prior probability distribution that approximates realistic crowd distribution is introduced to generate crowds. Then, a zero-shot navigation method (ZECC) is proposed. This method contains a MLLM driven coarse-to-fine navigation mechanism, enabling active Z-axis exploration, and a normal-line-based crowd distribution analysis method for fine counting. Experimental results against baselines show that the proposed method achieves the best trade-off between counting accuracy and navigation cost.</p></details> |  | None |

However, standard supervised learning often leads to unintended over-reliance on the BG, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. The problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG, sacrificing context information for improved generalization. We propose "Localize to Recognize Robustly" (L2R2), a novel recognition approach which exploits the benefits of context-aware classification while maintaining robustness to distribution shifts. L2R2 leverages advances in zero-shot detection to localize the FG before recognition. It improves the performance of both standard recognition with supervised training, as well as multimodal zero-shot recognition with VLMs, while being robust to long-tail BGs and distribution shifts. The results confirm localization before recognition is possible for a wide range of datasets and they highlight the limits of object detection on others</p></details> |  | None |

However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world environments and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality. Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch generation problem. Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments. The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate deployment within the scene. We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges. MAGIC automatically understands scene context and generates adversarial patch through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities. In particular, MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal deployment strategies based on scene understanding. The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes. We validate our method on both digital and physical levels, i.e., nuImage and manually captured real-world scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effective for attacking widely applied object detection systems, i.e., YOLO and DETR series.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SparseVoxFormer: Sparse Voxel-based Transformer for Multi-modal 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08092v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most previous 3D object detection methods that leverage the multi-modality of LiDAR and cameras utilize the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space for intermediate feature representation. However, this space uses a low x, y-resolution and sacrifices z-axis information to reduce the overall feature resolution, which may result in declined accuracy. To tackle the problem of using low-resolution features, this paper focuses on the sparse nature of LiDAR point cloud data. From our observation, the number of occupied cells in the 3D voxels constructed from a LiDAR data can be even fewer than the number of total cells in the BEV map, despite the voxels' significantly higher resolution. Based on this, we introduce a novel sparse voxel-based transformer network for 3D object detection, dubbed as SparseVoxFormer. Instead of performing BEV feature extraction, we directly leverage sparse voxel features as the input for a transformer-based detector. Moreover, with regard to the camera modality, we introduce an explicit modality fusion approach that involves projecting 3D voxel coordinates onto 2D images and collecting the corresponding image features. Thanks to these components, our approach can leverage geometrically richer multi-modal features while even reducing the computational cost. Beyond the proof-of-concept level, we further focus on facilitating better multi-modal fusion and flexible control over the number of sparse features. Finally, thorough experimental results demonstrate that utilizing a significantly smaller number of sparse features drastically reduces computational costs in a 3D object detector while enhancing both overall and long-range performance.</p></details> |  | None |

The experimental results show that our method can successfully generate high-fidelity radar signals. Moreover, we have trained a popular object detection neural network with data augmented by our synthesized radar.

For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.</p></details> |  | None |

The recent success of vision-language models (VLMs) has demonstrated their remarkable capabilities to understand open vocabularies. Existing works that leverage VLMs for 3D object detection (3DOD) generally resort to representations that lose the rich scene context required for 3D perception. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a hierarchical framework, named HCMA, to simultaneously learn local object and global scene information for OV-3DOD. Specifically, we first design a Hierarchical Data Integration (HDI) approach to obtain coarse-to-fine 3D-image-text data, which is fed into a VLM to extract object-centric knowledge. To facilitate the association of feature hierarchies, we then propose an Interactive Cross-Modal Alignment (ICMA) strategy to establish effective intra-level and inter-level feature connections. To better align features across different levels, we further propose an Object-Focusing Context Adjustment (OFCA) module to refine multi-level features by emphasizing object-related features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms SOTA methods on the existing OV-3DOD benchmarks. It also achieves promising OV-3DOD results even without any 3D annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 (Extented Version).

In this work, we exploit an overlooked property of adversarial perturbations--their dependence on image transforms--and introduce transform-dependent adversarial attacks. Unlike traditional attacks, our perturbations exhibit metamorphic properties, enabling diverse adversarial effects as a function of transformation parameters. We demonstrate that this transform-dependent vulnerability exists across different architectures (e.g., CNN and transformer), vision tasks (e.g., image classification and object detection), and a wide range of image transforms. Additionally, we show that transform-dependent perturbations can serve as a defense mechanism, preventing sensitive information disclosure when image enhancement transforms pose a risk of revealing private content. Through analysis in blackbox and defended model settings, we show that transform-dependent perturbations achieve high targeted attack success rates, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer attacks by 17-31% in blackbox scenarios. Our work introduces novel, controllable paradigm for adversarial attack deployment, revealing a previously overlooked vulnerability in deep networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, we propose Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, we present Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency. Extensive experiments show YOLOE's exceptional zero-shot performance and transferability with high inference efficiency and low training cost. Notably, on LVIS, with 3$\times$ less training cost and 1.4$\times$ inference speedup, YOLOE-v8-S surpasses YOLO-Worldv2-S by 3.5 AP. When transferring to COCO, YOLOE-v8-L achieves 0.6 AP$^b$ and 0.4 AP$^m$ gains over closed-set YOLOv8-L with nearly 4$\times$ less training time.

This study proposes a model called HGO-YOLO, which integrates the HGNetv2 architecture into YOLOv8. This combination expands the receptive field and captures a wider range of features while simplifying model complexity through GhostConv. We introduced a lightweight detection head, OptiConvDetect, which utilizes parameter sharing to construct the detection head effectively. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a mAP@0.5 of 87.4% and a recall rate of 81.1%, with a model size of only 4.6 MB and a frame rate of 56 FPS on the CPU. HGO-YOLO not only improves accuracy by 3.0% but also reduces computational load by 51.69% (from 8.9 GFLOPs to 4.3 GFLOPs), while increasing the frame rate by a factor of 1.7. Additionally, real-time tests were conducted on Raspberry Pi4 and NVIDIA platforms. These results indicate that the HGO-YOLO model demonstrates superior performance in anomaly behavior detection.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in YOLO-based Object Detection Models: A Revisit to Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07330v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection systems must reliably perceive objects of interest without being overly confident to ensure safe decision-making in dynamic environments. Filtering techniques based on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection are commonly added as an extra safeguard to filter hallucinations caused by overconfidence in novel objects. Nevertheless, evaluating YOLO-family detectors and their filters under existing OoD benchmarks often leads to unsatisfactory performance. This paper studies the underlying reasons for performance bottlenecks and proposes a methodology to improve performance fundamentally. Our first contribution is a calibration of all existing evaluation results: Although images in existing OoD benchmark datasets are claimed not to have objects within in-distribution (ID) classes (i.e., categories defined in the training dataset), around 13% of objects detected by the object detector are actually ID objects. Dually, the ID dataset containing OoD objects can also negatively impact the decision boundary of filters. These ultimately lead to a significantly imprecise performance estimation. Our second contribution is to consider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors and filters. By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset that semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted OoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness score, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a combined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving benchmark BDD-100K.

| **[Semantic Communications with Computer Vision Sensing for Edge Video Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07252v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of vision sensors in edge applications, such as surveillance, the transmission of video data consumes substantial spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SC) offers a solution by extracting and compressing information at the semantic level, preserving the accuracy and relevance of transmitted data while significantly reducing the volume of transmitted information. However, traditional SC methods face inefficiencies due to the repeated transmission of static frames in edge videos, exacerbated by the absence of sensing capabilities, which results in spectrum inefficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a SC with computer vision sensing (SCCVS) framework for edge video transmission. The framework first introduces a compression ratio (CR) adaptive SC (CRSC) model, capable of adjusting CR based on whether the frames are static or dynamic, effectively conserving spectrum resources. Additionally, we implement an object detection and semantic segmentation models-enabled sensing (OSMS) scheme, which intelligently senses the changes in the scene and assesses the significance of each frame through in-context analysis. Hence, The OSMS scheme provides CR prompts to the CRSC model based on real-time sensing results. Moreover, both CRSC and OSMS are designed as lightweight models, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained sensors commonly used in practical edge applications. Experimental simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCCVS framework, demonstrating its ability to enhance transmission efficiency without sacrificing critical semantic information.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditionally, 3D object detection methods are trained in a fully-supervised setup, requiring LiDAR and vast amounts of human annotations, which are laborious, costly, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing amounts of data being captured. We present a novel method to train a 3D object detector from a single RGB camera without domain-specific human annotations, making orders of magnitude more data available for training. The method uses newly proposed Local Object Motion Model to disentangle object movement source between subsequent frames, is approximately 700 times faster than previous work and compensates camera focal length differences to aggregate multiple datasets. The method is evaluated on three public datasets, where despite using no human labels, it outperforms prior work by a significant margin. It also shows its versatility as a pre-training tool for fully-supervised training and shows that combining pseudo-labels from multiple datasets can achieve comparable accuracy to using human labels from a single dataset.

Two prominent approaches in SSL include contrastive-based learning and self-distillation utilizing cropping augmentation. Lately, masked image modeling (MIM) has emerged as a more potent SSL technique, employing image inpainting as a pretext task. MIM creates a strong inductive bias toward meaningful spatial and semantic understanding. This has opened up new opportunities for SSL to contribute not only to classification tasks but also to more complex applications like object detection and image segmentation. Building upon this progress, our research paper introduces a scalable and practical SSL approach centered around more challenging pretext tasks that facilitate the acquisition of robust features. Specifically, we leverage multi-scale image reconstruction from randomly masked input images as the foundation for feature learning. Our hypothesis posits that reconstructing high-resolution images enables the model to attend to finer spatial details, particularly beneficial for discerning subtle intricacies within medical images. The proposed SSL features help improve classification performance on the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) dataset. In pathology classification, our method demonstrates a 3\% increase in average precision (AP) and a 1\% increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Moreover, in mass margins classification, our approach achieves a 4\% increase in AP and a 2\% increase in AUC.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose SimROD, a lightweight and effective approach for RAW object detection. We introduce a Global Gamma Enhancement (GGE) module, which applies a learnable global gamma transformation with only four parameters, improving feature representation while keeping the model efficient. Additionally, we leverage the green channel's richer signal to enhance local details, aligning with the human eye's sensitivity and Bayer filter design.

However, there still exist fundamental challenges: deeply coupled fusion methods assume continuous sensor availability, making them vulnerable to sensor degradation and failure, whereas sensor-wise cross-attention fusion methods struggle with computational cost and unified feature representation. This paper presents availability-aware sensor fusion (ASF), a novel method that employs unified canonical projection (UCP) to enable consistency in all sensor features for fusion and cross-attention across sensors along patches (CASAP) to enhance robustness of sensor fusion against sensor degradation and failure. As a result, the proposed ASF shows a superior object detection performance to the existing state-of-the-art fusion methods under various weather and sensor degradation (or failure) conditions; Extensive experiments on the K-Radar dataset demonstrate that ASF achieves improvements of 9.7% in AP BEV (87.2%) and 20.1% in AP 3D (73.6%) in object detection at IoU=0.5, while requiring a low computational cost.

Self-distillation recently is emerging as a promising approach for fine-tuning VLMs to better adapt to local regions without requiring extensive annotations. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from significant `foreground bias', where models tend to wrongly identify background regions as foreground objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. DenseVLM leverages the pre-trained VLM to retrieve categories for unlabeled regions and then decouples the interference between foreground and background features. We show that DenseVLM can directly replace the original VLM in open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation methods, leading to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, it exhibits promising zero-shot scalability when training on more extensive and diverse datasets.

However, most existing methods focus on detecting predefined object categories, limiting their applicability in real-world open scenarios. In this paper, we extend aerial object detection to open scenarios through image-text collaboration and propose OVA-Det, a highly efficient open-vocabulary detector for aerial scenes. Specifically, we first introduce an image-to-text alignment loss to replace the conventional category regression loss, thereby eliminating category limitations. Next, we propose a lightweight text-guided strategy that enhances the feature extraction process in the encoder and enables queries to focus on class-relevant image features within the decoder, further improving detection accuracy without introducing significant additional costs. Extensive comparison experiments demonstrate that the proposed OVA-Det outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all three widely used benchmark datasets by a large margin. For instance, for zero-shot detection on DIOR, OVA-Det achieves 37.2 mAP and 79.8 Recall, 12.4 and 42.0 higher than that of YOLO-World.

To address this problem, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) guided Progressive feature Alignment Network called LPANet, which leverages the semantic features extracted from a large language model to guide the progressive semantic and spatial alignment between modalities for multimodal UAV object detection. To employ the powerful semantic representation of LLM, we generate the fine-grained text descriptions of each object category by ChatGPT and then extract the semantic features using the large language model MPNet. Based on the semantic features, we guide the semantic and spatial alignments in a progressive manner as follows. First, we design the Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to pull the semantic features and multimodal visual features of each object closer, alleviating the semantic differences of objects between modalities. Second, we design the Explicit Spatial alignment Module (ESM) by integrating the semantic relations into the estimation of feature-level offsets, alleviating the coarse spatial misalignment between modalities. Finally, we design the Implicit Spatial alignment Module (ISM), which leverages the cross-modal correlations to aggregate key features from neighboring regions to achieve implicit spatial alignment.

These issues hinder the performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous driving.Traditional enhancement techniques, such as multi-scale fusion and histogram equalization, fail to preserve fine details and often struggle with maintaining the natural appearance of enhanced images under complex lighting conditions. Although the Retinex theory provides a foundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to suboptimal image quality.

Traditional optical flow estimation methods rely on restrictive assumptions like brightness constancy and slow motion constraints. Recent deep learning-based flow estimations require extensive training on large domain-specific datasets, making them computationally demanding. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) advances have enabled deep learning models to take advantage of optical flow as an important feature for object tracking and motion analysis. Since optical flow is commonly encoded in HSV for visualization, its conversion to RGB for neural network processing is nonlinear and may introduce perceptual distortions. These transformations amplify the sensitivity to estimation errors, potentially affecting the predictive accuracy of the networks. To address these challenges that are influential to the performance of downstream network models, we propose Reynolds flow, a novel training-free flow estimation inspired by the Reynolds transport theorem, offering a principled approach to modeling complex motion dynamics. In addition to conventional HSV-based visualization of Reynolds flow, we also introduce an RGB-encoded representation of Reynolds flow designed to improve flow visualization and feature enhancement for neural networks. We evaluated the effectiveness of Reynolds flow in video-based tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks, tiny object detection on UAVDB, infrared object detection on Anti-UAV, and pose estimation on GolfDB, demonstrate that networks trained with RGB-encoded Reynolds flow achieve SOTA performance, exhibiting improved robustness and efficiency across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, these methods suffer challenges when accurate labels are extremely absent. In this paper, we propose a boosting strategy, termed SP3D, explicitly utilizing the cross-modal semantic prompts generated from Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to boost the 3D detector with robust feature discrimination capability under sparse annotation settings. Specifically, we first develop a Confident Points Semantic Transfer (CPST) module that generates accurate cross-modal semantic prompts through boundary-constrained center cluster selection. Based on these accurate semantic prompts, which we treat as seed points, we introduce a Dynamic Cluster Pseudo-label Generation (DCPG) module to yield pseudo-supervision signals from the geometry shape of multi-scale neighbor points. Additionally, we design a Distribution Shape score (DS score) that chooses high-quality supervision signals for the initial training of the 3D detector. Experiments on the KITTI dataset and Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) have validated that SP3D can enhance the performance of sparsely supervised detectors by a large margin under meager labeling conditions. Moreover, we verified SP3D in the zero-shot setting, where its performance exceeded that of the state-of-the-art methods.

Existing approaches achieve this by connecting traditional 3D object detectors with vision-language models (VLMs) to regress 3D bounding boxes for novel objects and perform open-vocabulary classification through cross-modal alignment between 3D and 2D features. However, achieving robust cross-modal alignment remains a challenge due to semantic inconsistencies when generating corresponding 3D and 2D feature pairs. To overcome this challenge, we present OV-SCAN, an Open-Vocabulary 3D framework that enforces Semantically Consistent Alignment for Novel object discovery. OV-SCAN employs two core strategies: discovering precise 3D annotations and filtering out low-quality or corrupted alignment pairs (arising from 3D annotation, occlusion-induced, or resolution-induced noise).

Existing methods have explored different techniques, including CNN, deep learning, and Transformers, for object detection and video classification. However, detecting tiny objects, e.g., guns, in videos remains challenging due to their small scale and varying appearances in complex scenes. Moreover, existing video analysis models for classification or detection often perform poorly in real-world gun detection scenarios due to limited labeled video datasets for training. Thus, developing efficient methods for effectively capturing tiny object features and designing models capable of accurate gun detection in real-world videos is imperative. To address these challenges, we make three original contributions in this paper. First, we conduct an empirical study of several existing video classification and object detection methods to identify guns in videos. Our extensive analysis shows that these methods may not accurately detect guns in videos. Second, we propose a novel two-stage gun detection method. In stage 1, we train an image-augmented model to effectively classify ``Gun'' videos. To make the detection more precise and efficient, stage 2 employs an object detection model to locate the exact region of the gun within video frames for videos classified as ``Gun'' by stage 1. Third, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed domain-specific method achieves significant performance improvements and enhances efficiency compared with existing techniques.

While deep models achieve strong performance, their efficiency remains a challenge. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique, but existing feature-based KD methods rely on static, teacher-driven feature selection, failing to adapt to the student's evolving learning state or leverage dynamic student-teacher interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive student-teacher Cooperative Attention Masking for Knowledge Distillation (ACAM-KD), which introduces two key components: (1) Student-Teacher Cross-Attention Feature Fusion (STCA-FF), which adaptively integrates features from both models for a more interactive distillation process, and (2) Adaptive Spatial-Channel Masking (ASCM), which dynamically generates importance masks to enhance both spatial and channel-wise feature selection. Unlike conventional KD methods, ACAM-KD adapts to the student's evolving needs throughout the entire distillation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. For instance, on COCO2017, ACAM-KD improves object detection performance by up to 1.4 mAP over the state-of-the-art when distilling a ResNet-50 student from a ResNet-101 teacher. For semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, it boosts mIoU by 3.09 over the baseline with DeepLabV3-MobileNetV2 as the student model.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 tables, 3 figures</p></details> | None |

To address this, we introduce the first generalized cross-domain few-shot (GCFS) task in 3D object detection, which focuses on adapting a source-pretrained model for high performance on both common and novel classes in a target domain with few-shot samples. Our solution integrates multi-modal fusion and contrastive-enhanced prototype learning within one framework, holistically overcoming challenges related to data scarcity and domain adaptation in the GCFS setting. The multi-modal fusion module utilizes 2D vision-language models to extract rich, open-set semantic knowledge. To address biases in point distributions across varying structural complexities, we particularly introduce a physically-aware box searching strategy that leverages laser imaging principles to generate high-quality 3D box proposals from 2D insights, enhancing object recall. To effectively capture domain-specific representations for each class from limited target data, we further propose a contrastive-enhanced prototype learning, which strengthens the model's adaptability. We evaluate our approach with three GCFS benchmark settings, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for GCFS tasks. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

We formalize this overlooked yet critical editing paradigm as "Get-In-Video Editing", where users provide reference images to precisely specify visual elements they wish to incorporate into videos. Addressing this task's dual challenges, severe training data scarcity and technical challenges in maintaining spatiotemporal coherence, we introduce three key contributions. First, we develop GetIn-1M dataset created through our automated Recognize-Track-Erase pipeline, which sequentially performs video captioning, salient instance identification, object detection, temporal tracking, and instance removal to generate high-quality video editing pairs with comprehensive annotations (reference image, tracking mask, instance prompt). Second, we present GetInVideo, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages a diffusion transformer architecture with 3D full attention to process reference images, condition videos, and masks simultaneously, maintaining temporal coherence, preserving visual identity, and ensuring natural scene interactions when integrating reference objects into videos. Finally, we establish GetInBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for Get-In-Video Editing scenario, demonstrating our approach's superior performance through extensive evaluations. Our work enables accessible, high-quality incorporation of specific real-world subjects into videos, significantly advancing personalized video editing capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page:https://zhuangshaobin.github.io/GetInVideo-project/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zhuangshaobin.github.io/GetInVideo-project) |

Detecting their positions and orientations in X-ray fluoroscopic images is important for many clinical applications. Method: In this paper, a novel attention mechanism was designed to guide a convolution neural network (CNN) model to the areas of wires in X-ray images, as nearly all interventional devices and catheters used in cardiovascular procedures contain wires. The attention mechanism includes multi-scale Gaussian derivative filters and a dot-product-based attention layer. By utilizing the proposed attention mechanism, a lightweight foundation model can be created to detect multiple objects simultaneously with higher precision and real-time speed. Results: The proposed model was trained and tested on a total of 12,438 X-ray images. An accuracy of 0.88 was achieved for detecting an echo probe and 0.87 for detecting an artificial valve at 58 FPS. The accuracy was measured by intersection-over-union (IoU). We also achieved a 99.8% success rate in detecting a 10-electrode catheter and a 97.8% success rate in detecting an ablation catheter. Conclusion: Our detection foundation model can simultaneously detect and identify both interventional devices and flexible catheters in real-time X-ray fluoroscopic images. Significance: The proposed model employs a novel attention mechanism to achieve high-performance object detection, making it suitable for various clinical applications and robotic-assisted surgeries.

Nonetheless, MIS inherently relies on indirect visualization and precise instrument control, posing unique challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled real-time surgical scene understanding through techniques such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, with scene reconstruction emerging as a key element for enhanced intraoperative guidance. Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have been explored for this purpose, their substantial data requirements and slow rendering inhibit real-time performance. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a more efficient alternative, achieving state-of-the-art performance in dynamic surgical scene reconstruction. In this work, we introduce Feature-EndoGaussian (FEG), an extension of 3DGS that integrates 2D segmentation cues into 3D rendering to enable real-time semantic and scene reconstruction. By leveraging pretrained segmentation foundation models, FEG incorporates semantic feature distillation within the Gaussian deformation framework, thereby enhancing both reconstruction fidelity and segmentation accuracy. On the EndoNeRF dataset, FEG achieves superior performance (SSIM of 0.97, PSNR of 39.08, and LPIPS of 0.03) compared to leading methods. Additionally, on the EndoVis18 dataset, FEG demonstrates competitive class-wise segmentation metrics while balancing model size and real-time performance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures | None |

Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) provides a solution by leveraging multimodal associations between text prompts and visual features. However, existing OVD methods for remote sensing (RS) images are constrained by small-scale datasets and fail to address the unique challenges of remote sensing interpretation, include oriented object detection and the need for both high precision and real-time performance in diverse scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose OpenRSD, a universal open-prompt RS object detection framework. OpenRSD supports multimodal prompts and integrates multi-task detection heads to balance accuracy and real-time requirements. Additionally, we design a multi-stage training pipeline to enhance the generalization of model. Evaluated on seven public datasets, OpenRSD demonstrates superior performance in oriented and horizontal bounding box detection, with real-time inference capabilities suitable for large-scale RS image analysis. Compared to YOLO-World, OpenRSD exhibits an 8.7\% higher average precision and achieves an inference speed of 20.8 FPS. Codes and models will be released.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |

Existing domain adaptation methods usually require retraining the model for new domains, which is impractical for agricultural applications due to constantly changing environments. In this paper, we propose DODA ($D$iffusion for $O$bject-detection $D$omain Adaptation in $A$griculture), a diffusion-based framework that can adapt the detector to a new domain in just 2 minutes. DODA incorporates external domain embeddings and an improved layout-to-image approach, allowing it to generate high-quality detection data for new domains without additional training. We demonstrate DODA's effectiveness on the Global Wheat Head Detection dataset, where fine-tuning detectors on DODA-generated data yields significant improvements across multiple domains. DODA provides a simple yet powerful solution for agricultural domain adaptation, reducing the barriers for growers to use detection in personalised environments.

In this paper, we propose SAM-COD that performs camouflaged object detection for RGB-D inputs. While keeping the SAM architecture intact, dual stream adapters are expanded on the image encoder to learn potential complementary information from RGB images and depth images, and fine-tune the mask decoder and its depth replica to perform dual-stream mask prediction. In practice, the dual stream adapters are embedded into the attention block of the image encoder in a parallel manner to facilitate the refinement and correction of the two types of image embeddings. To mitigate channel discrepancies arising from dual stream embeddings that do not directly interact with each other, we augment the association of dual stream embeddings using bidirectional knowledge distillation including a model distiller and a modal distiller. In addition, to predict the masks for RGB and depth attention maps, we hybridize the two types of image embeddings which are jointly learned with the prompt embeddings to update the initial prompt, and then feed them into the mask decoders to synchronize the consistency of image embeddings and prompt embeddings. Experimental results on four COD benchmarks show that our SAM-COD achieves excellent detection performance gains over SAM and achieves state-of-the-art results with a given fine-tuning paradigm.</p></details> |  | None |

Enhancing the performance of these models such as the transformer based Florence 2 on specialized tasks like object detection in complex and unstructured environments requires fine-tuning. The goal of this paper is to improve the efficiency of the Florence 2 model in challenging environments by finetuning it. We accomplished this by experimenting with different configurations, using various GPU types (T4, L4, A100) and optimizers such as AdamW and SGD. We also employed a range of learning rates and LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation) settings. Analyzing the performance metrics, such as Mean Average Precision (mAP) scores,reveals that the finetuned Florence 2 models performed comparably to YOLO models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. This demonstrates how transformer based VLMs can be adapted for detailed object detection tasks. The paper emphasizes the capability of optimized transformer based VLMs to address specific challenges in object detection within unstructured environments, opening up promising avenues for practical applications in demanding and complex settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> | None |

Two types of approaches to the problem have evolved: 1) Supervised and 2) optimization-based methods. Supervised methods are fast during inference and achieve high-quality results, however, they are limited by the need for large amounts of labeled training data and are susceptible to domain gaps. In contrast, unsupervised test-time optimization methods do not face the problem of domain gaps but usually suffer from substantial runtime, exhibit artifacts, or fail to converge to the right solution. In this work, we mitigate several limitations of existing optimization-based methods. To this end, we 1) introduce a simple voxel grid-based model that improves over the standard MLP-based formulation in multiple dimensions and 2) introduce a new multiframe loss formulation. 3) We combine both contributions in our new method, termed Floxels. On the Argoverse 2 benchmark, Floxels is surpassed only by EulerFlow among unsupervised methods while achieving comparable performance at a fraction of the computational cost. Floxels achieves a massive speedup of more than ~60 - 140x over EulerFlow, reducing the runtime from a day to 10 minutes per sequence. Over the faster but low-quality baseline, NSFP, Floxels achieves a speedup of ~14x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

This work introduces DEAL-YOLO, a novel approach that improves small object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images by using multi-objective loss functions like Wise IoU (WIoU) and Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD), which prioritize pixels near the centre of the bounding box, ensuring smoother localization and reducing abrupt deviations. Additionally, the model is optimized through efficient feature extraction with Linear Deformable (LD) convolutions, enhancing accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The Scaled Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) module enhances object detection by effectively capturing inter-scale relationships, improving feature representation, and boosting metrics through optimized multiscale fusion. Comparison with baseline models reveals high efficacy with up to 69.5\% fewer parameters compared to vanilla Yolov8-N, highlighting the robustness of the proposed modifications. Through this approach, our paper aims to facilitate the detection of endangered species, animal population analysis, habitat monitoring, biodiversity research, and various other applications that enrich wildlife conservation efforts. DEAL-YOLO employs a two-stage inference paradigm for object detection, refining selected regions to improve localization and confidence.

However, in real-world scenarios where data arrives incrementally, neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to a loss of previously learned knowledge. To address this, prior research has explored strategies for Class Incremental Learning (CIL) in Continual Learning for Object Detection (CLOD), with most approaches focusing on two-stage object detectors. However, existing work suggests that Learning without Forgetting (LwF) may be ineffective for one-stage anchor-free detectors like YOLO due to noisy regression outputs, which risk transferring corrupted knowledge. In this work, we introduce YOLO LwF, a self-distillation approach tailored for YOLO-based continual object detection. We demonstrate that when coupled with a replay memory, YOLO LwF significantly mitigates forgetting. Compared to previous approaches, it achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP by +2.1% and +2.9% on the VOC and COCO benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

While some large-scale models offer high accuracy, their long inference times make them unsuitable for real-time deployment on edge devices. On the other hand, models designed for low computational power often suffer from poor detection accuracy. This paper focuses on small target detection and explores methods for object detection under low computational constraints. Building on the YOLOv8 model, we propose a new network architecture called FDM-YOLO. Our research includes the following key contributions: We introduce FDM-YOLO by analyzing the output of the YOLOv8 detection head. We add a highresolution layer and remove the large target detection layer to better handle small targets. Based on PConv, we propose a lightweight network structure called Fast-C2f, which is integrated into the PAN module of the model. To mitigate the accuracy loss caused by model lightweighting, we employ dynamic upsampling (Dysample) and a lightweight EMA attention mechanism.The FDM-YOLO model was validated on the Visdrone dataset, achieving a 38% reduction in parameter count and improving the Map0.5 score from 38.4% to 42.5%, all while maintaining nearly the same inference speed. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in balancing accuracy and efficiency for edge device deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing open-vocabulary object detectors attempt to utilize the pre-trained VLMs to attain generalized representation. F-ViT uses the pre-trained visual encoder as the backbone network and freezes it during training. However, its frozen backbone doesn't benefit from the labeled data to strengthen the representation for detection. Therefore, we propose a novel two-branch backbone network, named as \textbf{V}iT-Feature-\textbf{M}odulated Multi-Scale \textbf{C}onvolutional Network (VMCNet), which consists of a trainable convolutional branch, a frozen pre-trained ViT branch and a VMC module. The trainable CNN branch could be optimized with labeled data while the frozen pre-trained ViT branch could keep the representation ability derived from large-scale pre-training. Then, the proposed VMC module could modulate the multi-scale CNN features with the representations from ViT branch. With this proposed mixed structure, the detector is more likely to discover objects of novel categories. Evaluated on two popular benchmarks, our method boosts the detection performance on novel category and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On OV-COCO, the proposed method achieves 44.3 AP$_{50}^{\mathrm{novel}}$ with ViT-B/16 and 48.5 AP$_{50}^{\mathrm{novel}}$ with ViT-L/14.

However, collecting a large dataset, even if unlabeled, is a challenging and expensive endeavor, especially in medical imaging. In addition, constraints such as privacy issues can result in cases where source data is unavailable. Taking in consideration these challenges, we propose MIAdapt, an adaptive approach for Microscopic Imagery Adaptation as a solution for Source-free Few-shot Domain Adaptive Object detection (SF-FSDA). We also define two competitive baselines (1) Faster-FreeShot and (2) MT-FreeShot. Extensive experiments on the challenging M5-Malaria and Raabin-WBC datasets validate the effectiveness of MIAdapt. Without using any image from the source domain MIAdapt surpasses state-of-the-art source-free UDA (SF-UDA) methods by +21.3% mAP and few-shot domain adaptation (FSDA) approaches by +4.7% mAP on Raabin-WBC.

Existing advanced works mainly focus on analyzing the intrinsic characteristics of the entire features extracted by each pre-trained model or how well such features fit the target labels. This paper proposes a novel perspective for pre-trained model assessment through the Distribution of Spectral Components (DISCO). Through singular value decomposition of features extracted from pre-trained models, we investigate different spectral components and observe that they possess distinct transferability, contributing diversely to the fine-tuning performance. Inspired by this, we propose an assessment method based on the distribution of spectral components which measures the proportions of their corresponding singular values. Pre-trained models with features concentrating on more transferable components are regarded as better choices for transfer learning. We further leverage the labels of downstream data to better estimate the transferability of each spectral component and derive the final assessment criterion. Our proposed method is flexible and can be applied to both classification and regression tasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments across three benchmarks and two tasks including image classification and object detection, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in choosing proper pre-trained models from the model hub for transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing open-vocabulary detectors, primarily trained on natural-world images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing images due to a significant data domain gap. Thus, this paper aims to advance the development of open-vocabulary object detection in remote sensing community. To achieve this, we first reformulate the task as Locate Anything on Earth (LAE) with the goal of detecting any novel concepts on Earth. We then developed the LAE-Label Engine which collects, auto-annotates, and unifies up to 10 remote sensing datasets creating the LAE-1M - the first large-scale remote sensing object detection dataset with broad category coverage. Using the LAE-1M, we further propose and train the novel LAE-DINO Model, the first open-vocabulary foundation object detector for the LAE task, featuring Dynamic Vocabulary Construction (DVC) and Visual-Guided Text Prompt Learning (VisGT) modules. DVC dynamically constructs vocabulary for each training batch, while VisGT maps visual features to semantic space, enhancing text features. We comprehensively conduct experiments on established remote sensing benchmark DIOR, DOTAv2.0, as well as our newly introduced 80-class LAE-80C benchmark. Results demonstrate the advantages of the LAE-1M dataset and the effectiveness of the LAE-DINO method.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures | None |

Conventional label-efficient methods focus on object-centric features, neglecting contextual semantic relationships that are critical in complex scenes. In this work, we propose a Context-Aware Weak Supervision for Monocular 3D object detection, namely CA-W3D, to address this limitation in a two-stage training paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a pre-training stage employing Region-wise Object Contrastive Matching (ROCM), which aligns regional object embeddings derived from a trainable monocular 3D encoder and a frozen open-vocabulary 2D visual grounding model. This alignment encourages the monocular encoder to discriminate scene-specific attributes and acquire richer contextual knowledge. In the second stage, we incorporate a pseudo-label training process with a Dual-to-One Distillation (D2OD) mechanism, which effectively transfers contextual priors into the monocular encoder while preserving spatial fidelity and maintaining computational efficiency during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on the public KITTI benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing the SoTA method over all metrics, highlighting the importance of contextual-aware knowledge in weakly-supervised monocular 3D detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper includes 8 pages, 6 figures and 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Environments with dynamic and unpredictable elements like construction sites are especially challenging. Construction sites introduce hazards like uneven surfaces, obstructive barriers, hazardous materials, and excessive noise, and they can alter routing, complicating safe mobility. Existing assistive technologies are limited, as navigation apps do not account for construction sites during trip planning, and detection tools that attempt hazard recognition struggle to address the extreme variability of construction paraphernalia. This study introduces a novel computer vision-based system that integrates open-vocabulary object detection, a YOLO-based scaffolding-pole detection model, and an optical character recognition (OCR) module to comprehensively identify and interpret construction site elements for assistive navigation.

| **[Fractional Correspondence Framework in Detection Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04107v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Detection Transformer (DETR), by incorporating the Hungarian algorithm, has significantly simplified the matching process in object detection tasks. This algorithm facilitates optimal one-to-one matching of predicted bounding boxes to ground-truth annotations during training. While effective, this strict matching process does not inherently account for the varying densities and distributions of objects, leading to suboptimal correspondences such as failing to handle multiple detections of the same object or missing small objects. To address this, we propose the Regularized Transport Plan (RTP). RTP introduces a flexible matching strategy that captures the cost of aligning predictions with ground truths to find the most accurate correspondences between these sets. By utilizing the differentiable Sinkhorn algorithm, RTP allows for soft, fractional matching rather than strict one-to-one assignments.

Traditionally, human inspection has been used for detection, a slow and labour-intensive process. Recent research has applied machine learning techniques to this problem, yet there remains a shortage of high-quality, publicly available datasets. This paper introduces a synthetic dataset featuring diverse backgrounds, interfering foreground objects, diverse leak locations, and precise segmentation ground truth. We propose a zero-shot method that combines background subtraction, zero-shot object detection, filtering, and segmentation to leverage this dataset. Experimental results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods based solely on background subtraction and zero-shot object detection with segmentation, reaching an IoU of 69\% overall. We also present an analysis of various prompt configurations and threshold settings to provide deeper insights into the performance of our method. The code and dataset will be released after publication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fractal Calibration for long-tailed object detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11774v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world datasets follow an imbalanced distribution, which poses significant challenges in rare-category object detection. Recent studies tackle this problem by developing re-weighting and re-sampling methods, that utilise the class frequencies of the dataset. However, these techniques focus solely on the frequency statistics and ignore the distribution of the classes in image space, missing important information. In contrast to them, we propose FRActal CALibration (FRACAL): a novel post-calibration method for long-tailed object detection. FRACAL devises a logit adjustment method that utilises the fractal dimension to estimate how uniformly classes are distributed in image space. During inference, it uses the fractal dimension to inversely downweight the probabilities of uniformly spaced class predictions achieving balance in two axes: between frequent and rare categories, and between uniformly spaced and sparsely spaced classes. FRACAL is a post-processing method and it does not require any training, also it can be combined with many off-the-shelf models such as one-stage sigmoid detectors and two-stage instance segmentation models. FRACAL boosts the rare class performance by up to 8.6% and surpasses all previous methods on LVIS dataset, while showing good generalisation to other datasets such as COCO, V3Det and OpenImages. We provide the code at https://github.com/kostas1515/FRACAL.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/kostas1515/FRACAL) |

Existing methods predominantly rely on 3D bounding boxes and BEV road maps for foreground and background control, which fail to capture the full complexity of driving scenes and adequately integrate multimodal information. In this work, we present DualDiff, a dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance driving scene generation across multiple views and video sequences. Specifically, we introduce Occupancy Ray-shape Sampling (ORS) as a conditional input, offering rich foreground and background semantics alongside 3D spatial geometry to precisely control the generation of both elements. To improve the synthesis of fine-grained foreground objects, particularly complex and distant ones, we propose a Foreground-Aware Mask (FGM) denoising loss function. Additionally, we develop the Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism to dynamically prioritize relevant information and suppress noise, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Finally, to ensure high-quality image-to-video generation, we introduce the Reward-Guided Diffusion (RGD) framework, which maintains global consistency and semantic coherence in generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets. On the NuScenes dataset, DualDiff reduces the FID score by 4.09% compared to the best baseline. In downstream tasks, such as BEV segmentation, our method improves vehicle mIoU by 4.50% and road mIoU by 1.70%, while in BEV 3D object detection, the foreground mAP increases by 1.46%.

However, directly applying GT-Aug to 4D Radar tensor data overlooks important measurements outside the GT bboxes-such as sidelobes-leading to synthetic distributions that deviate from real-world 4D Radar data. To address this limitation, we propose 4D Radar Ground Truth Augmentation (4DR GT-Aug). Our approach first augments LiDAR data and then converts it to 4D Radar data via a LiDAR-to-4D Radar data synthesis (L2RDaS) module, which explicitly accounts for measurements both inside and outside GT bboxes. In doing so, it produces 4D Radar data distributions that more closely resemble real-world measurements, thereby improving object detection accuracy. Experiments on the K-Radar dataset show that the proposed method achieves improved performance compared to conventional GT-Aug in object detection for 4D Radar. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/kaist-avelab/K-Radar.</p></details> | 24 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/kaist-avelab/K-Radar) |

While You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm, factors like training data quality and adverse weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain) can lead to detection failures. These failures can be particularly dangerous when visual similarities between objects exist, such as mistaking a 30 km/h sign for a higher speed limit sign. This paper proposes a method that combines video analysis and reasoning, prompting with a human-in-the-loop guide large vision model to improve YOLOs accuracy in detecting road speed limit signs, especially in semi-real-world conditions. It is hypothesized that the guided prompting and reasoning abilities of Video-LLava can enhance YOLOs traffic sign detection capabilities. This hypothesis is supported by an evaluation based on human-annotated accuracy metrics within a dataset of recorded videos from the CARLA car simulator. The results demonstrate that a collaborative approach combining YOLO with Video-LLava and reasoning can effectively address challenging situations such as heavy rain and overcast conditions that hinder YOLOs detection capabilities.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, robots often need to operate in different domains from those they were trained in, requiring them to adjust to these changes. Tiny mobile robots, subject to size, power, and computational constraints, encounter even more difficulties in running and adapting these algorithms. Such adaptability, though, is crucial for real-world deployment, where robots must operate effectively in dynamic and unpredictable settings. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark to evaluate the continual learning capabilities of object detection systems in tiny robotic platforms. Our contributions include: (i) Tiny Robotics Object Detection~(TiROD), a comprehensive dataset collected using the onboard camera of a small mobile robot, designed to test object detectors across various domains and classes; (ii) a benchmark of different continual learning strategies on this dataset using NanoDet, a lightweight object detector. Our results highlight key challenges in developing robust and efficient continual learning strategies for object detectors in tiny robotics.</p></details> |  | None |

In air disc brake manufacturing, ensuring the precision of laser-engraved nameplates is crucial for accurate product identification and quality control. Engraving errors, such as misprints or missing characters, can compromise both aesthetics and functionality, leading to material waste and production delays. This paper presents a proof of concept for an AI-driven computer vision system that inspects and verifies laser-engraved nameplates, detecting defects in logos and alphanumeric strings. The system integrates object detection using YOLOv7, optical character recognition (OCR) with Tesseract, and anomaly detection through a residual variational autoencoder (ResVAE) along with other computer vision methods to enable comprehensive inspections at multiple stages. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness, achieving 91.33% accuracy and 100% recall, ensuring that defective nameplates are consistently detected and addressed. This solution highlights the potential of AI-driven visual inspection to enhance quality control, reduce manual inspection efforts, and improve overall manufacturing efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the lack of efficient training algorithms has hindered their widespread adoption. Even efficient ANN-SNN conversion methods necessitate quantized training of ANNs to enhance the effectiveness of the conversion, incurring additional training costs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient ANN-SNN conversion framework with only inference scale complexity. The conversion framework includes a local threshold balancing algorithm, which enables efficient calculation of the optimal thresholds and fine-grained adjustment of the threshold value by channel-wise scaling. We also introduce an effective delayed evaluation strategy to mitigate the influence of the spike propagation delays. We demonstrate the scalability of our framework in typical computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and video classification. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods, highlighting its practical applicability and efficiency. Moreover, we have evaluated the energy consumption of the converted SNNs, demonstrating their superior low-power advantage compared to conventional ANNs. This approach simplifies the deployment of SNNs by leveraging open-source pre-trained ANN models, enabling fast, low-power inference with negligible performance reduction.

However, this task has received relatively limited exploration when compared to object detection and segmentation with only a few recent vision-based approaches presenting preliminary findings that significantly deteriorate in low-light, nighttime, and adverse weather conditions such as rain. Conversely, LiDAR and radar sensors remain almost unaffected in these scenarios, and radar provides key velocity information of the objects. Therefore, we introduce BEVMOSNet, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end multimodal fusion leveraging cameras, LiDAR, and radar to precisely predict the moving objects in BEV. In addition, we perform a deeper analysis to find out the optimal strategy for deformable cross-attention-guided sensor fusion for cross-sensor knowledge sharing in BEV. While evaluating BEVMOSNet on the nuScenes dataset, we show an overall improvement in IoU score of 36.59% compared to the vision-based unimodal baseline BEV-MoSeg (Sigatapu et al., 2023), and 2.35% compared to the multimodel SimpleBEV (Harley et al., 2022), extended for the motion segmentation task, establishing this method as the state-of-the-art in BEV motion segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications (2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Scale-Invariant Object Detection by Adaptive Convolution with Unified Global-Local Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05274v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense features are important for detecting minute objects in images. Unfortunately, despite the remarkable efficacy of the CNN models in multi-scale object detection, CNN models often fail to detect smaller objects in images due to the loss of dense features during the pooling process. Atrous convolution addresses this issue by applying sparse kernels. However, sparse kernels often can lose the multi-scale detection efficacy of the CNN model. In this paper, we propose an object detection model using a Switchable (adaptive) Atrous Convolutional Network (SAC-Net) based on the efficientDet model. A fixed atrous rate limits the performance of the CNN models in the convolutional layers. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a switchable mechanism that allows for dynamically adjusting the atrous rate during the forward pass. The proposed SAC-Net encapsulates the benefits of both low-level and high-level features to achieve improved performance on multi-scale object detection tasks, without losing the dense features. Further, we apply a depth-wise switchable atrous rate to the proposed network, to improve the scale-invariant features. Finally, we apply global context on the proposed model. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAC-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a significant margin in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

LiDAR, as a commonly used sensor in cooperative perception, is widely equipped in intelligent vehicles and infrastructure. However, its superior performance comes with a correspondingly high cost. To achieve low-cost V2I, reducing the cost of LiDAR is crucial. Therefore, we study adopting low-resolution LiDAR on the vehicle to minimize cost as much as possible. However, simply reducing the resolution of vehicle's LiDAR results in sparse point clouds, making distant small objects even more blurred. Additionally, traditional communication methods have relatively low bandwidth utilization efficiency. These factors pose challenges for us. To balance cost and perceptual accuracy, we propose a new collaborative perception framework, namely LCV2I. LCV2I uses data collected from cameras and low-resolution LiDAR as input. It also employs feature offset correction modules and regional feature enhancement algorithms to improve feature representation. Finally, we use regional difference map and regional score map to assess the value of collaboration content, thereby improving communication bandwidth efficiency. In summary, our approach achieves high perceptual performance while substantially reducing the demand for high-resolution sensors on the vehicle. To evaluate this algorithm, we conduct 3D object detection in the real-world scenario of DAIR-V2X, demonstrating that the performance of LCV2I consistently surpasses currently existing algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Periodontal Bone Loss Analysis via Keypoint Detection With Heuristic Post-Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13477v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calculating percentage bone loss is a critical test for periodontal disease staging but is sometimes imprecise and time consuming when manually calculated. This study evaluates the application of a deep learning keypoint and object detection model, YOLOv8-pose, for the automatic identification of localised periodontal bone loss landmarks, conditions and staging. YOLOv8-pose was fine-tuned on 193 annotated periapical radiographs. We propose a keypoint detection metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), which normalises the metric to the average tooth size of teeth in the image. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that adjusts certain keypoint predictions to align with the edge of the related tooth, using a supporting instance segmentation model trained on an open source auxiliary dataset. The model can sufficiently detect bone loss keypoints, tooth boxes, and alveolar ridge resorption, but has insufficient performance at detecting detached periodontal ligament and furcation involvement. The model with post-processing demonstrated a PRCK 0.25 of 0.726 and PRCK 0.05 of 0.401 for keypoint detection, mAP 0.5 of 0.715 for tooth object detection, mesial dice score of 0.593 for periodontal staging, and dice score of 0.280 for furcation involvement. Our annotation methodology provides a stage agnostic approach to periodontal disease detection, by ensuring most keypoints are present for each tooth in the image, allowing small imbalanced datasets. Our PRCK metric allows accurate evaluation of keypoints in dental domains. Our post-processing module adjusts predicted keypoints correctly but is dependent on a minimum quality of prediction by the pose detection and segmentation models.

Recently, many MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly target LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA methods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these techniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular distribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar setups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware PillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar level in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a single mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to each pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different classes, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large vehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse objects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This class-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new information, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance but also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street and K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will spark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, submitted to 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, real-world scenarios often deviate from ideal symmetric systems caused by physical permutation, characterized by non-trivial actions of a symmetry group, resulting in asymmetries that affect the outputs, a phenomenon known as Symmetry Breaking. Traditional GConv-based methods are constrained by rigid operational rules within group space, assuming data remains strictly symmetry after limited group transformations. This limitation makes it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking and non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we mainly focus on a common scenario: Rotational Symmetry-Breaking. By relaxing strict group transformations within Strict Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{C}_n$, we redefine a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{R}_n$ and introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant GConv (R2GConv) with only a minimal increase of $4n$ parameters compared to GConv. Based on R2GConv, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and develop a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Object Detector (R2Det) for 2D object detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed R2GConv in natural image classification, and R2Det achieves excellent performance in 2D object detection with improved generalization capabilities and robustness.

An intuitive question arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state estimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse illumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A pivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as stable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep space aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we propose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation framework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile localization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual methods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level metrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves as a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective propagation and utilization of object map information within the system. Night-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global localization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data association, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using map-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties in visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a feature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both simulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km), Night-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a critical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> | None |

In contrast to CL for image classification, CL for Object Detection faces additional challenges such as the missing annotations problem. In this scenario, images from previous tasks may contain instances of unknown classes that could reappear as labeled in future tasks, leading to task interference in replay-based approaches. Consequently, most approaches in the literature have focused on distillation-based techniques, which are effective when there is a significant class overlap between tasks. In our work, we propose an alternative to distillation-based approaches with a novel approach called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD). RCLPOD enhances the replay memory by improving the quality of the stored samples through a technique that promotes class balance while also improving the quality of the ground truth associated with these samples through a technique called label propagation. RCLPOD outperforms existing techniques on well-established benchmarks such as VOC and COC. Moreover, our approach is developed to work with modern architectures like YOLOv8, making it suitable for dynamic, real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, where continuous learning and resource efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach is evaluated on two state-of-the-art object detection models, YOLO11(l) and RT-DETR(l), using the mAP50 metric to assess detection performance. We explore quantization strategies (FP16 and INT8) for both the generative inpainting and detection models to strike a balance between inference speed and accuracy.

While standard methods employ a frame-based, multi-label approach, we introduce an onset-based detection method which we name Voxaboxen. It takes inspiration from object detection methods in computer vision, but simultaneously takes advantage of recent advances in self-supervised audio encoders. For each time window, Voxaboxen predicts whether it contains the start of a vocalization and how long the vocalization is. It also does the same in reverse, predicting whether each window contains the end of a vocalization, and how long ago it started. The two resulting sets of bounding boxes are then fused using a graph-matching algorithm. We also release a new dataset designed to measure performance on detecting overlapping vocalizations. This consists of recordings of zebra finches annotated with temporally-strong labels and showing frequent overlaps. We test Voxaboxen on seven existing data sets and on our new data set. We compare Voxaboxen to natural baselines and existing sound event detection methods and demonstrate SotA results. Further experiments show that improvements are robust to frequent vocalization overlap.</p></details> |  | None |

The ISB module innovatively reconstructs feature maps to establish an efficient full-channel global attention mechanism through synergistic fusion of batch-statistical and instance-specific features. Complementing this, the ISADH module pioneers an asymmetric decoupled architecture enabling hierarchical multi-dimensional feature integration via dual-stream batch-instance representation fusion. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the coordinated deployment of ISB and ISADH in the YOLO-PRO framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all computational scales. Specifically, YOLO-PRO surpasses YOLOv8 by 1.0-1.6% AP (N/S/M/L/X scales) and outperforms YOLO11 by 0.1-0.5% AP in critical M/L/X groups, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

However, existing methods struggle to capture global dependency across modalities, lack comprehensive saliency priors from both RGB and depth data, and are ineffective in handling low-quality depth maps. To address these challenges, we propose SSNet, a saliency-prior and state space model (SSM)-based network for the RGB-D SOD task. Unlike existing convolution- or transformer-based approaches, SSNet introduces an SSM-based multi-modal multi-scale decoder module to efficiently capture both intra- and inter-modal global dependency with linear complexity. Specifically, we propose a cross-modal selective scan SSM (CM-S6) mechanism, which effectively captures global dependency between different modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency enhancement module (SEM) that integrates three saliency priors with deep features to refine feature representation and improve the localization of salient objects. To further address the issue of low-quality depth maps, we propose an adaptive contrast enhancement technique that dynamically refines depth maps, making them more suitable for the RGB-D SOD task. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised learning, which faces significant challenges: the requirement for extensive labeled training data and lack of interpretability in decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we present a training-free framework that integrates open-set object detection with symbolic regression, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient symbolic pattern discovery. The LLMs guide the symbolic reasoning process, establishing logical relationships between detected entities. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains, our framework demonstrates several key advantages: (1) achieving superior detection accuracy through direct reasoning without any training process; (2) providing highly interpretable logical expressions that are readily comprehensible to humans; and (3) requiring minimal annotation effort - approximately 1% of the data needed by traditional training-based methods.To facilitate comprehensive evaluation and future research, we introduce two datasets: a large-scale private dataset containing over 110,000 annotated images covering various anomaly scenarios including construction site safety violations, illegal fishing activities, and industrial hazards, along with a public benchmark dataset of 5,000 samples with detailed anomaly event annotations.

| **[VoxelNextFusion: A Simple, Unified and Effective Voxel Fusion Framework for Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02702v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-camera fusion can enhance the performance of 3D object detection by utilizing complementary information between depth-aware LiDAR points and semantically rich images. Existing voxel-based methods face significant challenges when fusing sparse voxel features with dense image features in a one-to-one manner, resulting in the loss of the advantages of images, including semantic and continuity information, leading to sub-optimal detection performance, especially at long distances. In this paper, we present VoxelNextFusion, a multi-modal 3D object detection framework specifically designed for voxel-based methods, which effectively bridges the gap between sparse point clouds and dense images. In particular, we propose a voxel-based image pipeline that involves projecting point clouds onto images to obtain both pixel- and patch-level features. These features are then fused using a self-attention to obtain a combined representation. Moreover, to address the issue of background features present in patches, we propose a feature importance module that effectively distinguishes between foreground and background features, thus minimizing the impact of the background features. Extensive experiments were conducted on the widely used KITTI and nuScenes 3D object detection benchmarks. Notably, our VoxelNextFusion achieved around +3.20% in AP@0.7 improvement for car detection in hard level compared to the Voxel R-CNN baseline on the KITTI test dataset</p></details> |  | None |

This dataset not only supports several key tasks such as visual understanding and object detection tasks, but also has unique innovative aspects: this study develop a visual-language dataset and benchmark for the SAR domain, enabling and evaluating VLMs' capabilities in SAR image interpretation, which provides a paradigmatic framework for constructing multimodal datasets across various remote sensing vertical domains.

As a result, a growing need for efficient compression methods optimized for machine vision, rather than human vision, has emerged. To meet this growing demand, several methods have been developed for image and video coding for machines. Unfortunately, while there is a substantial body of knowledge regarding rate-distortion theory for human vision, the same cannot be said of machine analysis. In this paper, we extend the current rate-distortion theory for machines, providing insight into important design considerations of machine-vision codecs. We then utilize this newfound understanding to improve several methods for learnable image coding for machines. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several computer vision tasks such as classification, instance segmentation, and object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

This task remains challenging due to complex variations in real-world applications. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diverse scene generation, which inspires us to explore their potential for improving DG tasks. Instead of generating images, our method extracts multi-step intermediate features during the diffusion process to obtain domain-invariant features for generalized detection. Furthermore, we propose an efficient knowledge transfer framework that enables detectors to inherit the generalization capabilities of diffusion models through feature and object-level alignment, without increasing inference time. We conduct extensive experiments on six challenging DG benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements of 14.0% mAP over existing DG approaches across different domains and corruption types. Notably, our method even outperforms most domain adaptation methods without accessing any target domain data. Moreover, the diffusion-guided detectors show consistent improvements of 15.9% mAP on average compared to the baseline. Our work aims to present an effective approach for domain-generalized detection and provide potential insights for robust visual recognition in real-world scenarios.

While deep learning models show promise in recognizing and classifying homogenous materials, the current literature lacks research assessing their performance for mixed, contaminated material in commercial material recycling facility settings. Despite the increasing numbers of deep learning models and datasets generated in this area, the sub-domain of deep learning analysis of construction and demolition waste piles remains underexplored. To address this gap, recent deep learning algorithms and techniques were explored. This review examines the progression in datasets, sensors and the evolution from object detection towards real-time segmentation models. It also synthesizes research from the past five years on deep learning for construction and demolition waste management, highlighting recent advancements while acknowledging limitations that hinder widespread commercial adoption. The analysis underscores the critical requirement for diverse and high-fidelity datasets, advanced sensor technologies, and robust algorithmic frameworks to facilitate the effective integration of deep learning methodologies into construction and demolition waste management systems. This integration is envisioned to contribute significantly towards the advancement of a more sustainable and circular economic model.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional approaches, such as RGB histograms and GIST descriptors, often fail in complex scenarios due to their sensitivity to illumination changes. This study introduces a novel method utilizing the Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, to estimate illuminant and light direction in images. Experiments on diverse images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement.

Recent open-source work like DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward is one key direction in reproducing o1. While the R1-style model has demonstrated success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains remains under-explored. This work introduces Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT), which further extends the application areas of RFT on visual tasks. Specifically, Visual-RFT first uses Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multiple responses containing reasoning tokens and final answers for each input, and then uses our proposed visual perception verifiable reward functions to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We design different verifiable reward functions for different perception tasks, such as the Intersection over Union (IoU) reward for object detection. Experimental results on fine-grained image classification, few-shot object detection, reasoning grounding, as well as open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced generalization ability of Visual-RFT compared with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). For example, Visual-RFT improves accuracy by $24.3\%$ over the baseline in one-shot fine-grained image classification with around 100 samples. In few-shot object detection, Visual-RFT also exceeds the baseline by $21.9$ on COCO's two-shot setting and $15.4$ on LVIS. Our Visual-RFT represents a paradigm shift in fine-tuning LVLMs, offering a data-efficient, reward-driven approach that enhances reasoning and adaptability for domain-specific tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://github.com/Liuziyu77/Visual-RFT</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Liuziyu77/Visual-RFT) |

However, various types of noise in sonar images can affect the accuracy of object detection. Denoising, as a critical preprocessing step, aims to remove noise while retaining useful information to improve detection accuracy. Although deep learning-based denoising algorithms perform well on optical images, their application to underwater sonar images remains underexplored. This paper systematically evaluates the effectiveness of several deep learning-based denoising algorithms, originally designed for optical images, in the context of underwater sonar image object detection. We apply nine trained denoising models to images from five open-source sonar datasets, each processing different types of noise. We then test the denoised images using four object detection algorithms. The results show that different denoising models have varying effects on detection performance. By combining the strengths of multiple denoising models, the detection results can be optimized, thus more effectively suppressing noise. Additionally, we adopt a multi-frame denoising technique, using different outputs generated by multiple denoising models as multiple frames of the same scene for further processing to enhance detection accuracy. This method, originally designed for optical images, leverages complementary noise-reduction effects. Experimental results show that denoised sonar images improve the performance of object detection algorithms compared to the original sonar images.</p></details> |  | None |

Investigating the adversarial robustness of embodied vision navigation is crucial, especially given the threat of 3D physical attacks that could pose risks to human safety. However, existing attack methods for embodied vision navigation often lack physical feasibility due to challenges in transferring digital perturbations into the physical world. Moreover, current physical attacks for object detection struggle to achieve both multi-view effectiveness and visual naturalness in navigation scenarios. To address this, we propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching adversarial patches to objects, where both opacity and textures are learnable. Specifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a multi-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which optimizes the patch's texture based on feedback from the vision-based perception model used in navigation. To make the patch inconspicuous to human observers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, in which opacity is fine-tuned after texture optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our adversarial patches decrease the navigation success rate by an average of 22.39%, outperforming previous methods in practicality, effectiveness, and naturalness.

Here we used a speculative prototyping approach to explore this expansive design space: First, we identified some potential challenges of interest, including crimes and illnesses that disproportionately affect women, as well as potential opportunities for designers, which were visualized in five sketches. Then, one of the sketched scenarios was further explored by developing a prototype, of a robotic helper drone equipped with computer vision to detect hidden cameras that could be used to spy on women. While object detection introduced some errors, hidden cameras were identified with a reasonable accuracy of 80% (Intersection over Union (IoU) score: 0.40). Our aim is that the identified challenges and opportunities could help spark discussion and inspire designers, toward realizing a safer, more inclusive future through responsible use of technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Accepted Version of a Published Conference Paper in 14th Scandinavian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (SCAI 2024): AI for a better society, June 10-11, 2024, J\"onk\"oping, Sweden, Link\"oping Electronic Conference Proceedings (ECP) ISSN: 1650-3740 (CC BY 4.0 License)</p></details> | None |

This study focuses on developing an intelligent algorithm which can navigate a robot through a kitchen, recognizing objects, and tracking their relocation. The kitchen was chosen as the testing ground due to its dynamic nature as objects are frequently moved, rearranged and replaced. Various techniques, such as SLAM feature-based tracking and deep learning-based object detection (e.g., Faster R-CNN), are commonly used for object tracking. Additionally, methods such as optical flow analysis and 3D reconstruction have also been used to track the relocation of objects. These approaches often face challenges when it comes to problems such as lighting variations and partial occlusions, where parts of the object are hidden in some frames but visible in others. The proposed method in this study leverages the YOLOv5 architecture, initialized with pre-trained weights and subsequently fine-tuned on a custom dataset. A novel method was developed, introducing a frame-scoring algorithm which calculates a score for each object based on its location and features within all frames. This scoring approach helps to identify changes by determining the best-associated frame for each object and comparing the results in each scene, overcoming limitations seen in other methods while maintaining simplicity in design. The experimental results demonstrate an accuracy of 97.72%, a precision of 95.83% and a recall of 96.84% for this algorithm, which highlights the efficacy of the model in detecting spatial changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference: 2024 14th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE) Publisher: IEEE</p></details> | None |

The cascaded decoder architecture constrains object queries to update in the cascaded direction, only enabling object queries to learn relatively-limited information from image features. However, the challenges for object detection in natural scenes (e.g., extremely-small, heavily-occluded, and confusingly mixed with the background) require an object detection model to fully utilize image features, which motivates us to propose a new decoder architecture with the parallel Multi-time Inquiries (MI) mechanism. MI enables object queries to learn more comprehensive information, and our MI based model, MI-DETR, outperforms all existing DETR-like models on COCO benchmark under different backbones and training epochs, achieving +2.3 AP and +0.6 AP improvements compared to the most representative model DINO and SOTA model Relation-DETR under ResNet-50 backbone.

HiBug2 first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, HiBug2 extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that HiBug2 not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the potential of recent vision-based methods, they encounter challenges under adverse conditions. Thus, integrating cameras with next-generation 4D imaging radar to achieve unified multi-task perception is highly significant, though research in this domain remains limited. In this paper, we propose Doracamom, the first framework that fuses multi-view cameras and 4D radar for joint 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive environmental perception. Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality.

This paper introduces ClipGrader, a novel approach that leverages vision-language models to automatically assess the accuracy of bounding box annotations. By adapting CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) to evaluate both class label correctness and spatial precision of bounding box, ClipGrader offers an effective solution for grading object detection labels. Tested on modified object detection datasets with artificially disturbed bounding boxes, ClipGrader achieves 91% accuracy on COCO with a 1.8% false positive rate. Moreover, it maintains 87% accuracy with a 2.1% false positive rate when trained on just 10% of the COCO data. ClipGrader also scales effectively to larger datasets such as LVIS, achieving 79% accuracy across 1,203 classes. Our experiments demonstrate ClipGrader's ability to identify errors in existing COCO annotations, highlighting its potential for dataset refinement. When integrated into a semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) model, ClipGrader readily improves the pseudo label quality, helping achieve higher mAP (mean Average Precision) throughout the training process. ClipGrader thus provides a scalable AI-assisted tool for enhancing annotation quality control and verifying annotations in large-scale object detection datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

By leveraging the complementary capabilities of LiDAR and camera sensors, ICanC improves detection accuracy under conditions where camera performance typically declines, while significantly reducing unnecessary headlight usage. This approach aligns with the broader objective of promoting sustainable transportation. ICanC comprises three primary nodes: the Obstacle Detector, which processes LiDAR point cloud data to fit bounding boxes onto detected objects and estimate their position, velocity, and orientation; the Danger Detector, which evaluates potential threats using the information provided by the Obstacle Detector; and the Light Controller, which dynamically activates headlights to enhance camera visibility solely when a threat is detected. Experiments conducted in physical and simulated environments demonstrate ICanC's robust performance, even in the presence of significant noise interference. The system consistently achieves high accuracy in camera-based object detection when headlights are engaged, while significantly reducing overall headlight energy consumption. These results position ICanC as a promising advancement in autonomous vehicle research, achieving a balance between energy efficiency and reliable object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 18 figures, to be published in IEEE MOST 2025</p></details> | None |

Moreo-ver, the trade-off between model accuracy and computational complexity poses additional constraints on the application of RSOD algorithms. To address these issues, this study proposes an efficient and lightweight RSOD algorithm integrat-ing multi-scale receptive fields and foreground focus mechanism, named RFWNet.

Additionally, we developed a Foreground Background Separation Module (FBSM) consisting of a background redundant information filtering module and a foreground information enhancement module to emphasize critical regions within images while filtering redundant background information. Finally, we designed a loss function, the Weighted CIoU-Wasserstein (WCW) loss, which weights the IoU-based loss by using the Normalized Wasserstein Distance to mitigate model sensitivity to small object position deviations. Experimental evaluations on the DOTA V1.0 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets demonstrate that RFWNet achieves advanced perfor-mance with 6.0M parameters and can achieves 52 FPS.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper shows that large strip convolutions are good feature representation learners for remote sensing object detection and can detect objects of various aspect ratios well. Based on large strip convolutions, we build a new network architecture called Strip R-CNN, which is simple, efficient, and powerful. Unlike recent remote sensing object detectors that leverage large-kernel convolutions with square shapes, our Strip R-CNN takes advantage of sequential orthogonal large strip convolutions in our backbone network StripNet to capture spatial information. In addition, we improve the localization capability of remote-sensing object detectors by decoupling the detection heads and equipping the localization branch with strip convolutions in our strip head. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks, for example DOTA, FAIR1M, HRSC2016, and DIOR, show that our Strip R-CNN can greatly improve previous work. In particular, our 30M model achieves 82.75% mAP on DOTA-v1.0, setting a new state-of-the-art record. Our code will be made publicly available.Code is available at https://github.com/YXB-NKU/Strip-R-CNN.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/YXB-NKU/Strip-R-CNN) |
| **[A Survey of Adversarial Defenses in Vision-based Systems: Categorization, Methods and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00384v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks have emerged as a major challenge to the trustworthy deployment of machine learning models, particularly in computer vision applications. These attacks have a varied level of potency and can be implemented in both white box and black box approaches. Practical attacks include methods to manipulate the physical world and enforce adversarial behaviour by the corresponding target neural network models. Multiple different approaches to mitigate different kinds of such attacks are available in the literature, each with their own advantages and limitations. In this survey, we present a comprehensive systematization of knowledge on adversarial defenses, focusing on two key computer vision tasks: image classification and object detection. We review the state-of-the-art adversarial defense techniques and categorize them for easier comparison. In addition, we provide a schematic representation of these categories within the context of the overall machine learning pipeline, facilitating clearer understanding and benchmarking of defenses. Furthermore, we map these defenses to the types of adversarial attacks and datasets where they are most effective, offering practical insights for researchers and practitioners. This study is necessary for understanding the scope of how the available defenses are able to address the adversarial threats, and their shortcomings as well, which is necessary for driving the research in this area in the most appropriate direction, with the aim of building trustworthy AI systems for regular practical use-cases.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PaliGemma-CXR: A Multi-task Multimodal Model for TB Chest X-ray Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00171v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a infectious global health challenge. Chest X-rays are a standard method for TB screening, yet many countries face a critical shortage of radiologists capable of interpreting these images. Machine learning offers an alternative, as it can automate tasks such as disease diagnosis, and report generation. However, traditional approaches rely on task-specific models, which cannot utilize the interdependence between tasks. Building a multi-task model capable of performing multiple tasks poses additional challenges such as scarcity of multimodal data, dataset imbalance, and negative transfer. To address these challenges, we propose PaliGemma-CXR, a multi-task multimodal model capable of performing TB diagnosis, object detection, segmentation, report generation, and VQA. Starting with a dataset of chest X-ray images annotated with TB diagnosis labels and segmentation masks, we curated a multimodal dataset to support additional tasks. By finetuning PaliGemma on this dataset and sampling data using ratios of the inverse of the size of task datasets, we achieved the following results across all tasks: 90.32% accuracy on TB diagnosis and 98.95% on close-ended VQA, 41.3 BLEU score on report generation, and a mAP of 19.4 and 16.0 on object detection and segmentation, respectively. These results demonstrate that PaliGemma-CXR effectively leverages the interdependence between multiple image interpretation tasks to enhance performance.</p></details> |  | None |
