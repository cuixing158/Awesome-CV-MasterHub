Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under consideration at Image and Vision Computing</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Large Scale Geostatistical Methane Monitoring with Part-based Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18513v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France. We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these infrastructures in a given area at a given time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Human Scanpath Prediction in Target-Present Visual Search with Semantic-Foveal Bayesian Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18503v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search. SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18 benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL)</p></details> | None |
| **[A COCO-Formatted Instance-Level Dataset for Plasmodium Falciparum Detection in Giemsa-Stained Blood Smears](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18483v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1 scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub: https://github.com/MIRA-Vision-Microscopy/malaria-thin-smear-coco.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, accepted at MICCAI 2025 Open Data</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/MIRA-Vision-Microscopy/malaria-thin-smear-coco) |
| **[Revisiting Physically Realizable Adversarial Object Attack against LiDAR-based Detection: Clarifying Problem Formulation and Experimental Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18457v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosting Multi-View Indoor 3D Object Detection via Adaptive 3D Volume Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18331v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes datasets.

| **[LMM-Det: Make Large Multimodal Models Excel in Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18300v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection, revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det.

| **[Real-Time Object Detection and Classification using YOLO for Edge FPGAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18174v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection and classification are crucial tasks across various application domains, particularly in the development of safe and reliable Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of accuracy and computational speed when deployed on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, despite these advances, state-of-the-art YOLO-based object detection and classification systems continue to face challenges in achieving resource efficiency suitable for edge FPGA platforms. To address this limitation, this paper presents a resource-efficient real-time object detection and classification system based on YOLOv5 optimized for FPGA deployment. The proposed system is trained on the COCO and GTSRD datasets and implemented on the Xilinx Kria KV260 FPGA board. Experimental results demonstrate a classification accuracy of 99%, with a power consumption of 3.5W and a processing speed of 9 frames per second (FPS). These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling real-time, resource-efficient object detection and classification for edge computing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the 67th International Symposium on ELMAR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[WaveMamba: Wavelet-Driven Mamba Fusion for RGB-Infrared Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18173v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results. The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB), which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands. Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CutS3D: Cutting Semantics in 3D for 2D Unsupervised Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16319v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, algorithms that learn to segment object instances in 2D images have heavily relied on large amounts of human-annotated data. Only recently, novel approaches have emerged tackling this problem in an unsupervised fashion. Generally, these approaches first generate pseudo-masks and then train a class-agnostic detector. While such methods deliver the current state of the art, they often fail to correctly separate instances overlapping in 2D image space since only semantics are considered. To tackle this issue, we instead propose to cut the semantic masks in 3D to obtain the final 2D instances by utilizing a point cloud representation of the scene. Furthermore, we derive a Spatial Importance function, which we use to resharpen the semantics along the 3D borders of instances. Nevertheless, these pseudo-masks are still subject to mask ambiguity. To address this issue, we further propose to augment the training of a class-agnostic detector with three Spatial Confidence components aiming to isolate a clean learning signal. With these contributions, our approach outperforms competing methods across multiple standard benchmarks for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

| **[OpenNav: Open-World Navigation with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18033v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly, leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and applicability.

| **[Bearded Dragon Activity Recognition Pipeline: An AI-Based Approach to Behavioural Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17987v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of 1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392). Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments, significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, practical deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection, comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation. We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models. Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M, as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing datasets and methods predominantly focus on vehicle-mounted platforms, leaving other autonomous platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pi3DET, the first benchmark featuring LiDAR data and 3D bounding box annotations collected from multiple platforms: vehicle, quadruped, and drone, thereby facilitating research in 3D object detection for non-vehicle platforms as well as cross-platform 3D detection. Based on Pi3DET, we propose a novel cross-platform adaptation framework that transfers knowledge from the well-studied vehicle platform to other platforms. This framework achieves perspective-invariant 3D detection through robust alignment at both geometric and feature levels. Additionally, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the resilience and robustness of current 3D detectors in cross-platform scenarios, providing valuable insights for developing adaptive 3D perception systems. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging cross-platform tasks, demonstrating substantial gains over existing adaptation methods. We hope this work paves the way for generalizable and unified 3D perception systems across diverse and complex environments.

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion) |

Object detection serves as a cornerstone of autonomous systems, playing a vital role in enhancing driving safety, enabling autonomous functionality, improving traffic efficiency, and facilitating effective emergency responses. However, current technologies such as radar for environmental perception, cameras for road perception, and vehicle sensor networks face notable challenges, including high costs, vulnerability to weather and lighting conditions, and limited resolution.To address these limitations, this paper presents an improved autonomous target detection network based on YOLOv8. By integrating structural reparameterization technology, a bidirectional pyramid structure network model, and a novel detection pipeline into the YOLOv8 framework, the proposed approach achieves highly efficient and precise detection of multi-scale, small, and remote objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced model can effectively detect both large and small objects with a detection accuracy of 65%, showcasing significant advancements over traditional methods.This improved model holds substantial potential for real-world applications and is well-suited for autonomous driving competitions, such as the Formula Student Autonomous China (FSAC), particularly excelling in scenarios involving single-target and small-object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission included authors who did not consent to the submission.

| **[Constructing Ophthalmic MLLM for Positioning-diagnosis Collaboration Through Clinical Cognitive Chain Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17539v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert, an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen, achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks, surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%, significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$), demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert) |

To enable cross-modal interaction, we design the dynamic channel reduction within a convolutional block attention module (DCR-CBAM), which facilitates cross-talk between subnetworks by dynamically highlighting salient channel features. Furthermore, the dynamic multi-level aggregation block (DMLAB) is proposed to refine spatial feature representations through adaptive multiscale fusion. Finally, novel regularization losses that enforce channel saliency and spatial selectivity are introduced, leading to compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments using RGB-Depth (KITTI), a novel annotated RGB-Polarimetric dataset, and RGB-Infrared (M$^3$FD) benchmark dataset were conducted. We demonstrate consistent superiority of the proposed approach over the baseline RGB-only DiffusionDet. The modular architecture maintains the original decoding complexity, ensuring efficiency. These results establish the proposed RGBX-DiffusionDet as a flexible multimodal object detection approach, providing new insights into integrating diverse 2D sensing modalities into diffusion-based detection pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges such as object occlusion, variations in the physical properties of items, diversity in X-ray scanning devices, and limited training data hinder accurate and reliable detection of illicit items. Despite the large body of research in the field, reported experimental evaluations are often incomplete, with frequently conflicting outcomes. To shed light on the research landscape and facilitate further research, a systematic, detailed, and thorough comparative evaluation of recent Deep Learning (DL)-based methods for X-ray object detection is conducted. For this, a comprehensive evaluation framework is developed, composed of: a) Six recent, large-scale, and widely used public datasets for X-ray illicit item detection (OPIXray, CLCXray, SIXray, EDS, HiXray, and PIDray), b) Ten different state-of-the-art object detection schemes covering all main categories in the literature, including generic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), custom CNN, generic transformer, and hybrid CNN-transformer architectures, and c) Various detection (mAP50 and mAP50:95) and time/computational-complexity (inference time (ms), parameter size (M), and computational load (GFLOPS)) metrics. A thorough analysis of the results leads to critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a) Overall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection performance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and computational complexity analysis.

This work investigates this domain, revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers, fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space. To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that, pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, pretrained on the private Grounding20M dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[SFUOD: Source-Free Unknown Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17373v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data. While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects. To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[A Low-Cost Machine Learning Approach for Timber Diameter Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17219v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset (TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight, scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting, particularly in small and medium-sized operations.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we explore LEGO Co-builder, a hybrid benchmark combining real-world LEGO assembly logic with programmatically generated multimodal scenes. The dataset captures stepwise visual states and procedural instructions, allowing controlled evaluation of instruction-following, object detection, and state detection. We introduce a unified framework and assess leading VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen-VL, under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Our results reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, with a maximum F1 score of just 40.54\% on state detection, highlighting gaps in fine-grained visual understanding. We release the benchmark, codebase, and generation pipeline to support future research on multimodal assembly assistants grounded in real-world workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version has been anonymized for double-blind review</p></details> | None |

This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance. Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal, and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> | None |

Among these applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable advancements in object detection and representation using visual data, primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from a single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model, Decoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR, demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data, which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges. Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently, ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and state-of-the-art performance of our method.

Yet, many applications remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees, achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree. Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2 system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking pig detection and tracking under diverse and challenging conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16639v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space (object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models. However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use and further development.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A2Mamba: Attention-augmented State Space Models for Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16624v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing, have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while having 40% less parameters.

Addressing these background-related challenges is critical to improving model performance. We introduce PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline that integrates YOLOv10 for plant region detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for segmentation. YOLOv10 generates bounding box prompts to guide SAM2, enhancing segmentation accuracy. Both models were fine-tuned on herbarium images and evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient metrics. PlantSAM achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with an IoU of 0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97. Incorporating segmented images into classification models led to consistent performance improvements across five tested botanical traits, with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score improvements of 4.15%. Our findings highlight the importance of background removal in herbarium image analysis, as it significantly enhances classification accuracy by allowing models to focus more effectively on the foreground plant structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

To the best of our knowledge, is the first synthetic dataset specifically tailored for 2D and 3D object detection in the railway domain, the dataset is publicly available at https://syndra.retis.santannapisa.it. In the presented evaluation, a state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation method, originally developed for automotive perception, is adapted to the railway context, enabling the transferability of synthetic data to 3D object detection.

| **[eKalibr-Stereo: Continuous-Time Spatiotemporal Calibration for Event-Based Stereo Visual Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04451v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object detection. In ego-motion estimation, the stereo event camera setup is commonly adopted due to its direct scale perception and depth recovery. For optimal stereo visual fusion, accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. Considering that few stereo visual calibrators orienting to event cameras exist, based on our previous work eKalibr (an event camera intrinsic calibrator), we propose eKalibr-Stereo for accurate spatiotemporal calibration of event-based stereo visual systems. To improve the continuity of grid pattern tracking, building upon the grid pattern recognition method in eKalibr, an additional motion prior-based tracking module is designed in eKalibr-Stereo to track incomplete grid patterns. Based on tracked grid patterns, a two-step initialization procedure is performed to recover initial guesses of piece-wise B-splines and spatiotemporal parameters, followed by a continuous-time batch bundle adjustment to refine the initialized states to optimal ones. The results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Stereo can achieve accurate event-based stereo spatiotemporal calibration. The implementation of eKalibr-Stereo is open-sourced at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) |
| **[MAN++: Scaling Momentum Auxiliary Network for Supervised Local Learning in Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16279v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However, because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks, performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network, updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks. Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++ offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable alternative to conventional training methods.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

In this work, we propose a data-centric pipeline that systematically improves detection performance by focusing on the key question of identifying the blind spots of the model. Through detailed error analysis, we identify critical edge-cases such as confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented contexts. Then we directly address them through edge-case synthesis. We fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains, highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its weaknesses can be impactful in specialized domains like fisheye object detection.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, in CP, an ego agent needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-uniGuard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise, potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals, followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual encoding module, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and positional residuals. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories and difficulty levels.</p></details> |  | None |

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Low-Light Smartphone Dataset (LSD), a large-scale, high-resolution (4K+) dataset collected in the wild across a wide range of challenging lighting conditions (0.1 to 200 lux). LSD contains 6,425 precisely aligned low and normal-light image pairs, selected from over 8,000 dynamic indoor and outdoor scenes through multi-frame acquisition and expert evaluation. To evaluate generalization and aesthetic quality, we collect 2,117 unpaired low-light images from previously unseen devices. To fully exploit LSD, we propose TFFormer, a hybrid model that encodes luminance and chrominance (LC) separately to reduce color-structure entanglement. We further propose a cross-attention-driven joint decoder for context-aware fusion of LC representations, along with LC refinement and LC-guided supervision to significantly enhance perceptual fidelity and structural consistency.

Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects: i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii) channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

The quality of rice during cultivation is primarily determined by its cultivar and characteristics. Traditionally, rice classification and quality assessment rely on manual visual inspection, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. However, with advancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and quality evaluation based on its cultivar and characteristics has become increasingly feasible, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes a real-time evaluation mechanism for comprehensive rice grain assessment, integrating a one-stage object detection approach, a deep convolutional neural network, and traditional machine learning techniques. The proposed framework enables rice variety identification, grain completeness grading, and grain chalkiness evaluation. The rice grain dataset used in this study comprises approximately 20,000 images from six widely cultivated rice varieties in China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.14% in the object detection task and an accuracy of 97.89% in the classification task. Furthermore, the framework attains an average accuracy of 97.56% in grain completeness grading within the same rice variety, contributing to an effective quality evaluation system.</p></details> |  | None |

However, converting this irregular data into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup, reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous vision. Project page: eventbasedvision.github.io/eGSMV.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with 39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6 challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection to continuous spatial tracking.

| **[Beyond RGB: Adaptive Parallel Processing for RAW Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13163v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models are typically applied to standard RGB images processed through Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines, which are designed to enhance sensor-captured RAW images for human vision. However, these ISP functions can lead to a loss of critical information that may be essential in optimizing for computer vision tasks, such as object detection. In this work, we introduce Raw Adaptation Module (RAM), a module designed to replace the traditional ISP, with parameters optimized specifically for RAW object detection. Inspired by the parallel processing mechanisms of the human visual system, RAM departs from existing learned ISP methods by applying multiple ISP functions in parallel rather than sequentially, allowing for a more comprehensive capture of image features. These processed representations are then fused in a specialized module, which dynamically integrates and optimizes the information for the target task. This novel approach not only leverages the full potential of RAW sensor data but also enables task-specific pre-processing, resulting in superior object detection performance. Our approach outperforms RGB-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse RAW image datasets under varying lighting conditions and dynamic ranges.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Can Optical Denoising Clean Sonar Images? A Benchmark and Fusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01655v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in sonar images is crucial for underwater robotics applications including autonomous navigation and resource exploration. However, complex noise patterns inherent in sonar imagery, particularly speckle, reverberation, and non-Gaussian noise, significantly degrade detection accuracy. While denoising techniques have achieved remarkable success in optical imaging, their applicability to sonar data remains underexplored. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of nine state-of-the-art deep denoising models with distinct architectures, including Neighbor2Neighbor with varying noise parameters, Blind2Unblind with different noise configurations, and DSPNet, for sonar image preprocessing. We establish a rigorous benchmark using five publicly available sonar datasets and assess their impact on four representative detection algorithms: YOLOX, Faster R-CNN, SSD300, and SSDMobileNetV2. Our evaluation addresses three unresolved questions: first, how effectively optical denoising architectures transfer to sonar data; second, which model families perform best against sonar noise; and third, whether denoising truly improves detection accuracy in practical pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while denoising generally improves detection performance, effectiveness varies across methods due to their inherent biases toward specific noise types. To leverage complementary denoising effects, we propose a mutually-supervised multi-source denoising fusion framework where outputs from different denoisers mutually supervise each other at the pixel level, creating a synergistic framework that produces cleaner images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[InsightX Agent: An LMM-based Agentic Framework with Integrated Tools for Reliable X-ray NDT Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14899v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional detectors rely on deterministic bounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model robustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement framework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein distance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth distributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter high-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a simple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals. Experiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively integrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance. We further extend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the LISC and WBCDD datasets. These results confirm the scalability of our framework across both general and domain-specific detection tasks.

| **[ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10283v4)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring safety for physical agents remains an open challenge. For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> | None |

Addressing these issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its generality.

Effective solutions to this problem have significant implications in critical areas such as pest control, defect detection, and lesion segmentation in medical imaging. Prior research has predominantly emphasized supervised or unsupervised pre-training methods, leaving zero-shot approaches significantly underdeveloped. Existing zero-shot techniques commonly utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in automatic mode or rely on vision-language models to generate cues for segmentation; however, their performances remain unsatisfactory, due to the similarity of the camouflaged object and the background. This work studies how to avoid training by integrating large pre-trained models like SAM-2 and Owl-v2 with temporal information into a modular pipeline. Evaluated on the MoCA-Mask dataset, our approach achieves outstanding performance improvements, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot methods by raising the F-measure ($F_\beta^w$) from 0.296 to 0.628. Our approach also surpasses supervised methods, increasing the F-measure from 0.476 to 0.628. Additionally, evaluation on the MoCA-Filter dataset demonstrates an increase in the success rate from 0.628 to 0.697 when compared with FlowSAM, a supervised transfer method. A thorough ablation study further validates the individual contributions of each component. Besides our main contributions, we also highlight inconsistencies in previous work regarding metrics and settings.

Existing methods often rely on appearance features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node, with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing LiDAR Point Features with Foundation Model Priors for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13899v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details. To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

These patches were initially designed to deceive single-modal detectors (e.g., visible or infrared) and have recently been extended to target visible-infrared dual-modal detectors. However, existing dual-modal adversarial patch attacks have limited attack effectiveness across diverse physical scenarios. To address this, we propose CDUPatch, a universal cross-modal patch attack against visible-infrared object detectors across scales, views, and scenarios. Specifically, we observe that color variations lead to different levels of thermal absorption, resulting in temperature differences in infrared imaging. Leveraging this property, we propose an RGB-to-infrared adapter that maps RGB patches to infrared patches, enabling unified optimization of cross-modal patches. By learning an optimal color distribution on the adversarial patch, we can manipulate its thermal response and generate an adversarial infrared texture. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale clipping strategy and construct a new visible-infrared dataset, MSDrone, which contains aerial vehicle images in varying scales and perspectives. These data augmentation strategies enhance the robustness of our patch in real-world conditions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (e.g., DroneVehicle, LLVIP, VisDrone, MSDrone) show that our method outperforms existing patch attacks in the digital domain. Extensive physical tests further confirm strong transferability across scales, views, and scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> | None |

However, applications involving synthetic images, such as Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), remain limited. This restricts the development of autonomous computer vision-powered artificial intelligence (AI) agents for automatic application interaction. Enabling AI to effectively understand and interact with GUIs is crucial to advancing automation in software testing, accessibility, and human-computer interaction. In this work, we explore Instruction Visual Grounding (IVG), a multi-modal approach to object identification within a GUI. More precisely, given a natural language instruction and a GUI screen, IVG locates the coordinates of the element on the screen where the instruction should be executed. We propose two main methods: (1) IVGocr, which combines a Large Language Model (LLM), an object detection model, and an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module; and (2) IVGdirect, which uses a multimodal architecture for end-to-end grounding. For each method, we introduce a dedicated dataset. In addition, we propose the Central Point Validation (CPV) metric, a relaxed variant of the classical Central Proximity Score (CPS) metric.

Traditional methods in the field of intelligent driving perception rely on deep learning, which suffers from limited interpretability, often described as a "black box." This paper introduces a novel type of loss function, termed "Entropy Loss," along with an innovative training strategy. Entropy Loss is formulated based on the functionality of feature compression networks within the perception model. Drawing inspiration from communication systems, the information transmission process in a feature compression network is expected to demonstrate steady changes in information volume and a continuous decrease in information entropy. By modeling network layer outputs as continuous random variables, we construct a probabilistic model that quantifies changes in information volume. Entropy Loss is then derived based on these expectations, guiding the update of network parameters to enhance network interpretability. Our experiments indicate that the Entropy Loss training strategy accelerates the training process. Utilizing the same 60 training epochs, the accuracy of 3D object detection models using Entropy Loss on the KITTI test set improved by up to 4.47\% compared to models without Entropy Loss, underscoring the method's efficacy.

Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016 dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 15 figures, RA-L submission</p></details> | None |

However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering 158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability.

Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction. Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA) module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.</p></details> |  | None |

The absence of ground truths for unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB) is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions. To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to WACV 2025 (Tucson, Arizona, USA), February 28-March 4 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditionally, methods such as manual counting, loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 8 Figures.

The hardware consists of a four-microphone rectangular formation and a camera mounted on glasses with a wristband for displaying necessary information like direction. On a custom collected data set, JerryNet achieved a precision of 91. 1% for the sound direction, outperforming all the baseline models. The CLAP model achieved 98.5% and 95% accuracy on custom and AudioSet datasets, respectively.

Existing IoU-based losses often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance. However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution, often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU, we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

Human annotations suffer from imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning) framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally, we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale production datasets in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

These datasets need to offer diverse and challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures, including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and robust object detection architectures.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

However, deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work, we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium, Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50 across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant phenotyping scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Objects to Events: Unlocking Complex Visual Understanding in Object Detectors via LLM-guided Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05843v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current object detectors excel at entity localization and classification, yet exhibit inherent limitations in event recognition capabilities. This deficiency arises from their architecture's emphasis on discrete object identification rather than modeling the compositional reasoning, inter-object correlations, and contextual semantics essential for comprehensive event understanding. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework that expands the capability of standard object detectors beyond mere object recognition to complex event understanding through LLM-guided symbolic reasoning. Our key innovation lies in bridging the semantic gap between object detection and event understanding without requiring expensive task-specific training. The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%).

They have gained widespread attention in object detection due to their low power consumption and biological interpretability. However, existing SNN-based object detection methods suffer from local firing saturation, where neurons in information-concentrated regions fire continuously throughout all time steps. This abnormal neuron firing pattern reduces the feature discrimination capability and detection accuracy, while also increasing the firing rates that prevent SNNs from achieving their potential energy efficiency. To address this problem, we propose SpikeDet, a novel spiking object detector that optimizes firing patterns for accurate and energy-efficient detection. Specifically, we design a spiking backbone network, MDSNet, which effectively adjusts the membrane synaptic input distribution at each layer, achieving better neuron firing patterns during spiking feature extraction. Additionally, to better utilize and preserve these high-quality backbone features, we introduce the Spiking Multi-direction Fusion Module (SMFM), which realizes multi-direction fusion of spiking features, enhancing the multi-scale detection capability of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeDet achieves superior performance. On the COCO 2017 dataset, it achieves 51.4% AP, outperforming previous SNN-based methods by 2.5% AP while requiring only half the power consumption. On object detection sub-tasks, including the GEN1 event-based dataset and the URPC 2019 underwater dataset, SpikeDet also achieves the best performance. Notably, on GEN1, our method achieves 47.6% AP, outperforming previous SNN-based methods by 7.2% AP with better energy efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SS-DC: Spatial-Spectral Decoupling and Coupling Across Visible-Infrared Gap for Domain Adaptive Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12017v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID) module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids. Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on the FLIR-ADAS dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main-pages, 3 reference-pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

Research on artificial intelligence (AI) for EO detection in clearance operations has grown significantly in recent years. However, this research spans a wide range of fields, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of current trends and developments. Therefore, this article provides a literature review of academic research on AI for EO detection in clearance operations. It finds that research can be grouped into two main streams: AI for EO object detection and AI for EO risk prediction, with the latter being much less studied than the former. From the literature review, we develop three opportunities for future research. These include a call for renewed efforts in the use of AI for EO risk prediction, the combination of different AI systems and data sources, and novel approaches to improve EO risk prediction performance, such as pattern-based predictions. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future of AI for EO detection in clearance operations. We emphasize the role of traditional machine learning (ML) for this task, the need to dynamically incorporate expert knowledge into the models, and the importance of effectively integrating AI systems with real-world operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The research paper was accepted for publication in The Journal of Conventional Weapons Destruction</p></details> | None |

To overcome these challenges, we developed TomatoMAP, a comprehensive dataset for Solanum lycopersicum using an Internet of Things (IoT) based imaging system with standardized data acquisition protocols. Our dataset contains 64,464 RGB images that capture 12 different plant poses from four camera elevation angles. Each image includes manually annotated bounding boxes for seven regions of interest (ROIs), including leaves, panicle, batch of flowers, batch of fruits, axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616 high-resolution image subset with pixel-wise semantic and instance segmentation annotations for fine-grained phenotyping. We validated our dataset using a cascading model deep learning framework combining MobileNetv3 for classification, YOLOv11 for object detection, and MaskRCNN for segmentation. Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to the experts. Cohen's Kappa and inter-rater agreement heatmap confirm the reliability of automated fine-grained phenotyping using our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model. Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier removal techniques across multiple public datasets. Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene. Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions. Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance, achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5 of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods, our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency. Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

While Open-World and Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OWOD and OVOD) improve flexibility, OWOD lacks semantic labels for unknowns, and OVOD depends on user prompts, limiting autonomy. We propose an LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) framework that enables fully label-free, zero-shot detection by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate scene-specific object names. These are passed to an open-vocabulary detector for localization, allowing the system to adapt its goals dynamically. We introduce two new metrics, Class-Agnostic Average Precision (CAAP) and Semantic Naming Average Precision (SNAP), to separately evaluate localization and naming. Experiments on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD validate our approach, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel objects. Our method offers enhanced autonomy and adaptability for open-world understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances propose using large pre-trained models, such as Large Language Models and object detectors, to boost robotic perception in reinforcement learning. These models, trained on large datasets via self-supervised learning, can process text prompts and identify diverse objects in scenes, an invaluable skill in RL where learning object interaction is resource-intensive. This study demonstrates how to integrate such models into Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning to enable general and versatile robotic reach and grasp capabilities. We use a pre-trained object detection model to enable the agent to identify the object from a text prompt and generate a mask for goal conditioning. Mask-based goal conditioning provides object-agnostic cues, improving feature sharing and generalization. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated in a simulated reach-and-grasp task, where the mask-based goal conditioning consistently maintains a $\sim$90\% success rate in grasping both in and out-of-distribution objects, while also ensuring faster convergence to higher returns.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing ZSD works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers. In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds, which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera and 1432 species.

Our key insight, derived from wavelet analysis and empirical observations, is that IR images contain structurally rich high-frequency information critical for object detection, making an infrared-centric approach highly effective. To capitalize on this finding, we propose Infrared-Centric Fusion (IC-Fusion), a lightweight and modality-aware sensor fusion method that prioritizes infrared features while effectively integrating complementary RGB semantic context. IC-Fusion adopts a compact RGB backbone and designs a novel fusion module comprising a Multi-Scale Feature Distillation (MSFD) block to enhance RGB features and a three-stage fusion block with a Cross-Modal Channel Shuffle Gate (CCSG), a Cross-Modal Large Kernel Gate (CLKG), and a Channel Shuffle Projection (CSP) to facilitate effective cross-modal interaction. Experiments on the FLIR and LLVIP benchmarks demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our IR-centric fusion strategy, further validating its benefits.

Recently, many MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly target LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA methods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these techniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular distribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar setups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware PillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar level in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a single mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to each pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different classes, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large vehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse objects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This class-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new information, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance but also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street and K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will spark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, accepted to 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> | None |

While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistencies, manifesting as flickering effects that compromise visual experience and adversely affect decision-making. While recent approaches have incorporated historical data to mitigate the issue, they often incur high computational costs and may introduce noisy information that interferes with object detection. We propose OccLinker, a novel plugin framework designed to seamlessly integrate with existing VONs for boosting performance. Our method efficiently consolidates historical static and motion cues, learns sparse latent correlations with current features through a dual cross-attention mechanism, and produces correction occupancy components to refine the base network's predictions. We propose a new temporal consistency metric to quantitatively identify flickering effects. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior performance with negligible computational overhead, while effectively eliminating flickering artifacts.</p></details> |  | None |

However, recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce. Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors. Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an exceptionally low parameter count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Landmark Detection for Medical Images using a General-purpose Segmentation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11551v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics, with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables.

| **[MLoRQ: Bridging Low-Rank and Quantization for Transformer Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09616v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization (MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-level semantic understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations: Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI, and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter, facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving community.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Stereo-based 3D Anomaly Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: A New Dataset and Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09214v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving, with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road, 3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm, which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue. Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm and the dataset is verified in the experiments.

Current state-of-the-art detectors typically rely on either two-stage or one-stage approaches, often employing Anchor-based strategies, which can result in computationally expensive operations due to the redundant number of generated anchors during training. In contrast, Anchor-free mechanisms offer faster processing but suffer from a reduction in the number of training samples, potentially impacting detection accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose the Hybrid-Anchor Rotation Detector (HA-RDet), which combines the advantages of both anchor-based and anchor-free schemes for oriented object detection. By utilizing only one preset anchor for each location on the feature maps and refining these anchors with our Orientation-Aware Convolution technique, HA-RDet achieves competitive accuracies, including 75.41 mAP on DOTA-v1, 65.3 mAP on DIOR-R, and 90.2 mAP on HRSC2016, against current anchor-based state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bache...</summary><p>Bachelor thesis, Accepted to ICCV'25 SEA</p></details> | None |

We present FieldNet, a novel deep learning framework for real-time shadow removal, optimised for resource-constrained hardware. FieldNet introduces a probabilistic enhancement module and a novel loss function to address challenges of inconsistent shadow boundary supervision and artefact generation, achieving enhanced accuracy and simplicity without requiring shadow masks during inference. Trained on a dataset of 10,000 natural images augmented with synthetic shadows, FieldNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets (ISTD, ISTD+, SRD), with up to $9$x speed improvements (66 FPS on Nvidia 2080Ti) and superior shadow removal quality (PSNR: 38.67, SSIM: 0.991). Real-world case studies in precision agriculture robotics demonstrate the practical impact of FieldNet in enhancing weed detection accuracy. These advancements establish FieldNet as a robust, efficient solution for real-time vision tasks in field robotics and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables.

| **[On the Fragility of Multimodal Perception to Temporal Misalignment in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09095v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify, understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (2025)</p></details> | None |

However, current publicly available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios, low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40 minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping, high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking.

| **[Quantifying Context Bias in Domain Adaptation for Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14679v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD) has become essential to counter performance degradation caused by distribution shifts between training and deployment domains. However, a critical factor influencing DAOD - context bias resulting from learned foreground-background (FG-BG) associations - has remained underexplored. We address three key questions regarding FG BG associations in object detection: are FG-BG associations encoded during the training, is there a causal relationship between FG-BG associations and detection performance, and is there an effect of FG-BG association on DAOD. To examine how models capture FG BG associations, we analyze class-wise and feature-wise performance degradation using background masking and feature perturbation, measured via change in accuracies (defined as drop rate). To explore the causal role of FG-BG associations, we apply do-calculus on FG-BG pairs guided by class activation mapping (CAM). To quantify the causal influence of FG-BG associations across domains, we propose a novel metric - domain association gradient - defined as the ratio of drop rate to maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Through systematic experiments involving background masking, feature-level perturbations, and CAM, we reveal that convolution-based object detection models encode FG-BG associations. Our results demonstrate that context bias not only exists but causally undermines the generalization capabilities of object detection models across domains. Furthermore, we validate these findings across multiple models and datasets, including state-of-the-art architectures such as ALDI++. This study highlights the necessity of addressing context bias explicitly in DAOD frameworks, providing insights that pave the way for developing more robust and generalizable object detection systems.</p></details> | Under review | None |

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OnlineBEV: Recurrent Temporal Fusion in Bird's Eye View Representations for Multi-Camera 3D Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08644v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view (BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations. Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> | None |

Herein, we focus on three judgment tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density, assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition. These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection. Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0% (multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments. Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver assessments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often rely on depth estimators or transformer encoders to transform image features into BEV space, which reduces robustness or introduces significant computational overhead. Moreover, the insufficient geometric guidance in view transformation results in ray-directional misalignments, limiting the effectiveness of BEV representations. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient View Transformation (EVT), a novel 3D object detection framework that constructs a well-structured BEV representation, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Our approach focuses on two key aspects. First, Adaptive Sampling and Adaptive Projection (ASAP), which utilizes LiDAR guidance to generate 3D sampling points and adaptive kernels, enables more effective transformation of image features into BEV space and a refined BEV representation. Second, an improved query-based detection framework, incorporating group-wise mixed query selection and geometry-aware cross-attention, effectively captures both the common properties and the geometric structure of objects in the transformer decoder. On the nuScenes test set, EVT achieves state-of-the-art performance of 75.3% NDS with real-time inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities, especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and efficacy of our approach.

We uncover a previously undocumented attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures | None |

We reveal that conventional object localization methods suffer from gradient instability in small objects due to sharper loss curvature, leading to a convergence challenge. To address the issue, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Gradient Stabilization (UGS), a framework that reformulates object localization as a classification task to stabilize gradients. UGS quantizes continuous labels into interval non-uniform discrete representations. Under a classification-based objective, the localization branch generates bounded and confidence-driven gradients, mitigating instability. Furthermore, UGS integrates an uncertainty minimization (UM) loss that reduces prediction variance and an uncertainty-guided refinement (UR) module that identifies and refines high-uncertainty regions via perturbations. Evaluated on four benchmarks, UGS consistently improves anchor-based, anchor-free, and leading small object detectors. Especially, UGS enhances DINO-5scale by 2.6 AP on VisDrone, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods focus on detecting predefined object categories, limiting their applicability in real-world open scenarios. In this paper, we extend aerial object detection to open scenarios through image-text collaboration and propose RT-OVAD, the first real-time open-vocabulary detector for aerial scenes. Specifically, we first introduce an image-to-text alignment loss to replace the conventional category regression loss, thereby eliminating category constraints. Next, we propose a lightweight image-text collaboration strategy comprising an image-text collaboration encoder and a text-guided decoder. The encoder simultaneously enhances visual features and refines textual embeddings, while the decoder guides object queries to focus on class-relevant image features. This design further improves detection accuracy without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RT-OVAD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across open-vocabulary, zero-shot, and traditional closed-set detection tasks. For instance, on the open-vocabulary aerial detection benchmarks DIOR, DOTA-v2.0, and LAE-80C, RT-OVAD achieves 87.7 AP$_{50}$, 53.8 mAP, and 23.7 mAP, respectively, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (LAE-DINO) by 2.2, 7.0, and 3.5 points. In addition, RT-OVAD achieves an inference speed of 34 FPS on an RTX 4090 GPU, approximately three times faster than LAE-DINO (10 FPS), meeting the real-time detection requirements of diverse applications.

When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the target using simple geometric principles.

Collective perception, which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for cooperative vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

High-throughput approaches are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine learning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> | None |

However, the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the importance of replicating aerial viewing angles.

Traditional methods often struggle to integrate these components effectively, and this limits their capability to deal with complex, long-range navigation missions. In this paper, we propose LOVON, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for hierarchical task planning with open-vocabulary visual detection models, tailored for effective long-range object navigation in dynamic, unstructured environments. To tackle real-world challenges including visual jittering, blind zones, and temporary target loss, we design dedicated solutions such as Laplacian Variance Filtering for visual stabilization. We also develop a functional execution logic for the robot that guarantees LOVON's capabilities in autonomous navigation, task adaptation, and robust task completion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the successful completion of long-sequence tasks involving real-time detection, search, and navigation toward open-vocabulary dynamic targets. Furthermore, real-world experiments across different legged robots (Unitree Go2, B2, and H1-2) showcase the compatibility and appealing plug-and-play feature of LOVON.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures; Project Page: https://daojiepeng.github.io/LOVON/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://daojiepeng.github.io/LOVON) |

These factors create an information bottleneck where limited pixel representation cannot encode sufficient discriminative features. B2BDet addresses this with a two-stage framework that applies domain-specific super-resolution during inference, followed by detection using an enhanced YOLOv5 architecture. Unlike training-time super-resolution approaches that enhance learned representations, our method recovers visual information from each input image. The approach combines aerial-optimized SRGAN fine-tuning with architectural innovations including an Efficient Attention Module (EAM) and Cross-Layer Feature Pyramid Network (CLFPN). Evaluation across four aerial datasets shows performance gains, with VisDrone achieving 52.5% mAP using only 27.7M parameters. Ablation studies show that super-resolution preprocessing contributes +2.6% mAP improvement while architectural enhancements add +2.9%, yielding +5.5% total improvement over baseline YOLOv5. The method achieves computational efficiency with 53.8% parameter reduction compared to recent approaches while achieving strong small object detection performance.</p></details> |  | None |

A rate shift is needed to extract data from specimen images efficiently, moving beyond human-mediated transcription. We developed `Hespi' (HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline) using advanced computer vision techniques to extract pre-catalogue data from primary specimen labels on herbarium specimens. Hespi integrates two object detection models: one for detecting the components of the sheet and another for fields on the primary primary specimen label. It classifies labels as printed, typed, handwritten, or mixed and uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for extraction. The text is then corrected against authoritative taxon databases and refined using a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM). Hespi accurately detects and extracts text from specimen sheets across international herbaria, and its modular design allows users to train and integrate custom models.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures | None |

Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency, and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$ fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi 4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8 FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance, making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge computing.</p></details> |  | None |

We thoroughly explore the rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments. We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS datasets, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures, | None |

However, most existing methods face challenges in maintaining robustness under complex weather conditions, which limits their applicability. Meanwhile, the reliance on attention mechanisms in modality fusion introduces significant computational complexity and storage overhead, particularly when dealing with high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we propose the Cross-modality Fusion Mamba with Weather-removal (CFMW) to augment stability and cost-effectiveness under adverse weather conditions. Leveraging the proposed Perturbation-Adaptive Diffusion Model (PADM) and Cross-modality Fusion Mamba (CFM) modules, CFMW is able to reconstruct visual features affected by adverse weather, enriching the representation of image details. With efficient architecture design, CFMW is 3 times faster than Transformer-style fusion (e.g., CFT). To bridge the gap in relevant datasets, we construct a new Severe Weather Visible-Infrared (SWVI) dataset, encompassing diverse adverse weather scenarios such as rain, haze, and snow. The dataset contains 64,281 paired visible-infrared images, providing a valuable resource for future research. Extensive experiments on public datasets (i.e., M3FD and LLVIP) and the newly constructed SWVI dataset conclusively demonstrate that CFMW achieves state-of-the-art detection performance.

However, these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices, making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD, EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by 45% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy compared to accuracy-centric methods.</p></details> |  | None |

A critical challenge in GUI automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives, which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13% across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.</p></details> | ACL 2025; 17 pages | None |

However, existing LiDAR representation strategies often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning; and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving.

To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look, Explain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that utilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB image, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure detection - without additional information such as object detection or predefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The replanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a scene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides corrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly. LERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from both dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the newly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40% improvement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation tasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet simulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments, including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's effectiveness in replanning. We demonstrate that LERa is a robust and adaptable solution for error-aware task execution in robotics. The code is available at https://lera-robo.github.io.</p></details> | IROS 2025 | None |

Due to the sparse points and noisy measurements of the 4D radar, most of the research finish the 3D object detection task by integrating images from camera and perform modality fusion in BEV space. However, the potential of the radar and the fusion mechanism is still largely unexplored, hindering the performance improvement.

In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels. Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary.

Our motivation stems from the observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models (SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize high-resolution inputs. Meanwhile, our method maintains efficiency, achieving faster inference speed than most recent state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

Deep learning-based methods have been proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end framework leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector. Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Features are extracted in a pyramid manner during the mitigation stage and passed to the detector. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets corrupted by generated turbulence.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches for generating HPCs often involve fusion techniques with hyperspectral images and LiDAR point clouds, which inevitably lead to geometric-spectral distortions due to fusion errors and obstacle occlusions. These adverse effects limit their performance in downstream fine-grained tasks across multiple scenarios, particularly in airborne applications. To address these issues, we propose PiV-AHPC, a 3D object detection network for airborne HPCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at this HPCs task. Specifically, we first develop a pillar-voxel dual-branch encoder, where the former captures spectral and vertical structural features from HPCs to overcome spectral distortion, while the latter emphasizes extracting accurate 3D spatial features from point clouds. A multi-level feature fusion mechanism is devised to enhance information interaction between the two branches, achieving neighborhood feature alignment and channel-adaptive selection, thereby organically integrating heterogeneous features and mitigating geometric distortion. Extensive experiments on two airborne HPCs datasets demonstrate that PiV-AHPC possesses state-of-the-art detection performance and high generalization capability.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, advancements in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However, traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline promising future research directions and application prospects.

| **[Zero Memory Overhead Approach for Protecting Vision Transformer Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03816v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected, affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cooperative Students: Navigating Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Nighttime Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01988v4)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown significant advancements in object detection under well-lit conditions; however, its performance degrades notably in low-visibility scenarios, especially at night, posing challenges not only for its adaptability in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions but also for the reliability and efficiency of automated vehicles. To address this problem, we propose a \textbf{Co}operative \textbf{S}tudents (\textbf{CoS}) framework that innovatively employs global-local transformations (GLT) and a proxy-based target consistency (PTC) mechanism to capture the spatial consistency in day- and night-time scenarios effectively, and thus bridge the significant domain shift across contexts. Building upon this, we further devise an adaptive IoU-informed thresholding (AIT) module to gradually avoid overlooking potential true positives and enrich the latent information in the target domain. Comprehensive experiments show that CoS essentially enhanced UDA performance in low-visibility conditions and surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an increase in mAP of 3.0\%, 1.9\%, and 2.5\% on BDD100K, SHIFT, and ACDC datasets, respectively.

Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage, supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a 2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse lighting and weather conditions.

| **[Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification for Runtime Safety Assurance Using Causal Risk Analysis and Operational Design Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03515v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the runtime safety of autonomous systems remains challenging due to deep learning components' inherent uncertainty and their sensitivity to environmental changes. In this paper, we propose an enhancement of traditional uncertainty quantification by explicitly incorporating environmental conditions using risk-based causal analysis. We leverage Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) and fault tree modeling to identify critical operational conditions affecting system functionality. These conditions, together with uncertainties from the data and model, are integrated into a unified Bayesian Network (BN). At runtime, this BN is instantiated using real-time environmental observations to infer a probabilistic distribution over the safety estimation. This distribution enables the computation of both expected performance and its associated variance, providing a dynamic and context-aware measure of uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach through a case study of the Object Detection (OD) component in an Automated Valet Parking (AVP).</p></details> |  | None |

Underwater object detection methods based on noise reduction and image enhancement usually do not provide images preferred by the detector or require additional datasets. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play \textbf{U}nderwater joi\textbf{n}t \textbf{i}mage enhancemen\textbf{t} \textbf{Module} (UnitModule) that provides the input image preferred by the detector. We design an unsupervised learning loss for the joint training of UnitModule with the detector without additional datasets to improve the interaction between UnitModule and the detector. Furthermore, a color cast predictor with the assisting color cast loss and a data augmentation called Underwater Color Random Transfer (UCRT) are designed to improve the performance of UnitModule on underwater images with different color casts. Extensive experiments are conducted on DUO for different object detection models, where UnitModule achieves the highest performance improvement of 2.6 AP for YOLOv5-S and gains the improvement of 3.3 AP on the brand-new test set (\(\text{URPC}_{test}\)). And UnitModule significantly improves the performance of all object detection models we test, especially for models with a small number of parameters. In addition, UnitModule with a small number of parameters of 31K has little effect on the inference speed of the original object detection model. Our quantitative and visual analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of UnitModule in enhancing the input image and improving the perception ability of the detector for object features.

However, the high cost of dataset annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF) to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional semi-supervised algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, source code: https://github.com/VisionXLab/PWOOD</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/VisionXLab/PWOOD) |

Moreover, the tradeoff between model accuracy and computational complexity poses additional constraints on the application of RSOD algorithms. To address these issues, this study proposes an efficient and lightweight RSOD algorithm integrating multiscale receptive fields and foreground focus mechanism, named robust foreground weighted network(RFWNet). Specifically, we proposed a lightweight backbone network receptive field adaptive selection network (RFASNet), leveraging the rich context information of remote sensing images to enhance class separability. Additionally, we developed a foreground-background separation module(FBSM)consisting of a background redundant information filtering module (BRIFM) and a foreground information enhancement module (FIEM) to emphasize critical regions within images while filtering redundant background information. Finally, we designed a loss function, the weighted CIoU-Wasserstein loss (LWCW),which weights the IoU-based loss by using the normalized Wasserstein distance to mitigate model sensitivity to small object position deviations. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that RFWNet achieved 95.3% and 73.2% mean average precision (mAP) with 6.0 M parameters on the DOTA V1.0 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets, respectively, with an inference speed of 52 FPS.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lightweight Structure-Aware Attention for Visual Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16289v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention operator has been widely used as a basic brick in visual understanding since it provides some flexibility through its adjustable kernels. However, this operator suffers from inherent limitations: (1) the attention kernel is not discriminative enough, resulting in high redundancy, and (2) the complexity in computation and memory is quadratic in the sequence length. In this paper, we propose a novel attention operator, called Lightweight Structure-aware Attention (LiSA), which has a better representation power with log-linear complexity. Our operator transforms the attention kernels to be more discriminative by learning structural patterns. These structural patterns are encoded by exploiting a set of relative position embeddings (RPEs) as multiplicative weights, thereby improving the representation power of the attention kernels. Additionally, the RPEs are approximated to obtain log-linear complexity. Our experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed operator outperforms self-attention and other existing operators, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K and other downstream tasks such as video action recognition on Kinetics-400, object detection \& instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE-20K.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures | None |

A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence, the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and mAP@50-95 metrics.

| **[Weakly-supervised Contrastive Learning with Quantity Prompts for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02454v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection, non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully-supervised ones.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Late Collaborative Perception Framework for 3D Multi-Object and Multi-Source Association and Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02430v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy, they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position, and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges, setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.</p></details> |  | None |

Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability, making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures | None |

To this end, the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) focuses on the research and development of several robotic applications empowered with software, including laptop refurbishing. Cleaning represents a major step in refurbishing and involves identifying and removing stickers from laptop surfaces. Software plays a crucial role in the cleaning process. For instance, the software integrates various object detection models to identify and remove stickers from laptops automatically. However, given the diversity in types of stickers (e.g., shapes, colors, locations), identification of the stickers is highly uncertain, thereby requiring explicit quantification of uncertainty associated with the identified stickers. Such uncertainty quantification can help reduce risks in removing stickers, which, for example, could otherwise result in software faults damaging laptop surfaces. For uncertainty quantification, we adopted the Monte Carlo Dropout method to evaluate six sticker detection models (SDMs) from DTI using three datasets: the original image dataset from DTI and two datasets generated with vision language models, i.e., DALL-E-3 and Stable Diffusion-3. In addition, we presented novel robustness metrics concerning detection accuracy and uncertainty to assess the robustness of the SDMs based on adversarial datasets generated from the three datasets using a dense adversary method. Our evaluation results show that different SDMs perform differently regarding different metrics. Based on the results, we provide SDM selection guidelines and lessons learned from various perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Experiments on diverse images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement.

An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of performance on a bifurcation detection task.</p></details> |  | None |

While cameras and LiDAR sensors each offer unique advantages--cameras provide rich texture information and LiDAR offers precise 3D spatial data--relying on a single modality often leads to performance limitations. This paper introduces MV2DFusion, a multi-modal detection framework that integrates the strengths of both worlds through an advanced query-based fusion mechanism. By introducing an image query generator to align with image-specific attributes and a point cloud query generator, MV2DFusion effectively combines modality-specific object semantics without biasing toward one single modality. Then the sparse fusion process can be accomplished based on the valuable object semantics, ensuring efficient and accurate object detection across various scenarios. Our framework's flexibility allows it to integrate with any image and point cloud-based detectors, showcasing its adaptability and potential for future advancements. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that MV2DFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in long-range detection scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation, confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully exploit or integrate.</p></details> |  | None |

Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood. We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution, synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using real data alone.</p></details> |  | None |

The integration of deep learning models has facilitated the development of precise and automated segmentation methods. Although prior research has explored teeth segmentation, not many methods have successfully performed tooth segmentation and detection simultaneously. This study presents UFBA-425, a dental dataset derived from the UFBA-UESC dataset, featuring bounding box and polygon annotations for 425 panoramic dental X-rays. In addition, this paper presents the OralBBNet architecture, which is based on the best segmentation and detection qualities of architectures such as U-Net and YOLOv8, respectively. OralBBNet is designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of tooth classification and segmentation on panoramic X-rays by leveraging the complementary strengths of U-Net and YOLOv8. Our approach achieved a 1-3% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) for tooth detection compared to existing techniques and a 15-20% improvement in the dice score for teeth segmentation over state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions for various tooth categories and 2-4% improvement in the dice score compared to other SOTA segmentation architectures.

Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones is Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at $224 \times 224$px, while the "high-resolution" versions are around $378-448$px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-resolution vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model training using RADIO as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> | None |

Existing methods only consider fixed frames of input data for a single detector, such as monocular RGB-D images or point clouds reconstructed from dense multi-view RGB-D images. While in practical application scenes such as robot navigation and manipulation, the raw input to the 3D detectors is the RGB-D images with variable frame numbers instead of the reconstructed scene point cloud. However, the previous approaches can only handle fixed frame input data and have poor performance with variable frame input. In order to facilitate 3D object detection methods suitable for practical tasks, we present a novel 3D detection framework named AnyView for our practical applications, which generalizes well across different numbers of input frames with a single model. To be specific, we propose a geometric learner to mine the local geometric features of each input RGB-D image frame and implement local-global feature interaction through a designed spatial mixture module. Meanwhile, we further utilize a dynamic token strategy to adaptively adjust the number of extracted features for each frame, which ensures consistent global feature density and further enhances the generalization after fusion. Extensive experiments on the ScanNet dataset show our method achieves both great generalizability and high detection accuracy with a simple and clean architecture containing a similar amount of parameters with the baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

By applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction, validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic Equitable Clustering: A Simple and Effective Strategy for Clustering Vision Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13337v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained prominence for its superior relational modeling prowess. However, its global attention mechanism's quadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy spatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in tokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups, thus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling inter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and balanced clustering method, named Semantic Equitable Clustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic relevance in an efficient, straightforward manner. In contrast to traditional clustering methods requiring multiple iterations, our method achieves token clustering in a single pass. Additionally, SEC regulates the number of tokens per cluster, ensuring a balanced distribution for effective parallel processing on current computational platforms without necessitating further optimization. Capitalizing on SEC, we propose a versatile vision backbone, SECViT. Comprehensive experiments in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of SECViT. Moreover, SEC can be conveniently and swiftly applied to multimodal large language models (MLLM), such as LLaVA, to serve as a vision language connector, effectively accelerating the model's efficiency while maintaining unchanged or better performance.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | None |

While recent advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs. Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently, PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference. Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior accuracy.

This paper presents a computer vision system that enables industrial robots to detect and grasp pen components in arbitrary orientations without requiring structured trays, while maintaining robust performance under varying lighting conditions.

Our system achieves 95% detection accuracy across diverse lighting conditions while eliminating the need for structured component placement, demonstrating a 30% reduction in setup time and significant improvement in manufacturing flexibility. The approach is validated through extensive testing under four distinct lighting scenarios, showing practical applicability for real-world industrial deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

These challenges highlight the necessity for a robust and efficient multimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable potential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a multimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To improve geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block (DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from deformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions, which serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal feature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared (IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba Block for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature fusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for small objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale feature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba (DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to the SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In particular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and cross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more discriminative features. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset show that our method outperforms the baseline OAFA method by 3.6% in the mAP metric.

Current algorithms often depend on hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics, resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone. HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection. Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1\% AP$_{50}$ and 3.8\% AP increase over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter count by 4M.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, to appear in KBS</p></details> | None |

However, the inherent noise in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g., 30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation. Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts. Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted in IROS25, Hangzhou, China</p></details> | None |
| **[UPRE: Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation for Object Detection via Unified Prompt and Representation Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00721v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) presents substantial challenges due to the lack of images in the target domain. Previous approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tackle this challenge, exploiting their zero-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods primarily address domain distribution shifts and overlook the misalignment between the detection task and VLMs, which rely on manually crafted prompts. To overcome these limitations, we propose the unified prompt and representation enhancement (UPRE) framework, which jointly optimizes both textual prompts and visual representations. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-view domain prompt that combines linguistic domain priors with detection-specific knowledge, and a visual representation enhancement module that produces domain style variations. Furthermore, we introduce multi-level enhancement strategies, including relative domain distance and positive-negative separation, which align multi-modal representations at the image level and capture diverse visual representations at the instance level, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in ZSDA detection scenarios.

| **[Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/qhfan/MALA) |

Therefore, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for object detection has recently gained increasing research attention. UDA for object detection has been dominated by domain alignment methods, which achieve top performance. Recently, self-labeling methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the limitations that prevent self-labeling detectors from achieving commensurate performance with domain alignment methods. Specifically, we identify the high proportion of simple samples during training, i.e., the simple-label bias, as the central cause. We propose a novel approach called De-Simplifying Pseudo Labels (DeSimPL) to mitigate the issue. DeSimPL utilizes an instance-level memory bank to implement an innovative pseudo label updating strategy. Then, adversarial samples are introduced during training to enhance the proportion. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive weighted loss to avoid the model suffering from an abundance of false positive pseudo labels in the late training period. Experimental results demonstrate that DeSimPL effectively reduces the proportion of simple samples during training, leading to a significant performance improvement for self-labeling detectors. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks validate our analysis and conclusions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems. 15 pages, 10 figures</p></details> | None |

Until now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video. MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking, and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth amodal content.

However, most existing UAV-OD algorithms rely on manually designed components, which require extensive tuning. End-to-end models that do not depend on such manually designed components are mainly designed for natural images, which are less effective for UAV imagery. To address such challenges, this paper proposes an efficient detection transformer (DETR) framework tailored for UAV imagery, i.e., UAV-DETR. The framework includes a multi-scale feature fusion with frequency enhancement module, which captures both spatial and frequency information at different scales. In addition, a frequency-focused down-sampling module is presented to retain critical spatial details during down-sampling. A semantic alignment and calibration module is developed to align and fuse features from different fusion paths. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach across various UAV imagery datasets. On the VisDrone dataset, our method improves AP by 3.1\% and $\text{AP}_{50}$ by 4.2\% over the baseline. Similar enhancements are observed on the UAVVaste dataset.

However, during collaborative tasks, existing systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale. This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods' object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results, and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIED 2025 Late Breaking Results Track</p></details> | None |

While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate performance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically fail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at 100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms. A quantitative assessment of the trade-offs between different hardware devices and accelerators remains unexplored, despite being critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, they overlook the impact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading to safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In this paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP) as new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time and physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for real-time 3D object detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics for the entire autonomous driving system using nuPlan dataset, and evaluate 3D object detection models accounting for hardware differences and accelerators. We also develop a state-of-the-art performance model for real-time 3D object detection through latency-aware hyperparameter optimization (L-HPO) using our metrics. Additionally, we quantitatively demonstrate that the assumption "the more point clouds, the better the recognition performance" is incorrect for real-time applications and optimize both hardware and model selection using our metrics.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures | None |

Recent pillar-based 3D object detectors have gained significant attention due to their compact representation and low computational overhead, making them suitable for onboard deployment and quantization. However, existing pillar-based detectors still suffer from information loss along height dimension and large numerical distribution difference during pillar feature encoding (PFE), which severely limits their performance and quantization potential. To address above issue, we first unveil the importance of different input information during PFE and identify the height dimension as a key factor in enhancing 3D detection performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a height-aware pillar feature encoder, called PillarHist. Specifically, PillarHist statistics the discrete distribution of points at different heights within one pillar with the information entropy guidance. This simple yet effective design greatly preserves the information along the height dimension while significantly reducing the computation overhead of the PFE. Meanwhile, PillarHist also constrains the arithmetic distribution of PFE input to a stable range, making it quantization-friendly. Notably, PillarHist operates exclusively within the PFE stage to enhance performance, enabling seamless integration into existing pillar-based methods without introducing complex operations. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PillarHist in terms of both efficiency and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need further revision</p></details> | None |

Filtering techniques based on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection are commonly added as an extra safeguard to filter hallucinations caused by overconfidence in novel objects. Nevertheless, evaluating YOLO-family detectors and their filters under existing OoD benchmarks often leads to unsatisfactory performance. This paper studies the underlying reasons for performance bottlenecks and proposes a methodology to improve performance fundamentally. Our first contribution is a calibration of all existing evaluation results: Although images in existing OoD benchmark datasets are claimed not to have objects within in-distribution (ID) classes (i.e., categories defined in the training dataset), around 13% of objects detected by the object detector are actually ID objects. Dually, the ID dataset containing OoD objects can also negatively impact the decision boundary of filters. These ultimately lead to a significantly imprecise performance estimation. Our second contribution is to consider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors and filters. By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset that semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted OoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness score, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a combined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving benchmark BDD-100K.

To this end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters, e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images, fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile, visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the generalization ability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats. Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the $l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs, PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional frame-based cameras struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV), the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes 147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion continuity to guide the network in retaining target events.

| **[OcRFDet: Object-Centric Radiance Fields for Multi-View 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23565v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance. Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation. However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields (OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention (HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark.

The key contributions of this work are twofold: (1) identifying and quantifying the performance gap in object detection models under challenging weather conditions, and (2) demonstrating how tailored data augmentation strategies can significantly enhance the robustness of these models. This research establishes a solid foundation for improving the reliability of perception systems in demanding environmental scenarios, and provides a pathway for future advancements in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[From Sight to Insight: Unleashing Eye-Tracking in Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23519v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 15 Pages, 9 Figures | None |

Current methods balance accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of physics-informed augmentation techniques with the YOLOv12 architecture, this study advances underwater detection. With Residual ELAN blocks to preserve structural features in turbid waters and Area Attention to maintain large receptive fields for occluded objects while reducing computational complexity. Underwater optical properties are addressed by domain-specific augmentations such as turbulence adaptive blurring, biologically grounded occlusion simulation, and spectral HSV transformations for color distortion. Extensive tests on four difficult datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by up to 7.94% compared to previous models. The crucial role of augmentation strategy is validated by ablation studies. This work offers a precise and effective solution for conservation and underwater robotics applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multimodal Object Detection using Depth and Image Data for Manufacturing Parts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09062v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manufacturing requires reliable object detection methods for precise picking and handling of diverse types of manufacturing parts and components. Traditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras or 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors have weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D sensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can undermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems. To address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining an red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are calibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two hardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to process both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster R-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The results show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only and RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More specifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean Precision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the depth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%. Hence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in service to smart manufacturing applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Detecting What Matters: A Novel Approach for Out-of-Distribution 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23426v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless' based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components: layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches are typically limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues, distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii) Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement. Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language.

However, existing methods struggle with low-light conditions due to issues like indistinct small-object features, limited feature interaction, and poor image quality, which degrade detection accuracy and speed. To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. YOLO-LLTS introduces three main contributions: the High-Resolution Feature Map for Small Object Detection (HRFM-SOD) module to enhance small-object detection by mitigating feature dilution; the Multi-branch Feature Interaction Attention (MFIA) module to improve information extraction through multi-scale features interaction; and the Prior-Guided Feature Enhancement Module (PGFE) to enhance image quality by addressing noise, low contrast, and blurriness. Additionally, we construct a novel dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios. Experiments show that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, 7.5% mAP50 and 9.8% mAP50:95 on GTSDB-night, and superior results on CCTSDB2021.

Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed, leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV object detection tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, the computational demands of these models, particularly with large image sizes and multiple transformer layers, pose significant challenges for efficient running on edge devices. Existing pruning and distillation methods either need retraining or are designed for ViT models, which are hard to migrate to 3D detectors. To address this issue, we propose a zero-shot runtime pruning method for transformer decoders in 3D object detection models. The method, termed tgGBC (trim keys gradually Guided By Classification scores), systematically trims keys in transformer modules based on their importance. We expand the classification score to multiply it with the attention map to get the importance score of each key and then prune certain keys after each transformer layer according to their importance scores. Our method achieves a 1.99x speedup in the transformer decoder of the latest ToC3D model, with only a minimal performance loss of less than 1%. Interestingly, for certain models, our method even enhances their performance. Moreover, we deploy 3D detectors with tgGBC on an edge device, further validating the effectiveness of our method.

However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05, 89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices. The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages , 4 figures.

However, in CP, an ego agent needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP), which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally, pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing surveys typically focus on isolated aspects of TSS, a comprehensive analytical framework bridging low-level and high-level perception tasks, particularly considering emerging technologies, remains lacking. This paper presents a systematic review of vision technologies in TSS, examining both low-level perception tasks (object detection, classification, and tracking) and high-level perception tasks (parameter estimation, anomaly detection, and behavior understanding). Specifically, we first provide a detailed methodological categorization and comprehensive performance evaluation for each task. Our investigation reveals five fundamental limitations in current TSS: perceptual data degradation in complex scenarios, data-driven learning constraints, semantic understanding gaps, sensing coverage limitations and computational resource demands. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze five categories of current approaches and potential trends: advanced perception enhancement, efficient learning paradigms, knowledge-enhanced understanding, cooperative sensing frameworks and efficient computing frameworks, critically assessing their real-world applicability. Furthermore, we evaluate the transformative potential of foundation models in TSS, which exhibit remarkable zero-shot learning abilities, strong generalization, and sophisticated reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks. This review provides a unified analytical framework bridging low-level and high-level perception tasks, systematically analyzes current limitations and solutions, and presents a structured roadmap for integrating emerging technologies, particularly foundation models, to enhance TSS capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However, generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods, supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images. TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through visual-language alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Note:...</summary><p>Note: This is a preprint version of a paper submitted to AIIDE 2025.

Starting with foreground segmentation tasks, specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection (SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision, Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving Token-based Object Detection with Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22562v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for publication in IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

This study evaluates defense mechanisms for the YOLOv5 model against such attacks. Optimized adversarial patches were generated and placed in sensitive image regions, by applying EigenCAM and grid search to determine optimal placement. We tested several defenses, including Segment and Complete (SAC), Inpainting, and Latent Diffusion Models. Our pipeline comprises three main stages: patch application, object detection, and defense analysis. Results indicate that adversarial patches reduce average detection confidence by 22.06\%. Defenses restored confidence levels by 3.45\% (SAC), 5.05\% (Inpainting), and significantly improved them by 26.61\%, which even exceeds the original accuracy levels, when using the Latent Diffusion Model, highlighting its superior effectiveness in mitigating the effects of adversarial patches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Attention-disentangled Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space Optimization for Few-shot Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22161v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based on entangled feature spaces.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[CERBERUS: Crack Evaluation & Recognition Benchmark for Engineering Reliability & Urban Stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21909v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CERBERUS is a synthetic benchmark designed to help train and evaluate AI models for detecting cracks and other defects in infrastructure. It includes a crack image generator and realistic 3D inspection scenarios built in Unity. The benchmark features two types of setups: a simple Fly-By wall inspection and a more complex Underpass scene with lighting and geometry challenges. We tested a popular object detection model (YOLO) using different combinations of synthetic and real crack data. Results show that combining synthetic and real data improves performance on real-world images. CERBERUS provides a flexible, repeatable way to test defect detection systems and supports future research in automated infrastructure inspection. CERBERUS is publicly available at https://github.com/justinreinman/Cerberus-Defect-Generator.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/justinreinman/Cerberus-Defect-Generator) |
| **[Visual Content Detection in Educational Videos with Transfer Learning and Dataset Enrichment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21903v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation, searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension, retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs, tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy. Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of a paper accepted to MIPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Embodied Domain Adaptation for Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21860v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots rely on object detectors for perception and object localization in indoor environments. However, standard closed-set methods struggle to handle the diverse objects and dynamic conditions encountered in real homes and labs. Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), driven by Vision Language Models (VLMs), extends beyond fixed labels but still struggles with domain shifts in indoor environments. We introduce a Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) approach that adapts a pre-trained model without accessing source data. We refine pseudo labels via temporal clustering, employ multi-scale threshold fusion, and apply a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning. Our Embodied Domain Adaptation for Object Detection (EDAOD) benchmark evaluates adaptation under sequential changes in lighting, layout, and object diversity. Our experiments show significant gains in zero-shot detection performance and flexible adaptation to dynamic indoor conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |
