| **[Self-Supervised Sparse Sensor Fusion for Long Range Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13995v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100 km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks, which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of 30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods, reaching distances up to 250 meters.

| **[RICO: Two Realistic Benchmarks and an In-Depth Analysis for Incremental Learning in Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13878v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV Workshops 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment: Enabling Accurate Perception for Intelligent Transportation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13823v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain. Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Domai...</summary><p>Domain adaptation, Virtual Reality, Object Detection</p></details> | None |
| **[SBP-YOLO:A Lightweight Real-Time Model for Detecting Speed Bumps and Potholes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01339v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable and real-time detection of road speed bumps and potholes is crucial for anticipatory perception in advanced suspension systems, enabling timely and adaptive damping control. Achieving high accuracy and efficiency on embedded platforms remains challenging due to limited computational resources and the small scale of distant targets. This paper presents SBP-YOLO, a lightweight and high-speed detection framework tailored for bump and pothole recognition. Based on YOLOv11n, the model integrates GhostConv and VoVGSCSPC modules into the backbone and neck to reduce computation while enhancing multi-scale semantic features. To improve small-object detection, a P2-level branch is introduced with a lightweight and efficient detection head LEDH mitigating the added computational overhead without compromising accuracy. A hybrid training strategy combining NWD loss, backbone-level knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-driven augmentation further enhances localization precision and robustness. Experiments show that SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0 percent mAP, outperforming the YOLOv11n baseline by 5.8 percent. After TensorRT FP16 quantization, it runs at 139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier, delivering a 12.4 percent speedup over the P2-enhanced YOLOv11. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for fast and low-latency road condition perception in embedded suspension control systems.</p></details> | 14pages,10figures | None |
| **[ContrastAlign: Toward Robust BEV Feature Alignment via Contrastive Learning for Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16873v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of 3D object detection tasks, fusing heterogeneous features from LiDAR and camera sensors into a unified Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation is a widely adopted paradigm. However, existing methods often suffer from imprecise sensor calibration, leading to feature misalignment in LiDAR-camera BEV fusion. Moreover, such inaccuracies cause errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, aggravating misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a novel ContrastAlign approach that utilizes contrastive learning to enhance the alignment of heterogeneous modalities, thereby improving the robustness of the fusion process. Specifically, our approach comprises three key components: (1) the L-Instance module, which extracts LiDAR instance features within the LiDAR BEV features; (2) the C-Instance module, which predicts camera instance features through Region of Interest (RoI) pooling on the camera BEV features; (3) the InstanceFusion module, which employs contrastive learning to generate consistent instance features across heFterogeneous modalities. Subsequently, we use graph matching to calculate the similarity between the neighboring camera instance features and the similarity instance features to complete the alignment of instance features. Our method achieves SOTA performance, with an mAP of 71.5%, surpassing GraphBEV by 1.4% on the nuScenes val set. Importantly, our method excels BEVFusion under conditions with spatial & temporal misalignment noise, improving mAP by 1.4% and 11.1% on nuScenes dataset. Notably, on the Argoverse2 dataset, ContrastAlign outperforms GraphBEV by 1.0% in mAP, indicating that the farther the distance, the more severe the feature misalignment and the more effective.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Stereo-based 3D Anomaly Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: A New Dataset and Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09214v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving, with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road, 3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm, which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue. Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm and the dataset is verified in the experiments.

| **[CORENet: Cross-Modal 4D Radar Denoising Network with LiDAR Supervision for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13485v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data. Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to existing mainstream approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[CMF-IoU: Multi-Stage Cross-Modal Fusion 3D Object Detection with IoU Joint Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12917v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal methods based on camera and LiDAR sensors have garnered significant attention in the field of 3D detection. However, many prevalent works focus on single or partial stage fusion, leading to insufficient feature extraction and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a multi-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to effectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic information. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space via a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the representation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral cross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and pseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR points. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to mitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D convolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point aware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from LiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal refinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an intersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel proposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with both high IoU and classification scores. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of our method on the KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The P...</summary><p>The Paper is Accepted by TCSVT</p></details> | None |
| **[Co-Paced Learning Strategy Based on Confidence for Flying Bird Object Detection Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12071v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The flying bird objects captured by surveillance cameras exhibit varying levels of recognition difficulty due to factors such as their varying sizes or degrees of similarity to the background. To alleviate the negative impact of hard samples on training the Flying Bird Object Detection (FBOD) model for surveillance videos, we propose the Co-Paced Learning strategy Based on Confidence (CPL-BC) and apply it to the training process of the FBOD model. This strategy involves maintaining two models with identical structures but different initial parameter configurations that collaborate with each other to select easy samples for training, where the prediction confidence exceeds a set threshold. As training progresses, the strategy gradually lowers the threshold, thereby gradually enhancing the model's ability to recognize objects, from easier to more hard ones. Prior to applying CPL-BC, we pre-trained the two FBOD models to equip them with the capability to assess the difficulty of flying bird object samples. Experimental results on two different datasets of flying bird objects in surveillance videos demonstrate that, compared to other model learning strategies, CPL-BC significantly improves detection accuracy, thereby verifying the method's effectiveness and advancement.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neural Rendering for Sensor Adaptation in 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12695v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles often have varying camera sensor setups, which is inevitable due to restricted placement options for different vehicle types. Training a perception model on one particular setup and evaluating it on a new, different sensor setup reveals the so-called cross-sensor domain gap, typically leading to a degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this end, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA to specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant cross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model architecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the one hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most robust against varying sensor configurations. On the other hand, we propose a novel data-driven sensor adaptation pipeline based on neural rendering, which can transform entire datasets to match different camera sensor setups. Applying this approach improves performance across all investigated 3D object detectors, mitigating the cross-sensor domain gap by a large margin and reducing the need for new data collection by enabling efficient data reusability across vehicles with different sensor setups. The CamShift dataset and the sensor adaptation benchmark are available at https://dmholtz.github.io/camshift/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://dmholtz.github.io/camshift) |
| **[Refine-and-Contrast: Adaptive Instance-Aware BEV Representations for Multi-UAV Collaborative Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12684v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-UAV collaborative 3D detection enables accurate and robust perception by fusing multi-view observations from aerial platforms, offering significant advantages in coverage and occlusion handling, while posing new challenges for computation on resource-constrained UAV platforms. In this paper, we present AdaBEV, a novel framework that learns adaptive instance-aware BEV representations through a refine-and-contrast paradigm. Unlike existing methods that treat all BEV grids equally, AdaBEV introduces a Box-Guided Refinement Module (BG-RM) and an Instance-Background Contrastive Learning (IBCL) to enhance semantic awareness and feature discriminability. BG-RM refines only BEV grids associated with foreground instances using 2D supervision and spatial subdivision, while IBCL promotes stronger separation between foreground and background features via contrastive learning in BEV space. Extensive experiments on the Air-Co-Pred dataset demonstrate that AdaBEV achieves superior accuracy-computation trade-offs across model scales, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at low resolutions and approaching upper bound performance while maintaining low-resolution BEV inputs and negligible overhead.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |
| **[InsightX Agent: An LMM-based Agentic Framework with Integrated Tools for Reliable X-ray NDT Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14899v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

This study investigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a state-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated detection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\% IoU (mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's 0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized at a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a substantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the RT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more practical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its superior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy. This research provides valuable insights into the application of advanced Transformer-based detectors for environmental conservation, highlighting the critical trade-offs between model complexity and operational viability.</p></details> |  | None |

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), repetitive motor behaviors such as spinning, head banging, and arm flapping are key indicators for diagnosis. This study focuses on distinguishing between children with ASD and typically developed (TD) peers by analyzing videos captured in natural, uncontrolled environments. Using the publicly available Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD), we address the classification task as a binary problem, ASD vs. TD, based on stereotypical repetitive gestures. We adopt a pipeline integrating YOLOv7-based detection, extensive video augmentations, and the VideoMAE framework, which efficiently captures both spatial and temporal features through a high-ratio masking and reconstruction strategy. Our proposed approach achieves 95% accuracy, 0.93 precision, 0.94 recall, and 0.94 F1 score, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by a significant margin. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining advanced object detection, robust data augmentation, and masked autoencoder-based video modeling for reliable ASD vs. TD classification in naturalistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chang...</summary><p>Change Note for Version 3 - Extended Study (ASD vs TD Classification) This version extends v2 from 3-class gesture recognition to binary ASD vs TD detection, using expanded SSBD variants, a new TD class, improved preprocessing, and updated metrics (95% acc, 0.93 prec, 0.94 rec, 0.94 F1).

| **[RISE: Enhancing VLM Image Annotation with Self-Supervised Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13229v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing S4 studies often rely on small-scale datasets and models, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we propose S5, the first scalable framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in RS, which unlocks the potential of vast unlabeled Earth observation data typically underutilized due to costly pixel-level annotations. Built upon existing large-scale RS datasets, S5 introduces a data selection strategy that integrates entropy-based filtering and diversity expansion, resulting in the RS4P-1M dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically scales S4 methods by pre-training RS foundation models (RSFMs) of varying sizes on this extensive corpus, significantly boosting their performance on land cover segmentation and object detection tasks. Furthermore, during fine-tuning, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based multi-dataset fine-tuning approach, which enables efficient adaptation to multiple RS benchmarks with fewer parameters. This approach improves the generalization and versatility of RSFMs across diverse RS benchmarks. The resulting RSFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, underscoring the viability of scaling semi-supervised learning for RS applications.

To address this, we propose AquaFeat, a novel, plug-and-play module that performs task-driven feature enhancement. Our approach integrates a multi-scale feature enhancement network trained end-to-end with the detector's loss function, ensuring the enhancement process is explicitly guided to refine features most relevant to the detection task. When integrated with YOLOv8m on challenging underwater datasets, AquaFeat achieves state-of-the-art Precision (0.877) and Recall (0.624), along with competitive mAP scores (mAP@0.5 of 0.677 and mAP@[0.5:0.95] of 0.421). By delivering these accuracy gains while maintaining a practical processing speed of 46.5 FPS, our model provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for real-world applications, such as marine ecosystem monitoring and infrastructure inspection.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the sparsity of radar point clouds, especially at long range, poses challenges for accurate detection. Existing methods increase point density through temporal aggregation with ego-motion compensation, but this approach introduces scatter from dynamic objects, degrading detection performance. We propose DoppDrive, a novel Doppler-Driven temporal aggregation method that enhances radar point cloud density while minimizing scatter. Points from previous frames are shifted radially according to their dynamic Doppler component to eliminate radial scatter, with each point assigned a unique aggregation duration based on its Doppler and angle to minimize tangential scatter. DoppDrive is a point cloud density enhancement step applied before detection, compatible with any detector, and we demonstrate that it significantly improves object detection performance across various detectors and datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |
| **[WXSOD: A Benchmark for Robust Salient Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12250v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) in complex environments remains a challenging research topic. Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and infrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the damage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with pixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of 14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding ground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm generalization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and a real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean images, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we propose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network (WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture. Specifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep features, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted from the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons against 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on WXSOD. The code and benchmark results will be made publicly available at https://github.com/C-water/WXSOD</p></details> | Under review | [Code Link](https://github.com/C-water/WXSOD) |
| **[Automated Model Evaluation for Object Detection via Prediction Consistency and Reliablity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12082v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR), which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods, and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/autoeval-det.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Oral | [Code Link](https://github.com/YonseiML/autoeval-det) |

Recent research has focused on enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation, searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension, retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs, tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy. Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of a paper accepted to MIPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[PEdger++: Practical Edge Detection via Assembling Cross Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11961v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge detection serves as a critical foundation for numerous computer vision applications, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image editing, by extracting essential structural cues that define object boundaries and salient edges. To be viable for broad deployment across devices with varying computational capacities, edge detectors shall balance high accuracy with low computational complexity. While deep learning has evidently improved accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs, limiting their applicability on resource-constrained devices. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving that balance: \textit{i.e.}, {how to efficiently capture discriminative features without relying on large-size and sophisticated models}. We propose PEdger++, a collaborative learning framework designed to reduce computational costs and model sizes while improving edge detection accuracy. The core principle of our PEdger++ is that cross-information derived from heterogeneous architectures, diverse training moments, and multiple parameter samplings, is beneficial to enhance learning from an ensemble perspective. Extensive experimental results on the BSDS500, NYUD and Multicue datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing clear improvements over existing methods. We also provide multiple versions of the model with varying computational requirements, highlighting PEdger++'s adaptability with respect to different resource constraints.

Multi-scale features are critical for object detection from point clouds. However, multi-scale feature learning usually involves multiple neighborhood searches and scale-aware layers, which can hinder efforts to achieve lightweight models and may not be conducive to research constrained by limited computational resources. This paper approximates point-based multi-scale features from a single neighborhood based on knowledge distillation. To compensate for the loss of constructive diversity in a single neighborhood, this paper designs a transferable feature embedding mechanism. Specifically, class-aware statistics are employed as transferable features given the small computational cost. In addition, this paper introduces the central weighted intersection over union for localization to alleviate the misalignment brought by the center offset in optimization. Note that the method presented in this paper saves computational costs. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of 55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and embedded optimization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data Shift of Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11868v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of machine learning technologies in autonomous driving systems, their role in addressing complex environmental perception challenges has become increasingly crucial. However, existing machine learning models exhibit significant vulnerability, as their performance critically depends on the fundamental assumption that training and testing data satisfy the independent and identically distributed condition, which is difficult to guarantee in real-world applications. Dynamic variations in data distribution caused by seasonal changes, weather fluctuations lead to data shift problems in autonomous driving systems. This study investigates the data shift problem in autonomous driving object detection tasks, systematically analyzing its complexity and diverse manifestations. We conduct a comprehensive review of data shift detection methods and employ shift detection analysis techniques to perform dataset categorization and balancing. Building upon this foundation, we construct an object detection model. To validate our approach, we optimize the model by integrating CycleGAN-based data augmentation techniques with the YOLOv5 framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to baseline models on the BDD100K dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

However, progress in this field is constrained by limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity, which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2) limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises 620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis, etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies.

While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task conflicts, and multi-scale fusion in AHBD. To tackle them, we propose TACR-YOLO, a new real-time framework for AHBD. We introduce a Coordinate Attention Module to enhance small object detection, a Task-Aware Attention Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD) dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves 91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies highlight the contribution of each improvement.

| **[Index-Aligned Query Distillation for Transformer-based Incremental Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11339v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task, Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[VFM-Guided Semi-Supervised Detection Transformer for Source-Free Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11167v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner, leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed, which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in source-free remote sensing detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to IEEE TGRS</p></details> | None |

Investigating the adversarial robustness of embodied vision navigation is crucial, especially given the threat of 3D physical attacks that could pose risks to human safety. However, existing attack methods for embodied vision navigation often lack physical feasibility due to challenges in transferring digital perturbations into the physical world. Moreover, current physical attacks for object detection struggle to achieve both multi-view effectiveness and visual naturalness in navigation scenarios. To address this, we propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching adversarial patches to objects, where both opacity and textures are learnable. Specifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a multi-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which optimizes the patch's texture based on feedback from the vision-based perception model used in navigation. To make the patch inconspicuous to human observers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, in which opacity is fine-tuned after texture optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our adversarial patches decrease the navigation success rate by an average of 22.39%, outperforming previous methods in practicality, effectiveness, and naturalness.

Early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This study investigates the application of deep learning-based object detection for early polyp identification using colonoscopy images. We utilize the Kvasir-SEG dataset, applying extensive data augmentation and splitting the data into training (80\%), validation (20\% of training), and testing (20\%) sets. Three variants of the YOLOv5 architecture (YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l) are evaluated. Experimental results show that YOLOv5l outperforms the other variants, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 85.1\%, with the highest average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.86. These findings demonstrate that YOLOv5l provides superior detection performance for colon polyp localization, offering a promising tool for enhancing colorectal cancer screening accuracy.</p></details> | 17 Pages | None |

Our recent work introduced GUIDER, our framework for inferring navigation and manipulation intents. We propose augmenting GUIDER with a vision-language model (VLM) and a text-only language model (LLM) to form a semantic prior that filters objects and locations based on the mission prompt. A vision pipeline (YOLO for object detection and the Segment Anything Model for instance segmentation) feeds candidate object crops into the VLM, which scores their relevance given an operator prompt; in addition, the list of detected object labels is ranked by a text-only LLM. These scores weight the existing navigation and manipulation layers of GUIDER, selecting context-relevant targets while suppressing unrelated objects. Once the combined belief exceeds a threshold, autonomy changes occur, enabling the robot to navigate to the desired area and retrieve the desired object, while adapting to any changes in the operator's intent. Future work will evaluate the system on Isaac Sim using a Franka Emika arm on a Ridgeback base, with a focus on real-time assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Human-Centered Robot Autonomy for Human-Robot Teams (HuRoboT) at IEEE RO-MAN 2025, Eindhoven, the Netherlands</p></details> | None |

Existing diffusion models often produce low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase. Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

A key concern is assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target) Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures, accepted to the Workshop on Public Trust in Autonomous Systems at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation</p></details> | None |

To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network (MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively.

Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric, Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets, both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous mAP-based metrics.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, PTQ often leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks. To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers. Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies, actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy. This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves 0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Accepted by ICCVW 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many real-world applications require solving both tasks jointly in a multi-task setting. We introduce a novel Two-Stage L2D framework for multi-task learning that integrates classification and regression through a unified deferral mechanism. Our method leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We derive explicit consistency bounds tied to the cross-entropy surrogate and the $L_1$-norm of agent-specific costs, and extend minimizability gap analysis to the multi-expert two-stage regime. We also make explicit how shared representation learning -- commonly used in multi-task models -- affects these consistency guarantees. Experiments on object detection and electronic health record analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the limitations of existing L2D methods in multi-task scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite notable advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning, existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity, and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability, reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent, trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone. Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans (DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with 2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection, classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across downstream applications and regulatory platforms.

However, existing methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality, simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision. To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST) that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training. Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Leveraging Motion Estimation for Efficient Bayer-Domain Computer Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15119v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing computer vision processing pipeline acquires visual information using an image sensor that captures pixel information in the Bayer pattern. The raw sensor data are then processed using an image signal processor (ISP) that first converts Bayer pixel data to RGB on a pixel by pixel basis, followed by video convolutional network (VCN) processing on a frame by frame basis. Both ISP and VCN are computationally expensive with high power consumption and latency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that eliminates the ISP and leverages motion estimation to accelerate video vision tasks directly in the Bayer domain. We introduce Motion Estimation-based Video Convolution (MEVC), which integrates sliding-window motion estimation into each convolutional layer, enabling prediction and residual-based refinement that reduces redundant computations across frames. This design bridges the structural gap between block-based motion estimation and spatial convolution, enabling accurate, low-cost processing. Our end-to-end pipeline supports raw Bayer input and achieves over 70\% reduction in FLOPs with minimal accuracy degradation across video semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection benchmarks, using both synthetic Bayer-converted and real Bayer video datasets. This framework generalizes across convolution-based models and marks the first effective reuse of motion estimation for accelerating video computer vision directly from raw sensor data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IPG: Incremental Patch Generation for Generalized Adversarial Patch Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10946v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore, IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Alerting to the presence of these objects is therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection, a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark potential applications of topological object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is an extension of an ACM MM'17 workshop paper (Xu et al, 2017), which was completed in late 2017 and early 2018 during the first author's doctoral studies at the University of Nottingham.

Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period (2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000 individual markings, which were then labeled and described using state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings" that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted. 13 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

ICL has recently been explored for computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task better and further improve the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks, achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module, correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$ improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its adaptation to visual inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse. Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection, demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous Mamba-based backbones, with particularly notable gains under high-resolution settings.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of 78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for time-sensitive operations.

As a common practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2 is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\% improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the model complexity by half.

However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new competitive results.

With the rapid advancement of deep learning, object detection algorithms have been widely applied in this area. However, the distribution of object classes in real-world prohibited item detection scenarios often exhibits a distinct long-tailed distribution. Due to the unique principles of X-ray imaging, conventional methods for long-tailed object detection are often ineffective in this domain. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Prior-Aware Debiasing Framework (PAD-F), a novel approach that employs a two-pronged strategy leveraging both material and co-occurrence priors. At the data level, our Explicit Material-Aware Augmentation (EMAA) component generates numerous challenging training samples for tail classes. It achieves this through a placement strategy guided by material-specific absorption rates and a gradient-based Poisson blending technique. At the feature level, the Implicit Co-occurrence Aggregator (ICA) acts as a plug-in module that enhances features for ambiguous objects by implicitly learning and aggregating statistical co-occurrence relationships within the image. Extensive experiments on the HiXray and PIDray datasets demonstrate that PAD-F significantly boosts the performance of multiple popular detectors. It achieves an absolute improvement of up to +17.2% in AP50 for tail classes and comprehensively outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides an effective and versatile solution to the critical problem of long-tailed detection in X-ray security.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

This approach allows for a much more efficient use of the paleographer's time and produces results that can compete and even outperform pixel-level segmentation in some use cases. Further experiments shed light on how to design a class ontology in order to make the best use of annotators' time and effort. Exploiting the presence of calibration cards in the image, we further annotate the data with the physical length in pixels and train regression neural networks to predict it from image patches.</p></details> |  | None |

These devices, often powered by energy-efficient microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment. Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.

However, mainstream AutoDA methods often encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric, search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data, enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample. Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks.

CBDES MoE integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS, demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

While UAVs offer the ability to navigate through dense environments and varying altitudes, they are limited by battery life, payload capacity, and flight duration, necessitating coordinated ground support. Focusing on heterogeneous navigation, SwarmVLM addresses these limitations by enabling semantic collaboration between UAVs and ground robots through impedance control. The system leverages the Vision Language Model (VLM) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to adjust impedance control parameters in response to environmental changes. In this framework, the UAV acts as a leader using Artificial Potential Field (APF) planning for real-time navigation, while the ground robot follows via virtual impedance links with adaptive link topology to avoid collisions with short obstacles. The system demonstrated a 92% success rate across 12 real-world trials. Under optimal lighting conditions, the VLM-RAG framework achieved 8% accuracy in object detection and selection of impedance parameters. The mobile robot prioritized short obstacle avoidance, occasionally resulting in a lateral deviation of up to 50 cm from the UAV path, which showcases safe navigation in a cluttered setting.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images. To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SparseTem: Boosting the Efficiency of CNN-Based Video Encoders by Exploiting Temporal Continuity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20790v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.</p></details> | 9 pages, 13 figures | None |

Despite their importance, publicly available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model (LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset construction in complex real-world domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Customized Knowledge Distillation for Chip-Level Dense Image Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13174v5)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been revealed that efficient dense image prediction (EDIP) models designed for AI chips, trained using the knowledge distillation (KD) framework, encounter two key challenges, including \emph{maintaining boundary region completeness} and \emph{ensuring target region connectivity}, despite their favorable real-time capacity to recognize the main object regions. In this work, we propose a customized boundary and context knowledge distillation (BCKD) method for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted KD from large accurate teacher models to compact small student models. Specifically, the \emph{boundary distillation} focuses on extracting explicit object-level boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Meanwhile, the \emph{context distillation} leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions. Our proposed method is specifically designed for the EDIP tasks and is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results across semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on five representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BCKD, resulting in well-defined object boundaries and smooth connecting regions.</p></details> | under submission | None |

Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, counting, \textit{etc}. To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts. To efficiently scale up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models. This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details and significantly improves multimodal perception ability, especially for small objects. Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer. It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts, and even coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC and phrase grounding, and outperform expert models in object detection, object counting, and REG.

| **[Enhancing Egocentric Object Detection in Static Environments using Graph-based Spatial Anomaly Detection and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07624v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However, state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work, we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%. This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models.

However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a 3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Firstly, we motivate the study using two separate real-world experiments to showcase that indeed glass failures would cause the detection based neural network models to fail. Secondly, we develop a simulation-based study using the physical process of the glass breakage to create perturbed scenarios, representing a realistic class of physics-based adversarial samples. Using a finite element model (FEM)-based approach, we generate surface cracks on the camera image by applying a stress field defined by particles within a triangular mesh. Lastly, we use physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to provide realistic visualizations of these physically plausible fractures. To analyze the safety implications, we superimpose these simulated broken glass effects as image filters on widely used open-source datasets: KITTI and BDD100K using two most prominent object detection neural networks (CNN-based -- YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN) and Pyramid Vision Transformers. To further investigate the distributional impact of these visual distortions, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between three distinct data distributions, applying various broken glass filters to a custom dataset (captured through a cracked windshield), as well as the KITTI and Kaggle cats and dogs datasets. The K-L divergence analysis suggests that these broken glass filters do not introduce significant distributional shifts.</p></details> |  | None |

Self-distillation recently is emerging as a promising approach for fine-tuning VLMs to better adapt to local regions without requiring extensive annotations. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from significant `foreground bias', where models tend to wrongly identify background regions as foreground objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. DenseVLM leverages the pre-trained VLM to retrieve categories for unlabeled regions and then decouples the interference between foreground and background features. We show that DenseVLM can directly replace the original VLM in open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation methods, leading to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, it exhibits promising zero-shot scalability when training on more extensive and diverse datasets.

However, most KD methods treat all samples uniformly, overlooking the varying learning value of each sample and thereby limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Entropy-based Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (EA-KD), a simple yet effective plug-and-play KD method that prioritizes learning from valuable samples. EA-KD quantifies each sample's learning value by strategically combining the entropy of the teacher and student output, then dynamically reweights the distillation loss to place greater emphasis on high-entropy samples. Extensive experiments across diverse KD frameworks and tasks -- including image classification, object detection, and large language model (LLM) distillation -- demonstrate that EA-KD consistently enhances performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with negligible computational cost.

However, achieving this capability in lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks.

Traditional approaches treat detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view detection and forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

To address this, we propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model designed to enhance Complex VQA performance through the deep fusion of diverse visual and linguistic information. MV-CoRe meticulously integrates global embeddings from pre-trained Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Language Large Models (LLMs) with fine-grained semantic-aware visual features, including object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks, including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of both object and scene graph features, and human evaluations further validate MV-CoRe's superior factual correctness and reasoning depth, underscoring its robust capabilities for deep visual and conceptual understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task. The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention (MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

While vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline. DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores, expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment, especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, Preprint under review.

However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising <2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models.

While a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, most of these studies have overlooked the valuable prior knowledge embedded within remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be useful because remote sensing objects may be mistakenly recognized without referencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different objects. This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone. LSKNet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing images. Without bells and whistles, our lightweight LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art scores on standard remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our comprehensive analysis further validated the significance of the identified priors and the effectiveness of LSKNet.

Although both are class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks. However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks, assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy (SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our proposed method.

This in turn has led to a lack of research into machine understanding for low-light images and (in particular) videos. A common approach is to apply annotations obtained from high quality datasets to synthetically created low light versions. In addition, these approaches are often limited through the use of unrealistic noise models. In this paper, we propose a new Degradation Estimation Network (DEN), which synthetically generates realistic standard RGB (sRGB) noise without the requirement for camera metadata. This is achieved by estimating the parameters of physics-informed noise distributions, trained in a self-supervised manner. This zero-shot approach allows our method to generate synthetic noisy content with a diverse range of realistic noise characteristics, unlike other methods which focus on recreating the noise characteristics of the training data. We evaluate our proposed synthetic pipeline using various methods trained on its synthetic data for typical low-light tasks including synthetic noise replication, video enhancement, and object detection, showing improvements of up to 24\% KLD, 21\% LPIPS, and 62\% AP$_{50-95}$, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

While the initial VLM weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities. Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen, retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks. However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation. Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of 224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models.

To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to explore multi-task generation for remote sensing, tackling the challenge of limited generalization in task-oriented synthesis for RSI interpretation. EarthSynth, trained on the EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training strategy with a three-dimensional batch-sample selection mechanism to improve training data diversity and enhance category control.

However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs. Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and deployability.</p></details> |  | None |

ULU treats positive and negative inputs differently. Extensive experiments demonstrate ULU significantly outperforms ReLU and Mish across image classification and object detection tasks. Its variant Adaptive ULU (\textbf{AULU}) is expressed as $\{f(x;\beta_1^2),x=0 \}$, where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are learnable parameters, enabling it to adapt its response separately for positive and negative inputs. Additionally, we introduce the LIB (Like Inductive Bias) metric from AULU to quantitatively measure the inductive bias of the model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CSRAP: Enhanced Canvas Attention Scheduling for Real-Time Mission Critical Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04976v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area, called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i) allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision (mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Label Error Detection to Correction: A Modular Framework and Benchmark for Object Detection Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06556v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels, incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features, boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query adaptation and dual-stream attention.

BEV perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to conventional task-specific optimizations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04489v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample. Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of publication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Nonlocal Retinex-Based Variational Model and its Deep Unfolding Twin for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07810v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images captured under low-light conditions present significant limitations in many applications, as poor lighting can obscure details, reduce contrast, and hide noise. Removing the illumination effects and enhancing the quality of such images is crucial for many tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection. In this paper, we propose a variational method for low-light image enhancement based on the Retinex decomposition into illumination, reflectance, and noise components. A color correction pre-processing step is applied to the low-light image, which is then used as the observed input in the decomposition. Moreover, our model integrates a novel nonlocal gradient-type fidelity term designed to preserve structural details. Additionally, we propose an automatic gamma correction module. Building on the proposed variational approach, we extend the model by introducing its deep unfolding counterpart, in which the proximal operators are replaced with learnable networks. We propose cross-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in both the nonlocal prior of the reflectance and the nonlocal gradient-based constraint. Experimental results demonstrate that both methods compare favorably with several recent and state-of-the-art techniques across different datasets. In particular, despite not relying on learning strategies, the variational model outperforms most deep learning approaches both visually and in terms of quality metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

This study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this, a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at the 13th European Workshop on Visual Information Processing (EUVIP 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, static fusion heuristics and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines, DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95 across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE DSAA 2025 (10 pages, 5 figures)</p></details> | None |

By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs.

Despite the tremendous advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516 meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods, distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level, neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation). We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, This paper was submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems</p></details> | None |

Existing methods often rely on the score matching from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this, we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object \textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations. Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference, further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks, increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second, AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to 83% with superior speed and imperceptibility.

Leveraging a theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures, highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

While for normal size models, pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working conditions are different.</p></details> |  | None |

With the publication of Visual Transformers, we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such, it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper, we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity. Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction methodologies and detection algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the development of image analysis methods for EBCs is challenging due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of the data. This work addresses the problem of object detection for EBC cameras. The current approaches to EBC object detection focus on constructing complex data representations and rely on specialized architectures. We introduce I2EvDet (Image-to-Event Detection), a novel adaptation framework that bridges mainstream object detection with temporal event data processing. First, we demonstrate that a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer, or RT-DETR, a state-of-the-art natural image detector, trained on a simple image-like representation of the EBC data achieves performance comparable to specialized EBC methods. Next, as part of our framework, we develop an efficient adaptation technique that transforms image-based detectors into event-based detection models by modifying their frozen latent representation space through minimal architectural additions. The resulting EvRT-DETR model reaches state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark datasets Gen1 (mAP $+2.3$) and 1Mpx/Gen4 (mAP $+1.4$).

However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. To underpin of efficiency of our approach we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns, particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception models.</p></details> | <details><summary>J.

While human-object interaction (HOI) detection has made some progress in general-purpose video downstream tasks, when applied to recognize the interaction behaviors between a streamer and different objects in livestreaming, it tends to focuses too much on the objects and neglects their interactions with the streamer, which leads to object bias. To solve this issue, we propose a prototype embedding optimization for human-object interaction detection (PeO-HOI). First, the livestreaming is preprocessed using object detection and tracking techniques to extract features of the human-object (HO) pairs. Then, prototype embedding optimization is adopted to mitigate the effect of object bias on HOI. Finally, after modelling the spatio-temporal context between HO pairs, the HOI detection results are obtained by the prediction head. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed PeO-HOI method has detection accuracies of 37.19%@full, 51.42%@non-rare, 26.20%@rare on the publicly available dataset VidHOI, 45.13%@full, 62.78%@non-rare and 30.37%@rare on the self-built dataset BJUT-HOI, which effectively improves the HOI detection performance in livestreaming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE MMSP 2025</p></details> | None |

Robots must analyze interactions with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified. Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis. Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets. The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is optimal for this task.</p></details> |  | None |

COLER first uses our developed CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image. We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models, but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.</p></details> |  | None |

While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios. Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution, offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both. Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception.

Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation. For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275, improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all scale-agnostic metrics.

Although neuromorphic event cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features, and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by 7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we pioneer in probing the cross-device (cameras & robotics) grasping policy in the 3D open world. Specifically, we construct two real-world grasping setups, employing robotic arms and cameras from completely different manufacturers. To minimize domain differences in point clouds from diverse cameras, we adopt clustering methods to generate 3D object proposals. However, existing clustering methods are limited to closed-set scenarios, which confines the robotic graspable object categories and ossifies the deployment scenarios. To extend these methods to open-world settings, we introduce the SSGC-Seg module that enables category-agnostic 3D object detection. The proposed module transforms the original multi-class semantic information into binary semantic cues-foreground and background by analyzing the SoftMax value of each point, and then clusters the foreground points based on geometric information to form initial object proposals. Furthermore, ScoreNet{\ddag} is designed to score each detection result, and the robotic arm prioritizes grasping the object with the highest confidence score. Experiments on two different types of setups highlight the effectiveness and robustness of our policy for cross-device robotics grasping research. Our code is provided in the supplementary and will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Advancing Supervised Local Learning Beyond Classification with Long-term Feature Bank](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00446v4)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local learning offers an alternative to traditional end-to-end back-propagation in deep neural networks, significantly reducing GPU memory consumption. Although it has shown promise in image classification tasks, its extension to other visual tasks has been limited. This limitation arises primarily from two factors: 1) architectures designed specifically for classification are not readily adaptable to other tasks, which prevents the effective reuse of task-specific knowledge from architectures tailored to different problems; 2) these classification-focused architectures typically lack cross-scale feature communication, leading to degraded performance in tasks like object detection and super-resolution. To address these challenges, we propose the Feature Bank Augmented auxiliary network (FBA), which introduces a simplified design principle and incorporates a feature bank to enhance cross-task adaptability and communication. This work represents the first successful application of local learning methods beyond classification, demonstrating that FBA not only conserves GPU memory but also achieves performance on par with end-to-end approaches across multiple datasets for various visual tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present a systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders, employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance, especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8 achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for label-efficient object detection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate, real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus, for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data, independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

This architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial inspections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 ICCV VISION Workshop</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose CoDAv2, a unified framework designed to innovatively tackle both the localization and classification of novel 3D objects, under the condition of limited base categories. For localization, the proposed 3D Novel Object Discovery (3D-NOD) strategy utilizes 3D geometries and 2D open-vocabulary semantic priors to discover pseudo labels for novel objects during training. 3D-NOD is further extended with an Enrichment strategy that significantly enriches the novel object distribution in the training scenes, and then enhances the model's ability to localize more novel objects. The 3D-NOD with Enrichment is termed 3D-NODE. For classification, the Discovery-driven Cross-modal Alignment (DCMA) module aligns features from 3D point clouds and 2D/textual modalities, employing both class-agnostic and class-specific alignments that are iteratively refined to handle the expanding vocabulary of objects. Besides, 2D box guidance boosts the classification accuracy against complex background noises, which is coined as Box-DCMA. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of CoDAv2. CoDAv2 outperforms the best-performing method by a large margin (AP_Novel of 9.17 vs. 3.61 on SUN-RGBD and 9.12 vs. 3.74 on ScanNetv2).

| **[Adverse Weather-Independent Framework Towards Autonomous Driving Perception through Temporal Correlation and Unfolded Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01583v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various adverse weather conditions such as fog and rain pose a significant challenge to autonomous driving (AD) perception tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, etc. The common domain adaption strategy is to minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather conditions. However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain in practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and performs poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse weather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model architecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is achieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of clear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition. Specifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential Mechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to achieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind arbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed to shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence to prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded Regularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather generalization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess the proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.14737</p></details> | None |

However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense, stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes. This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption, limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network, which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion methods with dense LiDAR scanning.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional label-efficient methods focus on object-centric features, neglecting contextual semantic relationships that are critical in complex scenes. In this work, we propose a Context-Aware Weak Supervision for Monocular 3D object detection, namely CA-W3D, to address this limitation in a two-stage training paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a pre-training stage employing Region-wise Object Contrastive Matching (ROCM), which aligns regional object embeddings derived from a trainable monocular 3D encoder and a frozen open-vocabulary 2D visual grounding model. This alignment encourages the monocular encoder to discriminate scene-specific attributes and acquire richer contextual knowledge. In the second stage, we incorporate a pseudo-label training process with a Dual-to-One Distillation (D2OD) mechanism, which effectively transfers contextual priors into the monocular encoder while preserving spatial fidelity and maintaining computational efficiency during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on the public KITTI benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing the SoTA method over all metrics, highlighting the importance of contextual-aware knowledge in weakly-supervised monocular 3D detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6 FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers stable performance.

Two key challenges in Knowledge Distillation (KD) are: 1) balancing learning from the teacher's guidance and the task objective, and 2) handling the disparity in knowledge representation between teacher and student models. To address these, we propose Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation (MoKD). MoKD tackles two main gradient issues: a) Gradient Conflicts, where task-specific and distillation gradients are misaligned, and b) Gradient Dominance, where one objective's gradient dominates, causing imbalance. MoKD reformulates KD as a multi-objective optimization problem, enabling better balance between objectives. Additionally, it introduces a subspace learning framework to project feature representations into a high-dimensional space, improving knowledge transfer. Our MoKD is demonstrated to outperform existing methods through extensive experiments on image classification using the ImageNet-1K dataset and object detection using the COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, MoKD models also achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to models trained from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major changes to the paper and the authorship</p></details> | None |

In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the ``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma parameters for the two domains.</p></details> |  | None |

However, our analysis indicates that under the full fine-tuning paradigm, the feature space becomes highly constrained and low-ranked, which has been proven to seriously impair generalization. One solution is freezing parameters to preserve pre-trained knowledge and thus maintain diversity of the feature space. To this end, we propose IV-tuning, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various IR-VIS downstream tasks, including salient object detection, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Compared with the full fine-tuning baselines and existing IR-VIS methods, IV-tuning facilitates the learning of complementary information between infrared and visible modalities with less than 3% of the backbone parameters, and effectively alleviates the overfitting problem.

Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Our work makes three contributions: First, we present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance. Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets. This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.</p></details> |  | None |

We re-examined the DETR-inspired detection head and found substantial redundancy in its self-attention module. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header inspired by human visual perception: when observing an object, we always concentrate on one site, perceive the surrounding environment, and glance around the object. This mechanism enables each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature dimensions and scale information from different patterns. CSDN provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-trained weights can significantly improve the detection accuracy.</p></details> | 7pages, 7figures | None |

Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard, vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness and contribute to long-term space sustainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Wireless for Space and Extreme Environments (WiSEE 2025)</p></details> | None |

Despite achieving high detection performance, most of the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29% reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2% drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at the Embedded Vision Workshop ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, obtaining such annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is limited.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reducing the gap between general purpose data and aerial images in concentrated solar power plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00440v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for rapid deployment in industrial applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment, significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling.

However, such pairs often contain noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | Work in progress | None |

Multi-level semantic understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations: Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI, and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter, facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving community.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Robust 3D Object Detection using Probabilistic Point Clouds from Single-Photon LiDARs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00169v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects, producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds. We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

However, this conventional approach overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon, an efficient encoder-decoder self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that supports joint contrastive pre-training. We first extend existing SSL architectures to accommodate diverse decoders and their corresponding contrastive losses. Then, we introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives to enable the joint pre-training of encoder-decoder architectures. By adapting an established contrastive SSL framework for dense prediction tasks, DeCon achieves new state-of-the-art results: on COCO object detection and instance segmentation when pre-trained on COCO dataset; across almost all dense downstream benchmark tasks when pre-trained on COCO+ and ImageNet-1K. Our results demonstrate that joint pre-training enhances the representation power of the encoder and improves performance in dense prediction tasks. This gain persists across heterogeneous decoder architectures, various encoder architectures, and in out-of-domain limited-data scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally, the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba.

Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD). We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed 3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and achieve new state-of-the-art results.

However, existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically, ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training. Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

To address the problem of feature extraction limitation and information loss in the existing YOLO-based models, this study propose You Only Look Once for Fire Detection with Attention-guided Inverted Residual and Dual-pooling Downscale Fusion (YOLO-FireAD) with two core innovations: (1) Attention-guided Inverted Residual Block (AIR) integrates hybrid channel-spatial attention with inverted residuals to adaptively enhance fire features and suppress environmental noise; (2) Dual Pool Downscale Fusion Block (DPDF) preserves multi-scale fire patterns through learnable fusion of max-average pooling outputs, mitigating small-fire detection failures. Extensive evaluation on two public datasets shows the efficient performance of our model. Our proposed model keeps the sum amount of parameters (1.45M, 51.8% lower than YOLOv8n) (4.6G, 43.2% lower than YOLOv8n), and mAP75 is higher than the mainstream real-time object detection models YOLOv8n, YOL-Ov9t, YOLOv10n, YOLO11n, YOLOv12n and other YOLOv8 variants 1.3-5.5%.

However, TIR images typically suffer from heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Thermal Infrared in Robotics (TIRO) Workshop, ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DISTIL: Data-Free Inversion of Suspicious Trojan Inputs via Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22813v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious "shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training. Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier; through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to 7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong prior assumptions about triggers.

R-LiViT captures three intersections during both day and night, ensuring a diverse dataset. It includes 10,000 LiDAR frames and 2,400 temporally and spatially aligned RGB and thermal images across 150 traffic scenarios, with 7 and 8 annotated classes respectively, providing a comprehensive resource for tasks such as object detection and tracking.

However, existing methods often construct BEV representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next, we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving 49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set.

Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.01788, arXiv:2304.01168 by other authors</p></details> | None |

Recent works show that when trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts. Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

Ground based tracking requires setting up infrastructure, could be range limited, and may not be feasible in remote areas, crowded cities or in dense vegetation areas. Vision based active tracking of aerial objects from another airborne vehicle, e.g., a chaser unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), promises to fill this important gap, along with serving aerial coordination use cases. Vision-based active tracking by a UAV entails solving two coupled problems: 1) compute-efficient and accurate (target) object detection and target state estimation; and 2) maneuver decisions to ensure that the target remains in the field of view in the future time-steps and favorably positioned for continued detection. As a solution to the first problem, this paper presents a novel integration of standard deep learning based architectures with Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) to achieve compute-efficient object detection without compromising accuracy, unlike standalone learning or filtering approaches. The proposed perception framework is validated using a lab-scale setup. For the second problem, to obviate the linearity assumptions and background variations limiting effectiveness of the traditional controllers, we present the use of reinforcement learning to train a neuro-controller for fast computation of velocity maneuvers. New state space, action space and reward formulations are developed for this purpose, and training is performed in simulation using AirSim. The trained model is also tested in AirSim with respect to complex target maneuvers, and is found to outperform a baseline PID control in terms of tracking up-time and average distance maintained (from the target) during tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of AIAA Aviation 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing RGB-D VSOD models have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD. Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined features.

This work is typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25 fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area. Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025's Joint Workshop on Marine Vision (ICCVW, CVAUI&AAMVEM).

It presents technical challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

| **[Rethinking Multi-Modal Object Detection from the Perspective of Mono-Modality Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11780v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Modal Object Detection (MMOD), due to its stronger adaptability to various complex environments, has been widely applied in various applications. Extensive research is dedicated to the RGB-IR object detection, primarily focusing on how to integrate complementary features from RGB-IR modalities. However, they neglect the mono-modality insufficient learning problem, which arises from decreased feature extraction capability in multi-modal joint learning. This leads to a prevalent but unreasonable phenomenon\textemdash Fusion Degradation, which hinders the performance improvement of the MMOD model. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce linear probing evaluation to the multi-modal detectors and rethink the multi-modal object detection task from the mono-modality learning perspective. Therefore, we construct a novel framework called M$^2$D-LIF, which consists of the Mono-Modality Distillation (M$^2$D) method and the Local Illumination-aware Fusion (LIF) module. The M$^2$D-LIF framework facilitates the sufficient learning of mono-modality during multi-modal joint training and explores a lightweight yet effective feature fusion manner to achieve superior object detection performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three MMOD datasets demonstrate that our M$^2$D-LIF effectively mitigates the Fusion Degradation phenomenon and outperforms the previous SOTA detectors.

| **[ATR-UMMIM: A Benchmark Dataset for UAV-Based Multimodal Image Registration under Complex Imaging Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20764v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction. However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios.

While recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86% while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost. These results demonstrate that PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS across diverse vision tasks.</p></details> | 14pages | None |
| **[LSFDNet: A Single-Stage Fusion and Detection Network for Ships Using SWIR and LWIR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20574v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches, such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks, achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features. Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features, thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion detection algorithm on two datasets.

The ISB module innovatively reconstructs feature maps to establish an efficient full-channel global attention mechanism through synergistic fusion of batch-statistical and instance-specific features. Complementing this, the ISADH module pioneers an asymmetric decoupled architecture enabling hierarchical multi-dimensional feature integration via dual-stream batch-instance representation fusion. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the coordinated deployment of ISB and ISADH in the YOLO-PRO framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all computational scales. Specifically, YOLO-PRO surpasses YOLOv8 by 1.0-1.6% AP (N/S/M/L/X scales) and outperforms YOLO11 by 0.1-0.5% AP in critical N/M/L/X groups, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. This work provides practical insights for developing high-precision detectors deployable on edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[An Improved YOLOv8 Approach for Small Target Detection of Rice Spikelet Flowering in Field Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20506v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing. Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%, representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively, over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set, meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2 offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Point Cloud Self-supervised Learning via 3D to Multi-view Masked Learner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10887v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multi-modal masked autoencoders (MAE) has been introduced in 3D self-supervised learning, offering enhanced feature learning by leveraging both 2D and 3D data to capture richer cross-modal representations. However, these approaches have two limitations: (1) they inefficiently require both 2D and 3D modalities as inputs, even though the inherent multi-view properties of 3D point clouds already contain 2D modality. (2) input 2D modality causes the reconstruction learning to unnecessarily rely on visible 2D information, hindering 3D geometric representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D to Multi-View Learner (Multi-View ML) that only utilizes 3D modalities as inputs and effectively capture rich spatial information in 3D point clouds. Specifically, we first project 3D point clouds to multi-view 2D images at the feature level based on 3D-based pose. Then, we introduce two components: (1) a 3D to multi-view autoencoder that reconstructs point clouds and multi-view images from 3D and projected 2D features; (2) a multi-scale multi-head (MSMH) attention mechanism that facilitates local-global information interactions in each decoder transformer block through attention heads at various scales. Additionally, a novel two-stage self-training strategy is proposed to align 2D and 3D representations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts across various downstream tasks, including 3D classification, part segmentation, and object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.

However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network (WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection. Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

When integrating such models into aeronautical applications, a top-down safety assessment process must influence both the model performance metrics selected, and their acceptable range of values. Often, however, the relationship of system safety objectives to model performance requirements and the associated metrics is unclear. Using an example of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt component (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first describes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior. Then, based on that abstraction, an initial method is given to derive the minimum safety-related performance requirements, the associated metrics, and their targets for the both MLC and its underlying deep neural network, such that they meet the quantitative safety objectives obtained from the safety assessment process. We give rationale as to why the proposed method should be considered valid, also clarifying the assumptions made, the constraints on applicability, and the implications for verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, Expanded version of the paper: G.

Current approaches face significant limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting," and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering. Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data, while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved annotation quality of our visualization system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures | None |

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance.

However, the roles of existing decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number (fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention (query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det, a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible. Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process), addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects. Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of DS-Det.

Existing approaches that use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.</p></details> | ICCVW 2025 | None |

While recent deep learning-based approaches have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme: feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time, making it well-suited for real-time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 36th British Machine Vision Conference</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

These features are continuously updated via over-the-air (OTA) mechanisms, resulting in a growing number of software versions and variants due to the diversity of vehicles, cloud/edge environments, and stakeholders involved. The lack of a unified integration environment further complicates development, as connected mobility solutions are often built in isolation. To ensure reliable operations across heterogeneous systems, a dynamic orchestration of functions that considers hardware and software variability is essential. This paper presents an open-source CI/CD pipeline tailored for SDVs. It automates the build, test, and deployment phases using a combination of containerized open-source tools, creating a standardized, portable, and scalable ecosystem accessible to all stakeholders. Additionally, a custom OTA middleware distributes software updates and supports rollbacks across vehicles and backend services. Update variants are derived based on deployment target dependencies and hardware configurations. The pipeline also supports continuous development and deployment of AI models for autonomous driving features. Its effectiveness is evaluated using an automated valet parking (AVP) scenario involving TurtleBots and a coordinating backend server.

| **[TARS: Traffic-Aware Radar Scene Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10210v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene flow provides crucial motion information for autonomous driving. Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet transmitting raw point clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark, EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately 1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve. These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> | None |

To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However, effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection.

Existing roadside perception methods concentrate on model design but overlook data issues like calibration errors, sparse information, and multi-view consistency, leading to poor performance on recent published datasets. To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70. RoCo-Sim fills a critical gap in roadside perception simulation.

Existing methods primarily extract features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach addresses the limitations of conventional methods by leveraging deep learning architectures for object detection, particularly for tabular data extraction, and integrating cloud-based services for scalable document processing. The proposed methodology demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency in extracting structured information from diverse document formats including PDFs, images, and scanned documents.

In this paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm, which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network (NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN). Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)</p></details> | None |

Existing methods are primarily CNN-based and improve robustness through data augmentation combined with feature alignment. However, these methods are limited, as augmentation is only effective when the synthetic distribution approximates that of unseen domains, thus failing to ensure generalization across diverse scenarios. While DEtection TRansformer (DETR) has shown strong generalization in domain adaptation due to global context modeling, its potential for SDG remains underexplored. To this end, we propose Style-Adaptive DEtection TRansformer (SA-DETR), a DETR-based detector tailored for SDG. SA-DETR introduces an online domain style adapter that projects the style representation of unseen domains into the source domain via a dynamic memory bank. This bank self-organizes into diverse style prototypes and is continuously updated under a test-time adaptation framework, enabling effective style rectification. Additionally, we design an object-aware contrastive learning module to promote extraction of domain-invariant features. By applying gating masks that constrain contrastive learning in both spatial and semantic dimensions, this module facilitates instance-level cross-domain contrast and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments across five distinct weather scenarios demonstrate that SA-DETR consistently outperforms existing methods in both detection accuracy and domain generalization capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</p></details> | None |

This study evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI) approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour. The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to 1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%, and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required to search large vehicle images datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WiSE-OD: Benchmarking Robustness in Infrared Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18925v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally, to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants: WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or inference cost.</p></details> | 8 pages, conference | None |
| **[Synthetic-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18911v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework (CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization. Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD.

| **[Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

| **[Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks.

Here, we focus on graphical humor as a paradigmatic example of image interpretation that requires elucidating the interaction of different scene elements in the context of prior cognitive knowledge. This paper introduces \textbf{HumorDB}, a novel, controlled, and carefully curated dataset designed to evaluate and advance visual humor understanding by AI systems. The dataset comprises diverse images spanning photos, cartoons, sketches, and AI-generated content, including minimally contrastive pairs where subtle edits differentiate between humorous and non-humorous versions. We evaluate humans, state-of-the-art vision models, and large vision-language models on three tasks: binary humor classification, funniness rating prediction, and pairwise humor comparison. The results reveal a gap between current AI systems and human-level humor understanding. While pretrained vision-language models perform better than vision-only models, they still struggle with abstract sketches and subtle humor cues. Analysis of attention maps shows that even when models correctly classify humorous images, they often fail to focus on the precise regions that make the image funny. Preliminary mechanistic interpretability studies and evaluation of model explanations provide initial insights into how different architectures process humor. Our results identify promising trends and current limitations, suggesting that an effective understanding of visual humor requires sophisticated architectures capable of detecting subtle contextual features and bridging the gap between visual perception and abstract reasoning.

Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under consideration at Image and Vision Computing</p></details> | None |

Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France. We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these infrastructures in a given area at a given time.</p></details> |  | None |

At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search. SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18 benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models.

Furthermore, we propose a sparse volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry.

While LMMs have demonstrated promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection, revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models.

Experimental results demonstrate a classification accuracy of 99%, with a power consumption of 3.5W and a processing speed of 9 frames per second (FPS). These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling real-time, resource-efficient object detection and classification for edge computing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the 67th International Symposium on ELMAR 2025</p></details> | None |
