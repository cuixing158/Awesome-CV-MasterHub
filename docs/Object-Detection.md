| **[MambaVision: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Vision Backbone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08083v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone, MambaVision, specifically tailored for vision applications. Our core contribution includes redesigning the Mamba formulation to enhance its capability for efficient modeling of visual features. Through a comprehensive ablation study, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Vision Transformers (ViT) with Mamba. Our results show that equipping the Mamba architecture with self-attention blocks in the final layers greatly improves its capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. Based on these findings, we introduce a family of MambaVision models with a hierarchical architecture to meet various design criteria. For classification on the ImageNet-1K dataset, MambaVision variants achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of both Top-1 accuracy and throughput. In downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation on MS COCO and ADE20K datasets, MambaVision outperforms comparably sized backbones while demonstrating favorable performance.

| **[Interpreting Object-level Foundation Models via Visual Precision Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16198v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in multimodal pre-training have propelled object-level foundation models, such as Grounding DINO and Florence-2, in tasks like visual grounding and object detection. However, interpreting these models' decisions has grown increasingly challenging. Existing interpretable attribution methods for object-level task interpretation have notable limitations: (1) gradient-based methods lack precise localization due to visual-textual fusion in foundation models, and (2) perturbation-based methods produce noisy saliency maps, limiting fine-grained interpretability. To address these, we propose a Visual Precision Search method that generates accurate attribution maps with fewer regions. Our method bypasses internal model parameters to overcome attribution issues from multimodal fusion, dividing inputs into sparse sub-regions and using consistency and collaboration scores to accurately identify critical decision-making regions. We also conducted a theoretical analysis of the boundary guarantees and scope of applicability of our method. Experiments on RefCOCO, MS COCO, and LVIS show our approach enhances object-level task interpretability over SOTA for Grounding DINO and Florence-2 across various evaluation metrics, with faithfulness gains of 23.7%, 31.6%, and 20.1% on MS COCO, LVIS, and RefCOCO for Grounding DINO, and 102.9% and 66.9% on MS COCO and RefCOCO for Florence-2. Additionally, our method can interpret failures in visual grounding and object detection tasks, surpassing existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

| **[Mind the Gap: Benchmarking Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19707v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools, excelling in tasks that integrate visual and textual comprehension, such as image captioning, visual question answering, and image-text retrieval. However, existing benchmarks for VLMs include spatial components, which often fail to isolate spatial reasoning from related tasks such as object detection or semantic comprehension. In this paper, we address these deficiencies with a multi-faceted approach towards understanding spatial reasoning. Informed by the diverse and multi-dimensional nature of human spatial reasoning abilities, we present a detailed analysis that first delineates the core elements of spatial reasoning: spatial relations, orientation and navigation, mental rotation, and spatial visualization, and then assesses the performance of these models in both synthetic and real-world images, bridging controlled and naturalistic contexts. We analyze 13 state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models, uncovering pivotal insights into their spatial reasoning performance. Our results reveal profound shortcomings in current VLMs, with average accuracy across the 13 models approximating random chance, highlighting spatial reasoning as a persistent obstacle. This work not only exposes the pressing need to advance spatial reasoning within VLMs but also establishes a solid platform for future exploration.

| **[BiblioPage: A Dataset of Scanned Title Pages for Bibliographic Metadata Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19658v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual digitization of bibliographic metadata is time consuming and labor intensive, especially for historical and real-world archives with highly variable formatting across documents. Despite advances in machine learning, the absence of dedicated datasets for metadata extraction hinders automation. To address this gap, we introduce BiblioPage, a dataset of scanned title pages annotated with structured bibliographic metadata. The dataset consists of approximately 2,000 monograph title pages collected from 14 Czech libraries, spanning a wide range of publication periods, typographic styles, and layout structures. Each title page is annotated with 16 bibliographic attributes, including title, contributors, and publication metadata, along with precise positional information in the form of bounding boxes. To extract structured information from this dataset, we valuated object detection models such as YOLO and DETR combined with transformer-based OCR, achieving a maximum mAP of 52 and an F1 score of 59. Additionally, we assess the performance of various visual large language models, including LlamA 3.2-Vision and GPT-4o, with the best model reaching an F1 score of 67. BiblioPage serves as a real-world benchmark for bibliographic metadata extraction, contributing to document understanding, document question answering, and document information extraction.

| **[Single Shot AI-assisted quantification of KI-67 proliferation index in breast cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19606v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable quantification of Ki-67, a key proliferation marker in breast cancer, is essential for molecular subtyping and informed treatment planning. Conventional approaches, including visual estimation and manual counting, suffer from interobserver variability and limited reproducibility. This study introduces an AI-assisted method using the YOLOv8 object detection framework for automated Ki-67 scoring. High-resolution digital images (40x magnification) of immunohistochemically stained tumor sections were captured from Ki-67 hotspot regions and manually annotated by a domain expert to distinguish Ki-67-positive and negative tumor cells. The dataset was augmented and divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) subsets. Among the YOLOv8 variants tested, the Medium model achieved the highest performance, with a mean Average Precision at 50% Intersection over Union (mAP50) exceeding 85% for Ki-67-positive cells. The proposed approach offers an efficient, scalable, and objective alternative to conventional scoring methods, supporting greater consistency in Ki-67 evaluation. Future directions include developing user-friendly clinical interfaces and expanding to multi-institutional datasets to enhance generalizability and facilitate broader adoption in diagnostic practice.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Which2comm: An Efficient Collaborative Perception Framework for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17175v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception allows real-time inter-agent information exchange and thus offers invaluable opportunities to enhance the perception capabilities of individual agents. However, limited communication bandwidth in practical scenarios restricts the inter-agent data transmission volume, consequently resulting in performance declines in collaborative perception systems. This implies a trade-off between perception performance and communication cost. To address this issue, we propose Which2comm, a novel multi-agent 3D object detection framework leveraging object-level sparse features. By integrating semantic information of objects into 3D object detection boxes, we introduce semantic detection boxes (SemDBs). Innovatively transmitting these information-rich object-level sparse features among agents not only significantly reduces the demanding communication volume, but also improves 3D object detection performance. Specifically, a fully sparse network is constructed to extract SemDBs from individual agents; a temporal fusion approach with a relative temporal encoding mechanism is utilized to obtain the comprehensive spatiotemporal features. Extensive experiments on the V2XSet and OPV2V datasets demonstrate that Which2comm consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both perception performance and communication cost, exhibiting better robustness to real-world latency. These results present that for multi-agent collaborative 3D object detection, transmitting only object-level sparse features is sufficient to achieve high-precision and robust performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CQ-DINO: Mitigating Gradient Dilution via Category Queries for Vast Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18430v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the exponential growth of data, traditional object detection methods are increasingly struggling to handle vast vocabulary object detection tasks effectively. We analyze two key limitations of classification-based detectors: positive gradient dilution, where rare positive categories receive insufficient learning signals, and hard negative gradient dilution, where discriminative gradients are overwhelmed by numerous easy negatives. To address these challenges, we propose CQ-DINO, a category query-based object detection framework that reformulates classification as a contrastive task between object queries and learnable category queries. Our method introduces image-guided query selection, which reduces the negative space by adaptively retrieving top-K relevant categories per image via cross-attention, thereby rebalancing gradient distributions and facilitating implicit hard example mining. Furthermore, CQ-DINO flexibly integrates explicit hierarchical category relationships in structured datasets (e.g., V3Det) or learns implicit category correlations via self-attention in generic datasets (e.g., COCO). Experiments demonstrate that CQ-DINO achieves superior performance on the challenging V3Det benchmark (surpassing previous methods by 2.1% AP) while maintaining competitiveness in COCO. Our work provides a scalable solution for real-world detection systems requiring wide category coverage. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/RedAIGC/CQ-DINO.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/RedAIGC/CQ-DINO) |
| **[CKD: Contrastive Knowledge Distillation from A Sample-wise Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14109v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective contrastive knowledge distillation framework that achieves sample-wise logit alignment while preserving semantic consistency. Conventional knowledge distillation approaches exhibit over-reliance on feature similarity per sample, which risks overfitting, and contrastive approaches focus on inter-class discrimination at the expense of intra-sample semantic relationships. Our approach transfers "dark knowledge" through teacher-student contrastive alignment at the sample level. Specifically, our method first enforces intra-sample alignment by directly minimizing teacher-student logit discrepancies within individual samples. Then, we utilize inter-sample contrasts to preserve semantic dissimilarities across samples. By redefining positive pairs as aligned teacher-student logits from identical samples and negative pairs as cross-sample logit combinations, we reformulate these dual constraints into an InfoNCE loss framework, reducing computational complexity lower than sample squares while eliminating dependencies on temperature parameters and large batch sizes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across three benchmark datasets, including the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and MS COCO datasets, and experimental results clearly confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MATT-GS: Masked Attention-based 3DGS for Robot Perception and Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19330v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel masked attention-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approach to enhance robotic perception and object detection in industrial and smart factory environments. U2-Net is employed for background removal to isolate target objects from raw images, thereby minimizing clutter and ensuring that the model processes only relevant data. Additionally, a Sobel filter-based attention mechanism is integrated into the 3DGS framework to enhance fine details - capturing critical features such as screws, wires, and intricate textures essential for high-precision tasks. We validate our approach using quantitative metrics, including L1 loss, SSIM, PSNR, comparing the performance of the background-removed and attention-incorporated 3DGS model against the ground truth images and the original 3DGS training baseline. The results demonstrate significant improves in visual fidelity and detail preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in enhancing robotic vision for object recognition and manipulation in complex industrial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[Frequency Dynamic Convolution for Dense Image Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18783v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Dynamic Convolution (DY-Conv) has shown promising performance by enabling adaptive weight selection through multiple parallel weights combined with an attention mechanism, the frequency response of these weights tends to exhibit high similarity, resulting in high parameter costs but limited adaptability. In this work, we introduce Frequency Dynamic Convolution (FDConv), a novel approach that mitigates these limitations by learning a fixed parameter budget in the Fourier domain. FDConv divides this budget into frequency-based groups with disjoint Fourier indices, enabling the construction of frequency-diverse weights without increasing the parameter cost. To further enhance adaptability, we propose Kernel Spatial Modulation (KSM) and Frequency Band Modulation (FBM). KSM dynamically adjusts the frequency response of each filter at the spatial level, while FBM decomposes weights into distinct frequency bands in the frequency domain and modulates them dynamically based on local content. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, and classification validate the effectiveness of FDConv. We demonstrate that when applied to ResNet-50, FDConv achieves superior performance with a modest increase of +3.6M parameters, outperforming previous methods that require substantial increases in parameter budgets (e.g., CondConv +90M, KW +76.5M). Moreover, FDConv seamlessly integrates into a variety of architectures, including ConvNeXt, Swin-Transformer, offering a flexible and efficient solution for modern vision tasks.

| **[Multiscale Feature Importance-based Bit Allocation for End-to-End Feature Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19278v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) aims to compress intermediate features effectively for remote intelligent analytics, which is crucial for future intelligent visual applications. In this paper, we propose a Multiscale Feature Importance-based Bit Allocation (MFIBA) for end-to-end FCM. First, we find that the importance of features for machine vision tasks varies with the scales, object size, and image instances. Based on this finding, we propose a Multiscale Feature Importance Prediction (MFIP) module to predict the importance weight for each scale of features. Secondly, we propose a task loss-rate model to establish the relationship between the task accuracy losses of using compressed features and the bitrate of encoding these features. Finally, we develop a MFIBA for end-to-end FCM, which is able to assign coding bits of multiscale features more reasonably based on their importance. Experimental results demonstrate that when combined with a retained Efficient Learned Image Compression (ELIC), the proposed MFIBA achieves an average of 38.202% bitrate savings in object detection compared to the anchor ELIC. Moreover, the proposed MFIBA achieves an average of 17.212% and 36.492% feature bitrate savings for instance segmentation and keypoint detection, respectively. When the proposed MFIBA is applied to the LIC-TCM, it achieves an average of 18.103%, 19.866% and 19.597% bit rate savings on three machine vision tasks, respectively, which validates the proposed MFIBA has good generalizability and adaptability to different machine vision tasks and FCM base codecs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking Object Detectors under Real-World Distribution Shifts in Satellite Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19202v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detectors have achieved remarkable performance in many applications; however, these deep learning models are typically designed under the i.i.d. assumption, meaning they are trained and evaluated on data sampled from the same (source) distribution. In real-world deployment, however, target distributions often differ from source data, leading to substantial performance degradation. Domain Generalisation (DG) seeks to bridge this gap by enabling models to generalise to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data without access to target distributions during training, enhancing robustness to unseen conditions. In this work, we examine the generalisability and robustness of state-of-the-art object detectors under real-world distribution shifts, focusing particularly on spatial domain shifts. Despite the need, a standardised benchmark dataset specifically designed for assessing object detection under realistic DG scenarios is currently lacking. To address this, we introduce Real-World Distribution Shifts (RWDS), a suite of three novel DG benchmarking datasets that focus on humanitarian and climate change applications. These datasets enable the investigation of domain shifts across (i) climate zones and (ii) various disasters and geographic regions. To our knowledge, these are the first DG benchmarking datasets tailored for object detection in real-world, high-impact contexts. We aim for these datasets to serve as valuable resources for evaluating the robustness and generalisation of future object detection models.

| **[BEVDiffuser: Plug-and-Play Diffusion Model for BEV Denoising with Ground-Truth Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19694v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations play a crucial role in autonomous driving tasks. Despite recent advancements in BEV generation, inherent noise, stemming from sensor limitations and the learning process, remains largely unaddressed, resulting in suboptimal BEV representations that adversely impact the performance of downstream tasks. To address this, we propose BEVDiffuser, a novel diffusion model that effectively denoises BEV feature maps using the ground-truth object layout as guidance. BEVDiffuser can be operated in a plug-and-play manner during training time to enhance existing BEV models without requiring any architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate BEVDiffuser's exceptional denoising and generation capabilities, which enable significant enhancement to existing BEV models, as evidenced by notable improvements of 12.3\% in mAP and 10.1\% in NDS achieved for 3D object detection without introducing additional computational complexity. Moreover, substantial improvements in long-tail object detection and under challenging weather and lighting conditions further validate BEVDiffuser's effectiveness in denoising and enhancing BEV representations.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |
| **[Pitch Contour Exploration Across Audio Domains: A Vision-Based Transfer Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19161v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines pitch contours as a unifying semantic construct prevalent across various audio domains including music, speech, bioacoustics, and everyday sounds. Analyzing pitch contours offers insights into the universal role of pitch in the perceptual processing of audio signals and contributes to a deeper understanding of auditory mechanisms in both humans and animals. Conventional pitch-tracking methods, while optimized for music and speech, face challenges in handling much broader frequency ranges and more rapid pitch variations found in other audio domains. This study introduces a vision-based approach to pitch contour analysis that eliminates the need for explicit pitch-tracking. The approach uses a convolutional neural network, pre-trained for object detection in natural images and fine-tuned with a dataset of synthetically generated pitch contours, to extract key contour parameters from the time-frequency representation of short audio segments. A diverse set of eight downstream tasks from four audio domains were selected to provide a challenging evaluation scenario for cross-domain pitch contour analysis. The results show that the proposed method consistently surpasses traditional techniques based on pitch-tracking on a wide range of tasks. This suggests that the vision-based approach establishes a foundation for comparative studies of pitch contour characteristics across diverse audio domains.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach integrates trajectory planning with real-time control through a combination of the A* algorithm for global path planning and NMPC for local control, enhancing trajectory adaptability and obstacle avoidance. We propose an advanced event-triggered control system that updates based on events identified through dynamically generated environmental maps. These maps are constructed using a dual-camera setup, which includes multi-camera systems for static obstacle detection and event cameras for high-resolution, low-latency detection of dynamic obstacles. This design is crucial for addressing fast-moving and transient obstacles that conventional cameras may overlook, particularly in environments with rapid motion and variable lighting conditions. When new obstacles are detected, the A* algorithm recalculates waypoints based on the updated map, ensuring safe and efficient navigation. This real-time obstacle detection and map updating integration allows the system to adaptively respond to environmental changes, markedly improving safety and navigation efficiency. The system employs SLAM and object detection techniques utilizing data from multi-cameras, event cameras, and IMUs for accurate localization and comprehensive environmental mapping. The NMPC framework adeptly manages the complex dynamics of multiple quadrotors and suspended payloads, incorporating safety constraints to maintain dynamic feasibility and stability. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach, demonstrating significant enhancements in energy efficiency, computational resource management, and responsiveness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Building Blocks for Robust and Effective Semi-Supervised Real-World Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18903v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) based on pseudo-labeling significantly reduces dependence on large labeled datasets by effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. However, real-world applications of SSOD often face critical challenges, including class imbalance, label noise, and labeling errors. We present an in-depth analysis of SSOD under real-world conditions, uncovering causes of suboptimal pseudo-labeling and key trade-offs between label quality and quantity. Based on our findings, we propose four building blocks that can be seamlessly integrated into an SSOD framework. Rare Class Collage (RCC): a data augmentation method that enhances the representation of rare classes by creating collages of rare objects. Rare Class Focus (RCF): a stratified batch sampling strategy that ensures a more balanced representation of all classes during training. Ground Truth Label Correction (GLC): a label refinement method that identifies and corrects false, missing, and noisy ground truth labels by leveraging the consistency of teacher model predictions. Pseudo-Label Selection (PLS): a selection method for removing low-quality pseudo-labeled images, guided by a novel metric estimating the missing detection rate while accounting for class rarity. We validate our methods through comprehensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets, resulting in up to 6% increase in SSOD performance. Overall, our investigation and novel, data-centric, and broadly applicable building blocks enable robust and effective SSOD in complex, real-world scenarios.

The Radar-Camera fusion in outdoor 3D scene perception is capped by the image-to-BEV transformation--if the depth of pixels is not accurately estimated, the naive combination of BEV features actually integrates unaligned visual content. To avoid this problem, we propose a query-based framework that enables adaptive sampling of instance-relevant features from both the bird's-eye view (BEV) and the original image view. Furthermore, we enhance system performance by two key designs: optimizing query initialization and strengthening the representational capacity of BEV. For the former, we introduce an adaptive circular distribution in polar coordinates to refine the initialization of object queries, allowing for a distance-based adjustment of query density. For the latter, we initially incorporate a radar-guided depth head to refine the transformation from image view to BEV. Subsequently, we focus on leveraging the Doppler effect of radar and introduce an implicit dynamic catcher to capture the temporal elements within the BEV. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and View-of-Delft (VoD) datasets validate the merits of our design. Remarkably, our method achieves superior results of 64.9% mAP and 70.2% NDS on nuScenes. RaCFormer also secures the state-of-the-art performance on the VoD dataset.

However, most of the existing object detectors used in drones are not end-to-end and require the design of various complex components and careful fine-tuning. Most of the existing end-to-end object detectors are designed for natural scenes. It is not ideal to apply them directly to UAV images. In order to solve the above challenges, we design an local-global information interaction DETR for UAVs, namely LGI-DETR. Cross-layer bidirectional low-level and high-level feature information enhancement, this fusion method is effective especially in the field of small objection detection. At the initial stage of encoder, we propose a local spatial enhancement module (LSE), which enhances the low-level rich local spatial information into the high-level feature, and reduces the loss of local information in the transmission process of high-level information. At the final stage of the encoder, we propose a novel global information injection module (GII) designed to integrate rich high-level global semantic representations with low-level feature maps. This hierarchical fusion mechanism effectively addresses the inherent limitations of local receptive fields by propagating contextual information across the feature hierarchy. Experimental results on two challenging UAV image object detection benchmarks, VisDrone2019 and UAVDT, show that our proposed model outperforms the SOTA model. Compared to the baseline model, AP and AP50 improved by 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |
| **[Multiple Object Tracking as ID Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16848v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has been a long-standing challenge in video understanding. A natural and intuitive approach is to split this task into two parts: object detection and association. Most mainstream methods employ meticulously crafted heuristic techniques to maintain trajectory information and compute cost matrices for object matching. Although these methods can achieve notable tracking performance, they often require a series of elaborate handcrafted modifications while facing complicated scenarios. We believe that manually assumed priors limit the method's adaptability and flexibility in learning optimal tracking capabilities from domain-specific data. Therefore, we introduce a new perspective that treats Multiple Object Tracking as an in-context ID Prediction task, transforming the aforementioned object association into an end-to-end trainable task. Based on this, we propose a simple yet effective method termed MOTIP. Given a set of trajectories carried with ID information, MOTIP directly decodes the ID labels for current detections to accomplish the association process. Without using tailored or sophisticated architectures, our method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks by solely leveraging object-level features as tracking cues. The simplicity and impressive results of MOTIP leave substantial room for future advancements, thereby making it a promising baseline for subsequent research.

However, existing depth-assisted solutions still exhibit inferior performance, whose reason is universally acknowledged as the unsatisfactory accuracy of monocular depth estimation models. In this paper, we revisit monocular 3D object detection from the depth perspective and formulate an additional issue as the limited 3D structure-aware capability of existing depth representations (e.g., depth one-hot encoding or depth distribution). To address this issue, we introduce a novel Depth Thickness Field approach to embed clear 3D structures of the scenes. Specifically, we present MonoDTF, a scene-to-instance depth-adapted network for monocular 3D object detection. The framework mainly comprises a Scene-Level Depth Retargeting (SDR) module and an Instance-Level Spatial Refinement (ISR) module. The former retargets traditional depth representations to the proposed depth thickness field, incorporating the scene-level perception of 3D structures. The latter refines the voxel space with the guidance of instances, enhancing the 3D instance-aware capability of the depth thickness field and thus improving detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate our superiority to existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods and the universality when equipped with different depth estimation models.

Instead, performing distillation at finer granularity is conducive to uncovering local details supplementary to global knowledge transfer and reconstructing comprehensive student features. In this study, we propose a Spatial-aware Adaptive Masking Knowledge Distillation (SAMKD) framework for accurate object detection. Different from previous feature distillation methods which mainly perform single-scale feature masking, we develop spatially hierarchical feature masking distillation scheme, such that the object-aware locality is encoded during coarse-to-fine distillation process for improved feature reconstruction. In addition, our spatial-aware feature distillation strategy is combined with a masking logit distillation scheme in which region-specific feature difference between teacher and student networks is utilized to adaptively guide the distillation process. Thus, it can help the student model to better learn from the teacher counterpart with improved knowledge transfer and reduced gap. Extensive experiments for detection task demonstrate the superiority of our method. For example, when FCOS is used as teacher detector with ResNet101 backbone, our method improves the student network from 35.3\% to 38.8\% mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art distillation methods including MGD, FreeKD and DMKD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Objects to Events: Unlocking Complex Visual Understanding in Object Detectors via LLM-guided Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05843v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our key innovation lies in bridging the semantic gap between object detection and event understanding without requiring expensive task-specific training. The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%). The code will be released soon.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Task-driven Image Fusion with Learnable Fusion Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03240v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal image fusion aggregates information from multiple sensor sources, achieving superior visual quality and perceptual features compared to single-source images, often improving downstream tasks. However, current fusion methods for downstream tasks still use predefined fusion objectives that potentially mismatch the downstream tasks, limiting adaptive guidance and reducing model flexibility. To address this, we propose Task-driven Image Fusion (TDFusion), a fusion framework incorporating a learnable fusion loss guided by task loss. Specifically, our fusion loss includes learnable parameters modeled by a neural network called the loss generation module. This module is supervised by the downstream task loss in a meta-learning manner. The learning objective is to minimize the task loss of fused images after optimizing the fusion module with the fusion loss. Iterative updates between the fusion module and the loss module ensure that the fusion network evolves toward minimizing task loss, guiding the fusion process toward the task objectives. TDFusion's training relies entirely on the downstream task loss, making it adaptable to any specific task. It can be applied to any architecture of fusion and task networks. Experiments demonstrate TDFusion's performance through fusion experiments conducted on four different datasets, in addition to evaluations on semantic segmentation and object detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Fractal Calibration for long-tailed object detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11774v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world datasets follow an imbalanced distribution, which poses significant challenges in rare-category object detection. Recent studies tackle this problem by developing re-weighting and re-sampling methods, that utilise the class frequencies of the dataset. However, these techniques focus solely on the frequency statistics and ignore the distribution of the classes in image space, missing important information. In contrast to them, we propose FRActal CALibration (FRACAL): a novel post-calibration method for long-tailed object detection. FRACAL devises a logit adjustment method that utilises the fractal dimension to estimate how uniformly classes are distributed in image space. During inference, it uses the fractal dimension to inversely downweight the probabilities of uniformly spaced class predictions achieving balance in two axes: between frequent and rare categories, and between uniformly spaced and sparsely spaced classes. FRACAL is a post-processing method and it does not require any training, also it can be combined with many off-the-shelf models such as one-stage sigmoid detectors and two-stage instance segmentation models. FRACAL boosts the rare class performance by up to 8.6% and surpasses all previous methods on LVIS dataset, while showing good generalisation to other datasets such as COCO, V3Det and OpenImages.

In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ROLISP (Risk Object Localization and Intention and Suggestion Prediction), which towards interpretable risk object detection and suggestion for ego car motions. Accurate ROLISP implementation requires extensive reasoning to identify critical traffic objects and infer their intentions, prompting us to explore the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, the limited perception performance of CLIP-ViT vision encoders in existing MLLMs struggles with capturing essential visual perception information, e.g., high-resolution, multi-scale and visual-related inductive biases, which are important for autonomous driving. Addressing these challenges, we introduce HiLM-D, a resource-efficient framework that enhances visual information processing in MLLMs for ROLISP. Our method is motivated by the fact that the primary variations in autonomous driving scenarios are the motion trajectories rather than the semantic or appearance information (e.g., the shapes and colors) of objects. Hence, the visual process of HiLM-D is a two-stream framework: (i) a temporal reasoning stream, receiving low-resolution dynamic video content, to capture temporal semantics, and (ii) a spatial perception stream, receiving a single high-resolution frame, to capture holistic visual perception-related information. The spatial perception stream can be made very lightweight by a well-designed P-Adapter, which is lightweight, training-efficient, and easily integrated into existing MLLMs. Experiments on the DRAMA-ROLISP dataset show HiLM-D's significant improvements over current MLLMs, with a 3.7% in BLEU-4 for captioning and 8.7% in mIoU for detection.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV | None |
| **[MMO-IG: Multi-Class and Multi-Scale Object Image Generation for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13684v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of deep generative models (DGMs) has significantly advanced research in computer vision, providing a cost-effective alternative to acquiring vast quantities of expensive imagery. However, existing methods predominantly focus on synthesizing remote sensing (RS) images aligned with real images in a global layout view, which limits their applicability in RS image object detection (RSIOD) research. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-class and multi-scale object image generator based on DGMs, termed MMO-IG, designed to generate RS images with supervised object labels from global and local aspects simultaneously. Specifically, from the local view, MMO-IG encodes various RS instances using an iso-spacing instance map (ISIM). During the generation process, it decodes each instance region with iso-spacing value in ISIM-corresponding to both background and foreground instances-to produce RS images through the denoising process of diffusion models. Considering the complex interdependencies among MMOs, we construct a spatial-cross dependency knowledge graph (SCDKG). This ensures a realistic and reliable multidirectional distribution among MMOs for region embedding, thereby reducing the discrepancy between source and target domains. Besides, we propose a structured object distribution instruction (SODI) to guide the generation of synthesized RS image content from a global aspect with SCDKG-based ISIM together. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MMO-IG exhibits superior generation capabilities for RS images with dense MMO-supervised labels, and RS detectors pre-trained with MMO-IG show excellent performance on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Our previous work on detecting polyps within colonoscopy provided an efficient end-to-end solution to alleviate doctor's examination overhead. However, our later experiments found this framework is not as robust as before as the condition of polyp capturing varies. In this work, we conducted several studies on data set, identifying main issues that causes low precision rate in the task of polyp detection. We used an optimized anchor generation methods to get better anchor box shape and more boxes are used for detection as we believe this is necessary for small object detection. An alternative backbone is used to compensate the heavy time cost introduced by dense anchor box regression. With use of the attention gate module, our model can achieve state-of-the-art polyp detection performance while still maintain real-time detection speed.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Efficient Self-supervised Vision Pretraining with Local Masked Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00790v3)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning for computer vision has achieved tremendous progress and improved many downstream vision tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Among these, generative self-supervised vision learning approaches such as MAE and BEiT show promising performance. However, their global masked reconstruction mechanism is computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose local masked reconstruction (LoMaR), a simple yet effective approach that performs masked reconstruction within a small window of 7$\times$7 patches on a simple Transformer encoder, improving the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy compared to global masked reconstruction over the entire image. Extensive experiments show that LoMaR reaches 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming MAE by 0.5%. After finetuning the pretrained LoMaR on 384$\times$384 images, it can reach 85.4% top-1 accuracy, surpassing MAE by 0.6%. On MS COCO, LoMaR outperforms MAE by 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{box}$ on object detection and 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{mask}$ on instance segmentation. LoMaR is especially more computation-efficient on pretraining high-resolution images, e.g., it is 3.1$\times$ faster than MAE with 0.2% higher classification accuracy on pretraining 448$\times$448 images. This local masked reconstruction learning mechanism can be easily integrated into any other generative self-supervised learning approach.

We first assemble a large-scale dataset, called R2C7K, which consists of 7K images covering 64 object categories in real-world scenarios. Then, we develop a simple but strong dual-branch framework, dubbed R2CNet, with a reference branch embedding the common representations of target objects from referring images and a segmentation branch identifying and segmenting camouflaged objects under the guidance of the common representations. In particular, we design a Referring Mask Generation module to generate pixel-level prior mask and a Referring Feature Enrichment module to enhance the capability of identifying specified camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our Ref-COD methods over their COD counterparts in segmenting specified camouflaged objects and identifying the main body of target objects.

However, traditional active learning approaches solely rely on a small amount of labeled data to train an initial model for data selection, overlooking the potential of leveraging the abundance of unlabeled data. Recently, attempts to integrate semi-supervised learning (SSL) into AL with the goal of leveraging unlabeled data have faced challenges in effectively resolving the conflict between the two paradigms, resulting in less satisfactory performance. To tackle this conflict, we propose a Synergistic Semi-Supervised Active Learning framework, dubbed as S-SSAL. Specifically, from the perspective of SSL, we propose a Collaborative PseudoScene Pre-training (CPSP) method that effectively learns from unlabeled data without introducing adverse effects. From the perspective of AL, we design a Collaborative Active Learning (CAL) method, which complements the uncertainty and diversity methods by model cascading. This allows us to fully exploit the potential of the CPSP pre-trained model. Extensive experiments conducted on KITTI and Waymo demonstrate the effectiveness of our S-SSAL framework. Notably, on the KITTI dataset, utilizing only 2% labeled data, S-SSAL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on the full dataset.

However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30\% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

In this paper, we introduce a novel Mamba-based method, the 3D Mamba-Based Atmospheric Turbulence Removal (MAMAT), which employs a dual-module strategy to mitigate these distortions. The first module utilizes deformable 3D convolutions for non-rigid registration to minimize spatial shifts, while the second module enhances contrast and detail. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of the 3D Mamba architecture, experimental results demonstrate that MAMAT outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based methods, achieving up to a 3\% improvement in visual quality and a 15\% boost in object detection. It not only enhances visualization but also significantly improves object detection accuracy, bridging the gap between visual restoration and the effectiveness of surveillance applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Federated learning (FL) serves as a promising paradigm to enable autonomous vehicles to train models collaboratively with their onboard computing resources. However, existing vehicle selection schemes for FL all assume predetermined and location-independent vehicles' datasets, neglecting the fact that vehicles collect training data along their routes, thereby resulting in suboptimal vehicle selection. To improve the perception quality in AD for a region, we propose Sense4FL, a vehicular crowdsensing-enhanced FL framework featuring trajectory-dependent vehicular training data collection. To this end, we first derive the convergence bound of FL by considering the impact of both vehicles' uncertain trajectories and uploading probabilities, from which we discover that minimizing the training loss is equivalent to minimizing a weighted sum of local and global earth mover's distance (EMD) between vehicles' collected data distribution and global data distribution. Based on this observation, we formulate the trajectory-dependent vehicle selection and data collection problem for FL in AD. Given that the problem is NP-hard, we develop an efficient algorithm to find the solution with an approximation guarantee. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in improving object detection performance compared with existing benchmarks.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures | None |

Two prominent approaches in SSL include contrastive-based learning and self-distillation utilizing cropping augmentation. Lately, masked image modeling (MIM) has emerged as a more potent SSL technique, employing image inpainting as a pretext task. MIM creates a strong inductive bias toward meaningful spatial and semantic understanding. This has opened up new opportunities for SSL to contribute not only to classification tasks but also to more complex applications like object detection and image segmentation. Building upon this progress, our research paper introduces a scalable and practical SSL approach centered around more challenging pretext tasks that facilitate the acquisition of robust features. Specifically, we leverage multi-scale image reconstruction from randomly masked input images as the foundation for feature learning. Our hypothesis posits that reconstructing high-resolution images enables the model to attend to finer spatial details, particularly beneficial for discerning subtle intricacies within medical images. The proposed SSL features help improve classification performance on the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) dataset. In pathology classification, our method demonstrates a 3\% increase in average precision (AP) and a 1\% increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Moreover, in mass margins classification, our approach achieves a 4\% increase in AP and a 2\% increase in AUC.</p></details> |  | None |

This conventional approach, however, overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both the encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon: a framework-agnostic adaptation to convert an encoder-only self-supervised learning (SSL) contrastive approach to an efficient encoder-decoder framework that can be pre-trained in a contrastive manner. We first update the existing architecture to accommodate a decoder and its respective contrastive loss. We then introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives that facilitates the joint encoder-decoder architecture pre-training. We adapt two established contrastive SSL frameworks tailored for dense prediction tasks, achieve new state-of-the-art results in COCO object detection and instance segmentation, and match state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. We show that our approach allows for pre-training a decoder and enhances the representation power of the encoder and its performance in dense prediction tasks. This benefit holds across heterogeneous decoder architectures between pre-training and fine-tuning and persists in out-of-domain, limited-data scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Event-Based Crossing Dataset (EBCD)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17499v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based vision revolutionizes traditional image sensing by capturing asynchronous intensity variations rather than static frames, enabling ultrafast temporal resolution, sparse data encoding, and enhanced motion perception. While this paradigm offers significant advantages, conventional event-based datasets impose a fixed thresholding constraint to determine pixel activations, severely limiting adaptability to real-world environmental fluctuations. Lower thresholds retain finer details but introduce pervasive noise, whereas higher thresholds suppress extraneous activations at the expense of crucial object information. To mitigate these constraints, we introduce the Event-Based Crossing Dataset (EBCD), a comprehensive dataset tailored for pedestrian and vehicle detection in dynamic outdoor environments, incorporating a multi-thresholding framework to refine event representations. By capturing event-based images at ten distinct threshold levels (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 75), this dataset facilitates an extensive assessment of object detection performance under varying conditions of sparsity and noise suppression. We benchmark state-of-the-art detection architectures-including YOLOv4, YOLOv7, EfficientDet-b0, MobileNet-v1, and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)-to experiment upon the nuanced impact of threshold selection on detection performance. By offering a systematic approach to threshold variation, we foresee that EBCD fosters a more adaptive evaluation of event-based object detection, aligning diverse neuromorphic vision with real-world scene dynamics.

Our AnytimeYOLO networks allow for interruptible inference, i.e., they provide a prediction at any point in time, a property desirable for safety-critical real-time applications. We present structured explorations to modify the YOLO architecture, enabling early termination to obtain intermediate results. We focus on providing fine-grained control through high granularity of available termination points. First, we formalize Anytime Models as a special class of prediction models that offer anytime predictions. Then, we discuss a novel transposed variant of the YOLO architecture, that changes the architecture to enable better early predictions and greater freedom for the order of processing stages. Finally, we propose two optimization algorithms that, given an anytime model, can be used to determine the optimal exit execution order and the optimal subset of early-exits to select for deployment in low-resource environments. We evaluate the anytime performance and trade-offs of design choices, proposing a new anytime quality metric for this purpose. In particular, we also discuss key challenges for anytime inference that currently make its deployment costly.</p></details> |  | None |

Current state-of-the-art methods operate by classifying on video sub-volumes (tubelets), but they often lose global spatial context by focusing only on local regions within detection ROIs. Here we propose a lightweight framework for tubelet-based object detection and video classification that preserves both global spatial context and fine spatiotemporal features. To address the loss of global context, we embed tubelet location, size, and confidence as inputs to the classifier. Additionally, we use ROI-aligned feature maps from a pre-trained detection model, leveraging learned feature representations to increase the receptive field and reduce computational complexity. Our method is efficient, with the spatiotemporal tubelet classifier comprising only 0.4M parameters. We apply our approach to detect and classify lung consolidation and pleural effusion in ultrasound videos. Five-fold cross-validation on 14,804 videos from 828 patients shows our method outperforms previous tubelet-based approaches and is suited for real-time workflows.</p></details> | ISBI Oral 2025 | None |

As 3D object detection systems (OD) can interpret such point cloud data, they play a key role in the driving decisions of autonomous vehicles. Consequently, such 3D OD must be robust against all types of perturbations and must therefore be extensively tested. One approach is the use of adversarial examples, which are small, sometimes sophisticated perturbations in the input data that change, i.e., falsify, the prediction of the OD. These perturbations are carefully designed based on the weaknesses of the OD. The robustness of the OD cannot be quantified with adversarial examples in general, because if the OD is vulnerable to a given attack, it is unclear whether this is due to the robustness of the OD or whether the attack algorithm produces particularly strong adversarial examples. The contribution of this work is Hi-ALPS -- Hierarchical Adversarial-example-based LiDAR Perturbation Level System, where higher robustness of the OD is required to withstand the perturbations as the perturbation levels increase. In doing so, the Hi-ALPS levels successively implement a heuristic followed by established adversarial example approaches. In a series of comprehensive experiments using Hi-ALPS, we quantify the robustness of six state-of-the-art 3D OD under different types of perturbations. The results of the experiments show that none of the OD is robust against all Hi-ALPS levels; an important factor for the ranking is that human observers can still correctly recognize the perturbed objects, as the respective perturbations are small. To increase the robustness of the OD, we discuss the applicability of state-of-the-art countermeasures. In addition, we derive further suggestions for countermeasures based on our experimental results.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models has shown promising results in the context of DG problem. Nevertheless, existing PEFT methods still struggle to strike a balance between preserving generalizable components of the pre-trained model and learning task-specific features. To gain insights into the distribution of generalizable components, we begin by analyzing the pre-trained weights through the lens of singular value decomposition. Building on these insights, we introduce Singular Value Decomposed Minor Components Adaptation (SoMA), an approach that selectively tunes minor singular components while keeping the residual parts frozen. SoMA effectively retains the generalization ability of the pre-trained model while efficiently acquiring task-specific skills. Moreover, we freeze domain-generalizable blocks and employ an annealing weight decay strategy, thereby achieving an optimal balance in the delicate trade-off between generalizability and discriminability. SoMA attains state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks that span both domain generalized semantic segmentation to domain generalized object detection. In addition, our methods introduce no additional inference overhead or regularization loss, maintain compatibility with any backbone or head, and are designed to be versatile, allowing easy integration into a wide range of tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Project page: https://ysj9909.github.io/SoRA.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ysj9909.github.io/SoRA.github.io) |

Variations in cell counts may indicate the presence of pathological conditions. Thus, the significance of developing precise automatic systems for blood cell enumeration is underscored. The investigation focuses on a novel approach termed DE-ViT. This methodology is employed in a Few-Shot paradigm, wherein training relies on a limited number of images. Two distinct datasets are utilised for experimental purposes: the Raabin-WBC dataset for Leukocyte detection and a local dataset for Schistocyte identification. In addition to the DE-ViT model, two baseline models, Faster R-CNN 50 and Faster R-CNN X 101, are employed, with their outcomes being compared against those of the proposed model. While DE-ViT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the COCO and LVIS datasets, both baseline models surpassed its performance on the Raabin-WBC dataset. Moreover, only Faster R-CNN X 101 yielded satisfactory results on the SC-IDB. The observed disparities in performance may possibly be attributed to domain shift phenomena.</p></details> |  | None |

Instead of utilizing range images or bird's eye view (BEV) images, we represent both LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds using voxel features, which more effectively capture 3D shape information. Subsequently, we propose the Latent Voxel Diffusion Model (LVDM), which performs the diffusion process in the latent space. Additionally, a novel Latent Point Cloud Reconstruction (LPCR) module is utilized to reconstruct point clouds from high-dimensional latent voxel features. As a result, R2LDM effectively generates LiDAR-like point clouds from paired raw radar data. We evaluate our approach on two different datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves 6- to 10-fold densification of radar point clouds, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in 4D radar point cloud super-resolution. Furthermore, the enhanced radar point clouds generated by our method significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving up to 31.7% improvement in point cloud registration recall rate and 24.9% improvement in object detection accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Superpowering Open-Vocabulary Object Detectors for X-ray Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17071v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary object detection (OvOD) is set to revolutionize security screening by enabling systems to recognize any item in X-ray scans. However, developing effective OvOD models for X-ray imaging presents unique challenges due to data scarcity and the modality gap that prevents direct adoption of RGB-based solutions. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAXO, a training-free framework that repurposes off-the-shelf RGB OvOD detectors for robust X-ray detection. RAXO builds high-quality X-ray class descriptors using a dual-source retrieval strategy. It gathers relevant RGB images from the web and enriches them via a novel X-ray material transfer mechanism, eliminating the need for labeled databases. These visual descriptors replace text-based classification in OvOD, leveraging intra-modal feature distances for robust detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAXO consistently improves OvOD performance, providing an average mAP increase of up to 17.0 points over base detectors. To further support research in this emerging field, we also introduce DET-COMPASS, a new benchmark featuring bounding box annotations for over 300 object categories, enabling large-scale evaluation of OvOD in X-ray.

Existing vision models often struggle in such scenarios due to the indistinguishable appearance of camouflaged objects and the insufficient exploitation of dynamic information in videos. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end VCOD framework inspired by human memory-recognition, which leverages historical video information by integrating memory reference frames for camouflaged sequence processing. Specifically, we design a dual-purpose decoder that simultaneously generates predicted masks and scores, enabling reference frame selection based on scores while introducing auxiliary supervision to enhance feature extraction.Furthermore, this study introduces a novel reference-guided multilevel asymmetric attention mechanism, effectively integrating long-term reference information with short-term motion cues for comprehensive feature extraction. By combining these modules, we develop the Scoring, Remember, and Reference (SRR) framework, which efficiently extracts information to locate targets and employs memory guidance to improve subsequent processing. With its optimized module design and effective utilization of video data, our model achieves significant performance improvements, surpassing existing approaches by 10% on benchmark datasets while requiring fewer parameters (54M) and only a single pass through the video. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

The paper is concerned with the challenge of consistent assemblages of archaeological data. We cannot simply combine existing records, as they differ in terms of quality and recording standards. Thus, records have to be recreated from published archaeological illustrations. This is only a viable path with the help of automation. The contribution of this paper is a new workflow for collecting data from archaeological find catalogues available as legacy resources, such as archaeological drawings and photographs in large unsorted PDF files; the workflow relies on custom software (AutArch) supporting image processing, object detection, and interactive means of validating and adjusting automatically retrieved data. We integrate artificial intelligence (AI) in terms of neural networks for object detection and classification into the workflow, thereby speeding up, automating, and standardising data collection. Objects commonly found in archaeological catalogues - such as graves, skeletons, ceramics, ornaments, stone tools and maps - are detected. Those objects are spatially related and analysed to extract real-life attributes, such as the size and orientation of graves based on the north arrow and the scale. We also automate recording of geometric whole-outlines through contour detection, as an alternative to landmark-based geometric morphometrics. Detected objects, contours, and other automatically retrieved data can be manually validated and adjusted. We use third millennium BC Europe (encompassing cultures such as 'Corded Ware' and 'Bell Beaker', and their burial practices) as a 'testing ground' and for evaluation purposes; this includes a user study for the workflow and the AutArch software.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Salient Object Detection in Traffic Scene through the TSOD10K Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16910v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Salient Object Detection (TSOD) aims to segment the objects critical to driving safety by combining semantic (e.g., collision risks) and visual saliency. Unlike SOD in natural scene images (NSI-SOD), which prioritizes visually distinctive regions, TSOD emphasizes the objects that demand immediate driver attention due to their semantic impact, even with low visual contrast. This dual criterion, i.e., bridging perception and contextual risk, re-defines saliency for autonomous and assisted driving systems. To address the lack of task-specific benchmarks, we collect the first large-scale TSOD dataset with pixel-wise saliency annotations, named TSOD10K. TSOD10K covers the diverse object categories in various real-world traffic scenes under various challenging weather/illumination variations (e.g., fog, snowstorms, low-contrast, and low-light). Methodologically, we propose a Mamba-based TSOD model, termed Tramba. Considering the challenge of distinguishing inconspicuous visual information from complex traffic backgrounds, Tramba introduces a novel Dual-Frequency Visual State Space module equipped with shifted window partitioning and dilated scanning to enhance the perception of fine details and global structure by hierarchically decomposing high/low-frequency components. To emphasize critical regions in traffic scenes, we propose a traffic-oriented Helix 2D-Selective-Scan (Helix-SS2D) mechanism that injects driving attention priors while effectively capturing global multi-direction spatial dependencies. We establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating Tramba and 22 existing NSI-SOD models on TSOD10K, demonstrating Tramba's superiority. Our research establishes the first foundation for safety-aware saliency analysis in intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures | None |

Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) provides a solution by leveraging multimodal associations between text prompts and visual features. However, existing OVD methods for remote sensing (RS) images are constrained by small-scale datasets and fail to address the unique challenges of remote sensing interpretation, include oriented object detection and the need for both high precision and real-time performance in diverse scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose OpenRSD, a universal open-prompt RS object detection framework. OpenRSD supports multimodal prompts and integrates multi-task detection heads to balance accuracy and real-time requirements. Additionally, we design a multi-stage training pipeline to enhance the generalization of model. Evaluated on seven public datasets, OpenRSD demonstrates superior performance in oriented and horizontal bounding box detection, with real-time inference capabilities suitable for large-scale RS image analysis. Compared to YOLO-World, OpenRSD exhibits an 8.7\% higher average precision and achieves an inference speed of 20.8 FPS. Codes and models will be released.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[From Open Vocabulary to Open World: Teaching Vision Language Models to Detect Novel Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18207v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional object detection methods operate under the closed-set assumption, where models can only detect a fixed number of objects predefined in the training set. Recent works on open vocabulary object detection (OVD) enable the detection of objects defined by an in-principle unbounded vocabulary, which reduces the cost of training models for specific tasks. However, OVD heavily relies on accurate prompts provided by an ``oracle'', which limits their use in critical applications such as driving scene perception. OVD models tend to misclassify near-out-of-distribution (NOOD) objects that have similar features to known classes, and ignore far-out-of-distribution (FOOD) objects. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that enables OVD models to operate in open world settings, by identifying and incrementally learning previously unseen objects. To detect FOOD objects, we propose Open World Embedding Learning (OWEL) and introduce the concept of Pseudo Unknown Embedding which infers the location of unknown classes in a continuous semantic space based on the information of known classes. We also propose Multi-Scale Contrastive Anchor Learning (MSCAL), which enables the identification of misclassified unknown objects by promoting the intra-class consistency of object embeddings at different scales. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard open world object detection and autonomous driving benchmarks while maintaining its open vocabulary object detection capability.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional detection and segmentation methods supervise their models through bounding box labels and semantic mask labels. However, these two independent labels inherently contain significant redundancy. This paper aims to eliminate the redundancy by supervising 3D object detection using only semantic labels. However, the challenge arises due to the incomplete geometry structure and boundary ambiguity of point-cloud instances, leading to inaccurate pseudo labels and poor detection results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, named Seg2Box. We first introduce a Multi-Frame Multi-Scale Clustering (MFMS-C) module, which leverages the spatio-temporal consistency of point clouds to generate accurate box-level pseudo-labels. Additionally, the Semantic?Guiding Iterative-Mining Self-Training (SGIM-ST) module is proposed to enhance the performance by progressively refining the pseudo-labels and mining the instances without generating pseudo-labels. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes Dataset show that our method significantly outperforms other competitive methods by 23.7\% and 10.3\% in mAP, respectively. The results demonstrate the great label-efficient potential and advancement of our method.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

Due to the limited resources in MEC, effective resource management is crucial for improving system performance. While existing studies mostly focus on the job offloading problem and assume that job resource demands are fixed and given apriori, the joint consideration of job offloading (selecting the edge server for each job) and resource allocation (determining the bandwidth and computation resources for offloading and processing) remains underexplored. This paper addresses the joint problem for deadline-constrained jobs in MEC with both communication and computation resource constraints, aiming to maximize the total utility gained from jobs. To tackle this problem, we propose an approximation algorithm, $\mathtt{IDAssign}$, with an approximation bound of $\frac{1}{6}$, and experimentally evaluate the performance of $\mathtt{IDAssign}$ by comparing it to state-of-the-art heuristics using a real-world taxi trace and object detection applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 4th Real-time And intelliGent Edge computing workshop, hold on May 6th, 2025 in Irvine, CA, USA</p></details> | None |

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained particular interest due to their promise to reduce energy consumption using event-based processing. We assert that while sigma-delta encoding in SNNs can take advantage of the temporal redundancy across video frames, they still involve a significant amount of redundant computations due to processing insignificant events. In this paper, we propose a region masking strategy that identifies regions of interest at the input of the SNN, thereby eliminating computation and data movement for events arising from unimportant regions. Our approach demonstrates that masking regions at the input not only significantly reduces the overall spiking activity of the network, but also provides significant improvement in throughput and latency. We apply region masking during video object detection on Loihi 2, demonstrating that masking approximately 60% of input regions can reduce energy-delay product by 1.65x over a baseline sigma-delta network, with a degradation in mAP@0.5 by 1.09%.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing FL frameworks struggle to balance privacy, fairness, and robustness, leading to performance disparities across demographic groups. Privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy mitigate data leakage risks but worsen fairness by restricting access to sensitive attributes needed for bias correction. This work explores the trade-off between privacy and fairness in FL-based object detection for AVs and introduces RESFL, an integrated solution optimizing both. RESFL incorporates adversarial privacy disentanglement and uncertainty-guided fairness-aware aggregation. The adversarial component uses a gradient reversal layer to remove sensitive attributes, reducing privacy risks while maintaining fairness. The uncertainty-aware aggregation employs an evidential neural network to weight client updates adaptively, prioritizing contributions with lower fairness disparities and higher confidence. This ensures robust and equitable FL model updates. We evaluate RESFL on the FACET dataset and CARLA simulator, assessing accuracy, fairness, privacy resilience, and robustness under varying conditions. RESFL improves detection accuracy, reduces fairness disparities, and lowers privacy attack success rates while demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial conditions compared to other approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PETS 2025 (under review)</p></details> | None |

Existing unimodal datasets lack scale and diversity, limiting deep learning solutions. This paper proposes MapGlue, a universal MRSI matching framework, and MapData, a large-scale multimodal dataset addressing these gaps. Our contributions are twofold. MapData, a globally diverse dataset spanning 233 sampling points, offers original images (7,000x5,000 to 20,000x15,000 pixels). After rigorous cleaning, it provides 121,781 aligned electronic map-visible image pairs (512x512 pixels) with hybrid manual-automated ground truth, addressing the scarcity of scalable multimodal benchmarks. MapGlue integrates semantic context with a dual graph-guided mechanism to extract cross-modal invariant features. This structure enables global-to-local interaction, enhancing descriptor robustness against modality-specific distortions. Extensive evaluations on MapData and five public datasets demonstrate MapGlue's superiority in matching accuracy under complex conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MapGlue generalizes effectively to unseen modalities without retraining, highlighting its adaptability. This work addresses longstanding challenges in MRSI matching by combining scalable dataset construction with a robust, semantics-driven framework. Furthermore, MapGlue shows strong generalization capabilities on other modality matching tasks for which it was not specifically trained.

However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its application in indoor environments remains unexplored. Compared to outdoor 3D datasets, indoor datasets face significant challenges, including fewer training samples per class, a greater number of classes, more severe class imbalance, and more diverse scene types and intra-class variances. This paper presents the first study on active learning for indoor 3D object detection, where we propose a novel framework tailored for this task. Our method incorporates two key criteria - uncertainty and diversity - to actively select the most ambiguous and informative unlabeled samples for annotation. The uncertainty criterion accounts for both inaccurate detections and undetected objects, ensuring that the most ambiguous samples are prioritized. Meanwhile, the diversity criterion is formulated as a joint optimization problem that maximizes the diversity of both object class distributions and scene types, using a new Class-aware Adaptive Prototype (CAP) bank. The CAP bank dynamically allocates representative prototypes to each class, helping to capture varying intra-class diversity across different categories. We evaluate our method on SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2, where it outperforms baselines by a significant margin, achieving over 85% of fully-supervised performance with just 10% of the annotation budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

These systems often require clear and detailed images for precise object detection and recognition. However, images captured by visual measurement tools frequently suffer from degradation, including blurring and loss of detail, which can impede measurement accuracy.As a potential remedy, we in this paper propose a Semantic-Guided Global-Local Collaborative Network (SGGLC-Net) for lightweight SISR. Our SGGLC-Net leverages semantic priors extracted from a pre-trained model to guide the super-resolution process, enhancing image detail quality effectively. Specifically,we propose a Semantic Guidance Module that seamlessly integrates the semantic priors into the super-resolution network, enabling the network to more adeptly capture and utilize semantic priors, thereby enhancing image details. To further explore both local and non-local interactions for improved detail rendition,we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Module, which features three Global and Local Detail Enhancement Modules, as well as a Hybrid Attention Mechanism to work together to efficiently learn more useful features. Our extensive experiments show that SGGLC-Net achieves competitive PSNR and SSIM values across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating higher performance with the multi-adds reduction of 12.81G compared to state-of-the-art lightweight super-resolution approaches.

While cross-attention has been well-studied in text-to-image tasks, their interpretability in image-to-image (I2I) diffusion models remains underexplored. This paper introduces Image-to-Image Attribution Maps (I2AM), a method that enhances the interpretability of I2I models by visualizing bidirectional attribution maps, from the reference image to the generated image and vice versa. I2AM aggregates cross-attention scores across time steps, attention heads, and layers, offering insights into how critical features are transferred between images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of I2AM across object detection, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our results demonstrate that I2AM successfully identifies key regions responsible for generating the output, even in complex scenes. Additionally, we introduce the Inpainting Mask Attention Consistency Score (IMACS) as a novel evaluation metric to assess the alignment between attribution maps and inpainting masks, which correlates strongly with existing performance metrics. Through extensive experiments, we show that I2AM enables model debugging and refinement, providing practical tools for improving I2I model's performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 23 pages | None |

However, substantial challenges remain in detecting tiny objects, as their features occupy only a very small proportion of the feature maps. Although FPN integrates multi-scale features, it does not directly enhance or enrich the features of tiny objects. Furthermore, FPN lacks spatial perception ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel High Frequency and Spatial Perception Feature Pyramid Network (HS-FPN) with two innovative modules. First, we designed a high frequency perception module (HFP) that generates high frequency responses through high pass filters. These high frequency responses are used as mask weights from both spatial and channel perspectives to enrich and highlight the features of tiny objects in the original feature maps. Second, we developed a spatial dependency perception module (SDP) to capture the spatial dependencies that FPN lacks. Our experiments demonstrate that detectors based on HS-FPN exhibit competitive advantages over state-of-the-art models on the AI-TOD dataset for tiny object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,12 figures,7 tables</p></details> | None |

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) show remarkable performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, very few have been proposed for instance segmentation in vision-based autonomous driving. Moreover, existing methods rely on suboptimal baselines, which severely limits performance. We introduce \textbf{UDA4Inst}, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through \textit{Semantic Category Training} and \textit{Bidirectional Mixing Training}. With the Semantic Category Training method, semantically related classes are grouped and trained separately, enabling the generation of higher-quality pseudo-labels and improved segmentation performance. We further propose a bidirectional cross-domain data mixing strategy that combines instance-wise and patch-wise mixing techniques to effectively utilize data from both source and target domains, producing realistic composite images that improve the model's generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes benchmark with mAP 31.3. Notably, we are the first to report results on multiple novel synth-to-real instance segmentation datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as source domains while Cityscapes and KITTI360 serve as target domains.

However, variations in vision-aware language vocabulary data used for open-vocabulary learning can lead to unfair and unreliable evaluations. Recent evaluation methods have attempted to address this issue by incorporating object properties or adding locations and characteristics to the captions. Nevertheless, since these properties and locations depend on the specific details of the images instead of classes, detectors can not make accurate predictions without precise descriptions provided through human annotation. This paper introduces 3F-OVD, a novel task that extends supervised fine-grained object detection to the open-vocabulary setting. Our task is intuitive and challenging, requiring a deep understanding of Fine-grained captions and careful attention to Fine-grained details in images in order to accurately detect Fine-grained objects. Additionally, due to the scarcity of qualified fine-grained object detection datasets, we have created a new dataset, NEU-171K, tailored for both supervised and open-vocabulary settings. We benchmark state-of-the-art object detectors on our dataset for both settings. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective post-processing technique.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

V2X-R contains 12,079 scenarios with 37,727 frames of LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds, 150,908 images, and 170,859 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline for 3D object detection and implement it with various fusion strategies. To achieve weather-robust detection, we additionally propose a Multi-modal Denoising Diffusion (MDD) module in our fusion pipeline. MDD utilizes weather-robust 4D radar feature as a condition to prompt the diffusion model to denoise noisy LiDAR features. Experiments show that our LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline demonstrates superior performance in the V2X-R dataset. Over and above this, our MDD module further improved the performance of basic fusion model by up to 5.73%/6.70% in foggy/snowy conditions with barely disrupting normal performance.

While these models perform well in the trained clean weather, they struggle in unseen adverse weather conditions with the domain gap. In this paper, we propose a Domain Generalization based approach, named \textit{V2X-DGW}, for LiDAR-based 3D object detection on multi-agent perception system under adverse weather conditions. Our research aims to not only maintain favorable multi-agent performance in the clean weather but also promote the performance in the unseen adverse weather conditions by learning only on the clean weather data. To realize the Domain Generalization, we first introduce the Adaptive Weather Augmentation (AWA) to mimic the unseen adverse weather conditions, and then propose two alignments for generalizable representation learning: Trust-region Weather-invariant Alignment (TWA) and Agent-aware Contrastive Alignment (ACA). To evaluate this research, we add Fog, Rain, Snow conditions on two publicized multi-agent datasets based on physics-based models, resulting in two new datasets: OPV2V-w and V2XSet-w. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our V2X-DGW achieved significant improvements in the unseen adverse weathers.

The YOLOv12n configuration achieved the highest precision at 0.916, the highest recall at 0.969, and the highest mean Average Precision (mAP@50) at 0.978. In comparison, the YOLOv11 series was led by YOLO11x, which achieved the highest precision at 0.857, recall at 0.85, and mAP@50 at 0.91. For the YOLOv10 series, YOLOv10b and YOLOv10l both achieved the highest precision at 0.85, with YOLOv10n achieving the highest recall at 0.8 and mAP@50 at 0.89. These findings demonstrated that YOLOv12, when trained on realistic LLM-generated datasets surpassed its predecessors in key performance metrics. The technique also offered a cost-effective solution by reducing the need for extensive manual data collection in the agricultural field. In addition, this study compared the computational efficiency of all versions of YOLOv12, v11 and v10, where YOLOv11n reported the lowest inference time at 4.7 ms, compared to YOLOv12n's 5.6 ms and YOLOv10n's 5.9 ms. Although YOLOv12 is new and more accurate than YOLOv11, and YOLOv10, YOLO11n still stays the fastest YOLO model among YOLOv10, YOLOv11 and YOLOv12 series of models.

Existing methods achieve certain success by improving knowledge distillation and exemplar replay for transformer-based detection frameworks, but the intrinsic forgetting mechanisms remain underexplored. In this paper, we dive into the cause of forgetting and discover forgetting imbalance between localization and recognition in transformer-based IOD, which means that localization is less-forgetting and can generalize to future classes, whereas catastrophic forgetting occurs primarily on recognition. Based on these insights, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Amnesia (DCA) strategy, which redesigns the transformer-based IOD into a localization-then-recognition process. DCA can well maintain and transfer the localization ability, leaving decoupled fragile recognition to be specially conquered. To reduce feature drift in recognition, we leverage semantic knowledge encoded in pre-trained language models to anchor class representations within a unified feature space across incremental tasks. This involves designing a duplex classifier fusion and embedding class semantic features into the recognition decoding process in the form of queries. Extensive experiments validate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially for long-term incremental scenarios. For example, under the four-step setting on MS-COCO, our DCA strategy significantly improves the final AP by 6.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Test-Time Backdoor Detection for Object Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15293v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers poison a small subset of training samples by embedding a predefined trigger to manipulate prediction. Detecting poisoned samples (i.e., those containing triggers) at test time can prevent backdoor activation. However, unlike image classification tasks, the unique characteristics of object detection -- particularly its output of numerous objects -- pose fresh challenges for backdoor detection. The complex attack effects (e.g., "ghost" object emergence or "vanishing" object) further render current defenses fundamentally inadequate. To this end, we design TRAnsformation Consistency Evaluation (TRACE), a brand-new method for detecting poisoned samples at test time in object detection. Our journey begins with two intriguing observations: (1) poisoned samples exhibit significantly more consistent detection results than clean ones across varied backgrounds. (2) clean samples show higher detection consistency when introduced to different focal information. Based on these phenomena, TRACE applies foreground and background transformations to each test sample, then assesses transformation consistency by calculating the variance in objects confidences. TRACE achieves black-box, universal backdoor detection, with extensive experiments showing a 30% improvement in AUROC over state-of-the-art defenses and resistance to adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[State Space Model Meets Transformer: A New Paradigm for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14493v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DETR-based methods, which use multi-layer transformer decoders to refine object queries iteratively, have shown promising performance in 3D indoor object detection. However, the scene point features in the transformer decoder remain fixed, leading to minimal contributions from later decoder layers, thereby limiting performance improvement. Recently, State Space Models (SSM) have shown efficient context modeling ability with linear complexity through iterative interactions between system states and inputs. Inspired by SSMs, we propose a new 3D object DEtection paradigm with an interactive STate space model (DEST). In the interactive SSM, we design a novel state-dependent SSM parameterization method that enables system states to effectively serve as queries in 3D indoor detection tasks. In addition, we introduce four key designs tailored to the characteristics of point cloud and SSM: The serialization and bidirectional scanning strategies enable bidirectional feature interaction among scene points within the SSM. The inter-state attention mechanism models the relationships between state points, while the gated feed-forward network enhances inter-channel correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to model queries as system states and scene points as system inputs, which can simultaneously update scene point features and query features with linear complexity. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DEST-based method. Our method improves the GroupFree baseline in terms of AP50 on ScanNet V2 (+5.3) and SUN RGB-D (+3.2) datasets.

The key to accurate 3D object detection is in effective voxel representation. However, due to occlusion and lack of 3D information, constructing 3D features from multi-view 2D images is challenging. Addressing that, we introduce a unique 3D positional information embedded voxel optimization mechanism to fuse multi-view features. To prioritize neural field reconstruction in object regions, we also devise a double importance sampling scheme for the NeRF branch of our detector. We additionally propose an opacity optimization module for precise voxel opacity prediction by enforcing multi-view consistency constraints. Moreover, to further improve voxel density consistency across multiple perspectives, we incorporate ray distance as a weighting factor to minimize cumulative ray errors. Our unique modules synergetically form an end-to-end neural model that establishes new state-of-the-art in NeRF-based multi-view 3D detection, verified with extensive experiments on ScanNet and ARKITScenes.

However, its faces multiple real-world edge deployment challenges including limited high-quality annotated data, data sharing restrictions, and computational constraints. In this work, we introduce UltraFlwr, a framework for federated medical and surgical object detection. By leveraging Federated Learning (FL), UltraFlwr enables decentralized model training across multiple sites without sharing raw data. To further enhance UltraFlwr's efficiency, we propose YOLO-PA, a set of novel Partial Aggregation (PA) strategies specifically designed for YOLO models in FL. YOLO-PA significantly reduces communication overhead by up to 83% per round while maintaining performance comparable to Full Aggregation (FA) strategies. Our extensive experiments on BCCD and m2cai16-tool-locations datasets demonstrate that YOLO-PA not only provides better client models compared to client-wise centralized training and FA strategies, but also facilitates efficient training and deployment across resource-constrained edge devices. Further, we also establish one of the first benchmarks in federated medical and surgical object detection. This paper advances the feasibility of training and deploying detection models on the edge, making federated object detection more practical for time-critical and resource-constrained medical and surgical applications.

LiDAR sensors, widely used for their ability to provide detailed 3D measurements, are key to achieving this capability. However, variations between training and inference data can cause significant performance drops when object detection models are employed in different sensor settings. One critical factor is beam density, as inference on sparse, cost-effective LiDAR sensors is often preferred in real-world applications. Despite previous work addressing the beam-density-induced domain gap, substantial knowledge gaps remain, particularly concerning dense 128-beam sensors in cross-domain scenarios. To gain better understanding of the impact of beam density on domain gaps, we conduct a comprehensive investigation that includes an evaluation of different object detection architectures. Our architecture evaluation reveals that combining voxel- and point-based approaches yields superior cross-domain performance by leveraging the strengths of both representations. Building on these findings, we analyze beam-density-induced domain gaps and argue that these domain gaps must be evaluated in conjunction with other domain shifts. Contrary to conventional beliefs, our experiments reveal that detectors benefit from training on denser data and exhibit robustness to beam density variations during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVWW 2025</p></details> | None |

To mitigate the sparse supervision inherent in one-to-one (O2O) matching in DETR models, DEIM employs a Dense O2O matching strategy. This approach increases the number of positive samples per image by incorporating additional targets, using standard data augmentation techniques. While Dense O2O matching speeds up convergence, it also introduces numerous low-quality matches that could affect performance. To address this, we propose the Matchability-Aware Loss (MAL), a novel loss function that optimizes matches across various quality levels, enhancing the effectiveness of Dense O2O. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset validate the efficacy of DEIM. When integrated with RT-DETR and D-FINE, it consistently boosts performance while reducing training time by 50%. Notably, paired with RT-DETRv2, DEIM achieves 53.2% AP in a single day of training on an NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Additionally, DEIM-trained real-time models outperform leading real-time object detectors, with DEIM-D-FINE-L and DEIM-D-FINE-X achieving 54.7% and 56.5% AP at 124 and 78 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, respectively, without the need for additional data. We believe DEIM sets a new baseline for advancements in real-time object detection.

Furthermore, the study shows the versatility of the IAMCV dataset through several proof-of-concept use cases. Firstly, an unsupervised trajectory clustering algorithm illustrates the dataset's capability in categorizing vehicle movements without the need for labeled training data. Secondly, we compare an online camera calibration method with the Robot Operating System-based standard, using images captured in the dataset. Finally, a preliminary test employing the YOLOv8 object-detection model is conducted, augmented by reflections on the transferability of object detection across various LIDAR resolutions.

In this paper, we propose the task of domain generalized oriented object detection, which intends to explore the generalization of oriented object detectors on arbitrary unseen target domains. Learning domain generalized oriented object detectors is particularly challenging, as the cross-domain style variation not only negatively impacts the content representation, but also leads to unreliable orientation predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized oriented object detector (GOOD). After style hallucination by the emerging contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), it consists of two key components, namely, rotation-aware content consistency learning (RAC) and style consistency learning (SEC). The proposed RAC allows the oriented object detector to learn stable orientation representation from style-diversified samples. The proposed SEC further stabilizes the generalization ability of content representation from different image styles. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain settings show the state-of-the-art performance of GOOD.

Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks. We validated our system in real-world environments with varying degrees of manual modifications, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in long-term tasks.

While this description is crucial for distinguishing the target from visually similar instances in a scene, providing it prior to navigation can be demanding for human. To bridge this gap, we introduce Collaborative Instance object Navigation (CoIN), a new task setting where the agent actively resolve uncertainties about the target instance during navigation in natural, template-free, open-ended dialogues with human. We propose a novel training-free method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), which operates independently from the navigation policy, and focuses on the human-agent interaction reasoning with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue within the agent to obtain a complete and accurate observation description with a novel uncertainty estimation technique. Then, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the human, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input. For evaluation, we introduce CoIN-Bench, with a curated dataset designed for challenging multi-instance scenarios. CoIN-Bench supports both online evaluation with humans and reproducible experiments with simulated user-agent interactions. On CoIN-Bench, we show that AIUTA serves as a competitive baseline, while existing language-driven instance navigation methods struggle in complex multi-instance scenes.

To address these issues, we propose a 4D radar-LiDAR framework to mutually enhance their representations. Initially, the indicative features from radar are utilized to guide both radar and LiDAR geometric feature learning. Subsequently, to mitigate their sparsity gap, the shape information from LiDAR is used to enrich radar BEV features. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate our approach's superiority over existing methods, achieving the highest mAP of 71.76% across the entire area and 86.36\% within the driving corridor.

However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers, multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to perform "local and global" spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes, Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly, our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel architecture that augments the prevalent decoding strategy in COD with Enrich Decoder and Retouch Decoder, which help to generate a fine-grained segmentation map. Specifically, the Enrich Decoder amplifies the channels of features that are important for COD using channel-wise attention. Retouch Decoder further refines the segmentation maps by spatially attending to important pixels, such as the boundary regions.

Aerial and satellite images inherently suffer from limitations such as low spatial resolution, sensor noise, blurred objects, low-light degradation, and partial occlusions. These degradation factors collectively compromise the feature discriminability in detection models, resulting in three key issues: (1) reduced contrast that hampers foreground-background separation, (2) structural discontinuities in edge representations, and (3) ambiguous feature responses caused by variations in illumination. These collectively weaken model robustness and deployment feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose LEGNet, a lightweight network that incorporates a novel edge-Gaussian aggregation (EGA) module specifically designed for low-quality remote sensing images. Our key innovation lies in the synergistic integration of Scharr operator-based edge priors with uncertainty-aware Gaussian modeling: (a) The orientation-aware Scharr filters preserve high-frequency edge details with rotational invariance; (b) The uncertainty-aware Gaussian layers probabilistically refine low-confidence features through variance estimation. This design enables precision enhancement while maintaining architectural simplicity. Comprehensive evaluations across four RSOD benchmarks (DOTA-v1.0, v1.5, DIOR-R, FAIR1M-v1.0) and a UAV-view dataset (VisDrone2019) demonstrate significant improvements.

Driven by the motivation that streamlining the infrared flow and harnessing PVMs with fewer parameters for superior performance, we propose "IV-tuning", a novel and general fine-tuning approach, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various infrared-visible downstream tasks. At its core, IV-tuning freezes pre-trained visible-based PVMs and integrates infrared flow into modal prompts to interact with adapters, which achieves a more efficient and general modal interaction paradigm. By fine-tuning approximately 3% of the backbone parameters, IV-tuning outperforms full fine-tuning and previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple baselines in multiple tasks, including IR-VIS salient object detection, semantic segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IV-tuning achieves superior performance with fewer trainable parameters, providing a good alternative to full fine-tuning and a novel method of extending visible-based models for infrared-visible tasks. The code will be provided in supplementary material.</p></details> |  | None |

Initially, we utilize the results of image-based two-dimensional object detection to narrow down the search region in the three-dimensional space of the point cloud. Next, we introduce a Gaussian mask to enhance the point cloud information. Then, we extract the features from the frustum point cloud and the crop image using the point cloud feature extraction pipeline and the image feature extraction pipeline, respectively. Finally, we concatenate and fuse the data features from both modalities to achieve three-dimensional object detection. Experiments demonstrate that on the constructed test set of tractor road data, the FrustumFusionNetv2 achieves 82.28% and 95.68% accuracy in the three-dimensional object detection of the two main road objects, cars and people, respectively. This performance is 1.83% and 2.33% better than the original model. It offers a hybrid fusion-based multi-object, high-precision, real-time three-dimensional object detection technique for unmanned agricultural machines in tractor road scenarios. On the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) Benchmark Suite validation set, the FrustumFusionNetv2 also demonstrates significant superiority in detecting road pedestrian objects compared with other frustum-based three-dimensional object detection methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Is Discretization Fusion All You Need for Collaborative Perception?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13946v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception in multi-agent system enhances overall perceptual capabilities by facilitating the exchange of complementary information among agents. Current mainstream collaborative perception methods rely on discretized feature maps to conduct fusion, which however, lacks flexibility in extracting and transmitting the informative features and can hardly focus on the informative features during fusion. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel Anchor-Centric paradigm for Collaborative Object detection (ACCO). It avoids grid precision issues and allows more flexible and efficient anchor-centric communication and fusion. ACCO is composed by three main components: (1) Anchor featuring block (AFB) that targets to generate anchor proposals and projects prepared anchor queries to image features. (2) Anchor confidence generator (ACG) is designed to minimize communication by selecting only the features in the confident anchors to transmit. (3) A local-global fusion module, in which local fusion is anchor alignment-based fusion (LAAF) and global fusion is conducted by spatial-aware cross-attention (SACA). LAAF and SACA run in multi-layers, so agents conduct anchor-centric fusion iteratively to adjust the anchor proposals. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate ACCO on OPV2V and Dair-V2X datasets, which demonstrate ACCO's superiority in reducing the communication volume, and in improving the perception range and detection performances.

However, recent SSL approaches fail to define pretext tasks that retain geometric information such as object pose and scale, which can be detrimental to the performance of downstream localization and geometry-sensitive 3D scene understanding tasks, such as 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We propose PSA-SSL, a novel extension to point cloud SSL that learns object pose and size-aware (PSA) features. Our approach defines a self-supervised bounding box regression pretext task, which retains object pose and size information. Furthermore, we incorporate LiDAR beam pattern augmentation on input point clouds, which encourages learning sensor-agnostic features. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single pretrained model, our light-weight yet effective extensions achieve significant improvements on 3D semantic segmentation with limited labels across popular autonomous driving datasets (Waymo, nuScenes, SemanticKITTI). Moreover, our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art SSL methods on 3D semantic segmentation (using up to 10 times less labels), as well as on 3D object detection. Our code will be released on https://github.com/TRAILab/PSA-SSL.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TRAILab/PSA-SSL) |

Hyperspectral images provide a promising solution for more accurate Hyperspectral Salient Object Detection (HSOD) by abundant spectral information, while HSOD methods are hindered by the lack of extensive and available datasets. In this context, we introduce HSOD-BIT-V2, the largest and most challenging HSOD benchmark dataset to date. Five distinct challenges focusing on small objects and foreground-background similarity are designed to emphasize spectral advantages and real-world complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hyper-HRNet, a high-resolution HSOD network. Hyper-HRNet effectively extracts, integrates, and preserves effective spectral information while reducing dimensionality by capturing the self-similar spectral features. Additionally, it conveys fine details and precisely locates object contours by incorporating comprehensive global information and detailed object saliency representations. Experimental analysis demonstrates that Hyper-HRNet outperforms existing models, especially in challenging scenarios.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |
| **[TGBFormer: Transformer-GraphFormer Blender Network for Video Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13903v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video object detection has made significant progress in recent years thanks to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Typically, CNNs excel at capturing local features but struggle to model global representations. Conversely, ViTs are adept at capturing long-range global features but face challenges in representing local feature details. Off-the-shelf video object detection methods solely rely on CNNs or ViTs to conduct feature aggregation, which hampers their capability to simultaneously leverage global and local information, thereby resulting in limited detection performance. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-GraphFormer Blender Network (TGBFormer) for video object detection, with three key technical improvements to fully exploit the advantages of transformers and graph convolutional networks while compensating for their limitations. First, we develop a spatial-temporal transformer module to aggregate global contextual information, constituting global representations with long-range feature dependencies. Second, we introduce a spatial-temporal GraphFormer module that utilizes local spatial and temporal relationships to aggregate features, generating new local representations that are complementary to the transformer outputs. Third, we design a global-local feature blender module to adaptively couple transformer-based global representations and GraphFormer-based local representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TGBFormer establishes new state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet VID dataset. Particularly, our TGBFormer achieves 86.5% mAP while running at around 41.0 FPS on a single Tesla A100 GPU.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 | None |

To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. Firstly, we introduce the High-Resolution Feature Map for Small Object Detection (HRFM-TOD) module to address indistinct small-object features in low-light scenarios. By leveraging high-resolution feature maps, HRFM-TOD effectively mitigates the feature dilution problem encountered in conventional PANet frameworks, thereby enhancing both detection accuracy and inference speed. Secondly, we develop the Multi-branch Feature Interaction Attention (MFIA) module, which facilitates deep feature interaction across multiple receptive fields in both channel and spatial dimensions, significantly improving the model's information extraction capabilities. Finally, we propose the Prior-Guided Enhancement Module (PGFE) to tackle common image quality challenges in low-light environments, such as noise, low contrast, and blurriness. This module employs prior knowledge to enrich image details and enhance visibility, substantially boosting detection performance. To support this research, we construct a novel dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios, including urban, highway, and rural environments under varying weather conditions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, and achieving superior results on the CCTSDB2021 dataset. Moreover, deployment experiments on edge devices confirm the real-time applicability and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this may lead to biased synthetic data and overfitting to specific configurations. It can sidestep biases of manually curated data generation by directly leveraging hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs), which is surprisingly rarely explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of a MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge transfer from LLMs to object detectors, an new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We demonstrate that intermediate hidden states from early LLM layers retain strong spatial-semantic correlations that are beneficial to grounding tasks. Experiments show that our adaptation strategy significantly enhances the performance on complex free-form text queries while remaining the same on plain categories. With our adaptation, Qwen2-0.5B with Swin-T as the vision encoder improves GroundingDINO by 2.33% on Omnilabel, at the overhead of 8.7% more GFLOPs. Qwen2-0.5B with a larger vision encoder can further boost the performance by 6.22%. We further validate our design by ablating on varied adapter architectures, sizes of LLMs, and which layers to add adaptation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[8-Calves Image dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13777v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the 8-Calves dataset, a benchmark for evaluating object detection and identity classification in occlusion-rich, temporally consistent environments. The dataset comprises a 1-hour video (67,760 frames) of eight Holstein Friesian calves in a barn, with ground truth bounding boxes and identities, alongside 900 static frames for detection tasks. Each calf exhibits a unique coat pattern, enabling precise identity distinction. For cow detection, we fine-tuned 28 models (25 YOLO variants, 3 transformers) on 600 frames, testing on the full video. Results reveal smaller YOLO models (e.g., YOLOV9c) outperform larger counterparts despite potential bias from a YOLOv8m-based labeling pipeline. For identity classification, embeddings from 23 pretrained vision models (ResNet, ConvNextV2, ViTs) were evaluated via linear classifiers and KNN. Modern architectures like ConvNextV2 excelled, while larger models frequently overfit, highlighting inefficiencies in scaling. Key findings include: (1) Minimal, targeted augmentations (e.g., rotation) outperform complex strategies on simpler datasets; (2) Pretraining strategies (e.g., BEiT, DinoV2) significantly boost identity recognition; (3) Temporal continuity and natural motion patterns offer unique challenges absent in synthetic or domain-specific benchmarks. The dataset's controlled design and extended sequences (1 hour vs. prior 10-minute benchmarks) make it a pragmatic tool for stress-testing occlusion handling, temporal consistency, and efficiency.

In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised domain adaptation approach, MonoCT, that generates highly accurate pseudo labels for self-supervision. Inspired by our observation that accurate depth estimation is critical to mitigating domain shifts, MonoCT introduces a novel Generalized Depth Enhancement (GDE) module with an ensemble concept to improve depth estimation accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a novel Pseudo Label Scoring (PLS) module by exploring inner-model consistency measurement and a Diversity Maximization (DM) strategy to further generate high-quality pseudo labels for self-training. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that MonoCT outperforms existing SOTA domain adaptation methods by large margins (~21% minimum for AP Mod.) and generalizes well to car, traffic camera and drone views.</p></details> | ICRA2025 | None |

Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) methods have recently demonstrated strong results on addressing this challenge. Unfortunately, we identify systemic benchmarking pitfalls that call past results into question and hamper further progress: (a) Overestimation of performance due to underpowered baselines, (b) Inconsistent implementation practices preventing transparent comparisons of methods, and (c) Lack of generality due to outdated backbones and lack of diversity in benchmarks. We address these problems by introducing: (1) A unified benchmarking and implementation framework, Align and Distill (ALDI), enabling comparison of DAOD methods and supporting future development, (2) A fair and modern training and evaluation protocol for DAOD that addresses benchmarking pitfalls, (3) A new DAOD benchmark dataset, CFC-DAOD, enabling evaluation on diverse real-world data, and (4) A new method, ALDI++, that achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin. ALDI++ outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by +3.5 AP50 on Cityscapes to Foggy Cityscapes, +5.7 AP50 on Sim10k to Cityscapes (where ours is the only method to outperform a fair baseline), and +0.6 AP50 on CFC Kenai to Channel. ALDI and ALDI++ are architecture-agnostic, setting a new state-of-the-art for YOLO and DETR-based DAOD as well without additional hyperparameter tuning. Our framework, dataset, and state-of-the-art method offer a critical reset for DAOD and provide a strong foundation for future research.

It represents the first comprehensive experimental evaluation of YOLOv3 to the latest version, YOLOv12, on various object detection challenges. The challenges considered include varying object sizes, diverse aspect ratios, and small-sized objects of a single class, ensuring a comprehensive assessment across datasets with distinct challenges. To ensure a robust evaluation, we employ a comprehensive set of metrics, including Precision, Recall, Mean Average Precision (mAP), Processing Time, GFLOPs count, and Model Size. Our analysis highlights the distinctive strengths and limitations of each YOLO version. For example: YOLOv9 demonstrates substantial accuracy but struggles with detecting small objects and efficiency whereas YOLOv10 exhibits relatively lower accuracy due to architectural choices that affect its performance in overlapping object detection but excels in speed and efficiency. Additionally, the YOLO11 family consistently shows superior performance maintaining a remarkable balance of accuracy and efficiency. However, YOLOv12 delivered underwhelming results, with its complex architecture introducing computational overhead without significant performance gains. These results provide critical insights for both industry and academia, facilitating the selection of the most suitable YOLO algorithm for diverse applications and guiding future enhancements.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |
| **[Quantifying the Reliability of Predictions in Detection Transformers: Object-Level Calibration and Image-Level Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01782v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DEtection TRansformer (DETR) has emerged as a promising architecture for object detection, offering an end-to-end prediction pipeline. In practice, however, DETR generates hundreds of predictions that far outnumber the actual number of objects present in an image. This raises the question: can we trust and use all of these predictions? Addressing this concern, we present empirical evidence highlighting how different predictions within the same image play distinct roles, resulting in varying reliability levels across those predictions. More specifically, while multiple predictions are often made for a single object, our findings show that most often one such prediction is well-calibrated, and the others are poorly calibrated. Based on these insights, we demonstrate that identifying a reliable subset of DETR's predictions is crucial for accurately assessing the reliability of the model at both object and image levels. Building on this viewpoint, we first address the shortcomings of widely used performance and calibration metrics, such as average precision and various forms of expected calibration error. Specifically, they are inadequate for determining which subset of DETR's predictions should be trusted and utilized. In response, we present Object-level Calibration Error (OCE), which assesses the calibration quality more effectively and is suitable for both ranking different models and identifying the most reliable predictions within a specific model. As a final contribution, we introduce a post hoc uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework that predicts the accuracy of the model on a per-image basis. By contrasting the average confidence scores of positive (i.e., likely to be matched) and negative predictions determined by OCE, our framework assesses the reliability of the DETR model for each test image.</p></details> |  | None |

While using latent diffusion models (LDMs) show promise in augmenting limited source data, we demonstrate that directly using synthetic data can be detrimental due to significant feature distribution discrepancies between synthetic and real target domains, leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Discriminative Domain Reassembly and Soft-Fusion (DRSF), a training framework leveraging synthetic data to improve model generalization. We employ LDMs to produce diverse pseudo-target domain samples and introduce two key modules to handle distribution bias. First, Discriminative Feature Decoupling and Reassembly (DFDR) module uses entropy-guided attention to recalibrate channel-level features, suppressing synthetic noise while preserving semantic consistency. Second, Multi-pseudo-domain Soft Fusion (MDSF) module uses adversarial training with latent-space feature interpolation, creating continuous feature transitions between domains. Extensive SDG experiments on object detection and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that DRSF achieves substantial performance gains with only marginal computational overhead. Notably, DRSF's plug-and-play architecture enables seamless integration with unsupervised domain adaptation paradigms, underscoring its broad applicability in addressing diverse and real-world domain challenges.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, this paradigm is constrained by the excessive feature compression. While some works explore dense voxel fusion to enable better feature interaction, they face high computational costs and challenges in query generation. Additionally, feature misalignment in both domains results in suboptimal detection accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a Dual-Domain Homogeneous Fusion network (DDHFusion), which leverages the complementarily of both BEV and voxel domains while mitigating their drawbacks. Specifically, we first transform image features into BEV and sparse voxel representations using lift-splat-shot and our proposed Semantic-Aware Feature Sampling (SAFS) module. The latter significantly reduces computational overhead by discarding unimportant voxels. Next, we introduce Homogeneous Voxel and BEV Fusion (HVF and HBF) networks for multi-modal fusion within respective domains. They are equipped with novel cross-modal Mamba blocks to resolve feature misalignment and enable comprehensive scene perception. The output voxel features are injected into the BEV space to compensate for the information loss brought by direct height compression. During query selection, the Progressive Query Generation (PQG) mechanism is implemented in the BEV domain to reduce false negatives caused by feature compression. Furthermore, we propose a Progressive Decoder (QD) that sequentially aggregates not only context-rich BEV features but also geometry-aware voxel features with deformable attention and the Multi-Modal Voxel Feature Mixing (MMVFM) block for precise classification and box regression.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, these ISP functions can lead to a loss of critical information that may be essential in optimizing for computer vision tasks, such as object detection. In this work, we introduce Raw Adaptation Module (RAM), a module designed to replace the traditional ISP, with parameters optimized specifically for RAW object detection. Inspired by the parallel processing mechanisms of the human visual system, RAM departs from existing learned ISP methods by applying multiple ISP functions in parallel rather than sequentially, allowing for a more comprehensive capture of image features. These processed representations are then fused in a specialized module, which dynamically integrates and optimizes the information for the target task. This novel approach not only leverages the full potential of RAW sensor data but also enables task-specific pre-processing, resulting in superior object detection performance. Our approach outperforms RGB-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse RAW image datasets under varying lighting conditions and dynamic ranges.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the success of previous works on cooperative object detection, they mostly operate on dense Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature maps, which are computationally demanding and can hardly be extended to long-range detection problems. More efficient fully sparse frameworks are rarely explored. In this work, we design a fully sparse framework, SparseAlign, with three key features: an enhanced sparse 3D backbone, a query-based temporal context learning module, and a robust detection head specially tailored for sparse features. Extensive experimental results on both OPV2V and DairV2X datasets show that our framework, despite its sparsity, outperforms the state of the art with less communication bandwidth requirements. In addition, experiments on the OPV2Vt and DairV2Xt datasets for time-aligned cooperative object detection also show a significant performance gain compared to the baseline works.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the inherent heterogeneity between these modalities, including unbalanced convergence and modal misalignment, poses significant challenges. Meanwhile, the large size of the detection-oriented feature also constrains existing fusion strategies to capture long-range dependencies for the 3D detection tasks. In this work, we introduce a fast yet effective multimodal 3D object detector, incorporating our proposed Instance-level Contrastive Distillation (ICD) framework and Cross Linear Attention Fusion Module (CLFM). ICD aligns instance-level image features with LiDAR representations through object-aware contrastive distillation, ensuring fine-grained cross-modal consistency. Meanwhile, CLFM presents an efficient and scalable fusion strategy that enhances cross-modal global interactions within sizable multimodal BEV features. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes 3D object detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

While existing OWOD methods primarily focus on detecting unknown objects, they often overlook the rich semantic relationships between detected objects, which are essential for scene understanding and applications in open-world environments (e.g., open-world tracking and novel class discovery). In this paper, we extend the OWOD framework to jointly detect unknown objects and learn semantically rich instance embeddings, enabling the detector to capture fine-grained semantic relationships between instances. To this end, we propose two modules that leverage the rich and generalizable knowledge of Vision Foundation Models(VFM). First, the Unknown Box Refine Module uses instance masks from the Segment Anything Model to accurately localize unknown objects. The Embedding Transfer Module then distills instance-wise semantic similarities from VFM features to the detector's embeddings via a relaxed contrastive loss, enabling the detector to learn a semantically meaningful and generalizable instance feature. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves both unknown object detection and instance embedding quality, while also enhancing performance in downstream tasks such as open-world tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website can be found at https://sunohlee.github.io/OW-Rep/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://sunohlee.github.io/OW-Rep) |

Tasks such as 3D Object Detection deliver an insufficiently detailed understanding of the surrounding scene because they only predict a bounding box for foreground objects. In contrast, 3D Semantic Segmentation provides richer and denser information about the environment by assigning a label to each individual point, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving tasks, such as navigation or lane changes. To inspire future research, in this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art methods in the field of Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for autonomous driving. We categorize the approaches into projection-based, 3D-based and hybrid methods. Moreover, we discuss the most important and commonly used datasets for this task and also emphasize the importance of synthetic data to support research when real-world data is limited.

While human vision adapts dynamically to environmental conditions, computational dehazing does not always enhance detection uniformly. We propose a multi-stage framework where a lightweight detector identifies regions of interest (RoIs), which are then improved via spatial attention-based dehazing before final detection by a heavier model. Though effective in foggy conditions, this approach unexpectedly degrades the performance on clear images. We analyze this phenomenon, investigate possible causes, and offer insights for designing hybrid pipelines that balance enhancement and detection. Our findings highlight the need for selective preprocessing and challenge assumptions about universal benefits from cascading transformations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p></details> |  | None |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

Manual processing remains error-prone and time-consuming, while current automated solutions are limited by their inability to support a variety of constraints, such as documents that are partially handwritten or photographed with a mobile phone. In this paper, we propose to automate the validation of machine written invoices using document layout analysis and object detection techniques based on recent deep learning (DL) models. We introduce a novel dataset consisting of manually annotated real-world invoices and a multi-criteria validation process. We fine-tune and benchmark the most relevant DL models on our dataset. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline and selected DL models in terms of achieving fast and accurate validation of invoices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Minuscule Cell Detection in AS-OCT Images with Progressive Field-of-View Focusing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12249v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) is an emerging imaging technique with great potential for diagnosing anterior uveitis, a vision-threatening ocular inflammatory condition. A hallmark of this condition is the presence of inflammatory cells in the eye's anterior chamber, and detecting these cells using AS-OCT images has attracted research interest. While recent efforts aim to replace manual cell detection with automated computer vision approaches, detecting extremely small (minuscule) objects in high-resolution images, such as AS-OCT, poses substantial challenges: (1) each cell appears as a minuscule particle, representing less than 0.005\% of the image, making the detection difficult, and (2) OCT imaging introduces pixel-level noise that can be mistaken for cells, leading to false positive detections. To overcome these challenges, we propose a minuscule cell detection framework through a progressive field-of-view focusing strategy. This strategy systematically refines the detection scope from the whole image to a target region where cells are likely to be present, and further to minuscule regions potentially containing individual cells. Our framework consists of two modules. First, a Field-of-Focus module uses a vision foundation model to segment the target region. Subsequently, a Fine-grained Object Detection module introduces a specialized Minuscule Region Proposal followed by a Spatial Attention Network to distinguish individual cells from noise within the segmented region. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cell detection, providing enhanced efficacy for clinical applications.

While traditional sparse convolution techniques efficiently capture local structures, they struggle with modeling long-range relationships. However, capturing long-range dependencies is fundamental for 3D object detection. In contrast, transformers are designed to capture these long-range dependencies through attention mechanisms. But, they come with high computational costs, due to their quadratic query-key-value interactions. Furthermore, directly applying attention to non-empty voxels is inefficient due to the sparse nature of 3D scenes. Our SFMNet is built on a novel Sparse Focal Modulation (SFM) module, which integrates short- and long-range contexts with linear complexity by leveraging a new hierarchical sparse convolution design. This approach enables SFMNet to achieve high detection performance with improved efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale LiDAR scenes. We show that our detector achieves state-of-the-art performance on autonomous driving datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion for LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10579v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D object detection presents significant challenges due to the inherent sparsity of LiDAR points. A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 | None |
| **[DVMNet++: Rethinking Relative Pose Estimation for Unseen Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13683v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the relative pose of a previously unseen object between two images is pivotal to the success of generalizable object pose estimation. Existing approaches typically predict 3D translation utilizing the ground-truth object bounding box and approximate 3D rotation with a large number of discrete hypotheses. This strategy makes unrealistic assumptions about the availability of ground truth and incurs a computationally expensive process of scoring each hypothesis at test time. By contrast, we rethink the problem of relative pose estimation for unseen objects by presenting a Deep Voxel Matching Network (DVMNet++). Our method computes the relative object pose in a single pass, eliminating the need for ground-truth object bounding boxes and rotation hypotheses. We achieve open-set object detection by leveraging image feature embedding and natural language understanding as reference. The detection result is then employed to approximate the translation parameters and crop the object from the query image. For rotation estimation, we map the two RGB images, i.e., reference and cropped query, to their respective voxelized 3D representations. The resulting voxels are passed through a rotation estimation module, which aligns the voxels and computes the rotation in an end-to-end fashion by solving a least-squares problem. To enhance robustness, we introduce a weighted closest voxel algorithm capable of mitigating the impact of noisy voxels. We conduct extensive experiments on the CO3D, Objaverse, LINEMOD, and LINEMOD-O datasets, demonstrating that our approach delivers more accurate relative pose estimates for novel objects at a lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Extensive research is dedicated to the RGB-IR object detection, primarily focusing on how to integrate complementary features from RGB-IR modalities. However, they neglect the mono-modality insufficient learning problem that the decreased feature extraction capability in multi-modal joint learning. This leads to an unreasonable but prevalent phenomenon--Fusion Degradation, which hinders the performance improvement of the MMOD model. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce linear probing evaluation to the multi-modal detectors and rethink the multi-modal object detection task from the mono-modality learning perspective. Therefore, we construct an novel framework called M$^2$D-LIF, which consists of the Mono-Modality Distillation (M$^2$D) method and the Local Illumination-aware Fusion (LIF) module. The M$^2$D-LIF framework facilitates the sufficient learning of mono-modality during multi-modal joint training and explores a lightweight yet effective feature fusion manner to achieve superior object detection performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three MMOD datasets demonstrate that our M$^2$D-LIF effectively mitigates the Fusion Degradation phenomenon and outperforms the previous SOTA detectors.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

More recently, researchers have used machine learning methods to speed up the process. However, for small particles in large sample volumes the performance of these methods falls short of standard physics-based reconstruction methods. Here we designed a two-stage neural network architecture, FLASH$\mu$, to detect small particles (6-100$\mu$m) from holograms with large sample depths up to 20cm. Trained only on synthetic data with added physical noise, our method reliably detects particles of at least 9$\mu$m diameter in real holograms, comparable to the standard reconstruction-based approaches while operating on smaller crops, at quarter of the original resolution and providing roughly a 600-fold speedup. In addition to introducing a novel approach to a non-local object detection or signal demixing problem, our work could enable low-cost, real-time holographic imaging setups.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable the student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different learning stages of KD. KD is a continuous process, but when adjusting the temperature, these methods consider only the immediate benefits of the operation in the current learning phase and fail to take into account its future returns. To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of temperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on reinforcement learning, termed RLKD. Importantly, we design a novel state representation to enable the agent to make more informed action (i.e. instance temperature adjustment). To handle the problem of delayed rewards in our method due to the KD setting, we explore an instance reward calibration approach. In addition,we devise an efficient exploration strategy that enables the agent to learn valuable instance temperature adjustment policy more efficiently. Our framework can serve as a plug-and-play technique to be inserted into various KD methods easily, and we validate its effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks.

However, crop detection, e.g., apple detection in orchard environments remains challenging due to a lack of large-scale datasets and the small relative size of the crops in the image.

Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters.

Backdoor attacks, in particular, pose a serious threat by implanting hidden triggers in victim models, which adversaries can later exploit to induce malicious behaviors during inference. However, current understanding is limited to single-target attacks, where adversaries must define a fixed malicious behavior (target) before training, making inference-time adaptability impossible. Given the large output space of object detection (including object existence prediction, bounding box estimation, and classification), the feasibility of flexible, inference-time model control remains unexplored. This paper introduces AnywhereDoor, a multi-target backdoor attack for object detection. Once implanted, AnywhereDoor allows adversaries to make objects disappear, fabricate new ones, or mislabel them, either across all object classes or specific ones, offering an unprecedented degree of control. This flexibility is enabled by three key innovations: (i) objective disentanglement to scale the number of supported targets; (ii) trigger mosaicking to ensure robustness even against region-based detectors; and (iii) strategic batching to address object-level data imbalances that hinder manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnywhereDoor grants attackers a high degree of control, improving attack success rates by 26% compared to adaptations of existing methods for such flexible control.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages; This update was mistakenly uploaded as a new manuscript on arXiv (2503.06529).

However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality and hinder reliable object detection in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-knowledge-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MKoIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MKoIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead to meet the requirements of real-time ITS deployment. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MKoIE surpasses existing methods, enhancing the reliability, accuracy, and operational efficiency of ITS.

However, to mitigate the misalignment between upstream image-text pretraining and downstream region-level perception, additional supervisions are indispensable, eg, image-text pairs or pseudo annotations generated via self-training strategies. In this work, we propose CCKT-Det trained without any extra supervision. The proposed framework constructs a cyclic and dynamic knowledge transfer from language queries and visual region features extracted from VLMs, which forces the detector to closely align with the visual-semantic space of VLMs. Specifically, 1) we prefilter and inject semantic priors to guide the learning of queries, and 2) introduce a regional contrastive loss to improve the awareness of queries on novel objects. CCKT-Det can consistently improve performance as the scale of VLMs increases, all while requiring the detector at a moderate level of computation overhead. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance gain of +2.9% and +10.2% AP50 over previous state-of-the-arts on the challenging COCO benchmark, both without and with a stronger teacher model.

Despite considerable progress in removing hand-crafted components and simplifying the architecture with transformers, multi-scale feature maps and pyramid designs remain a key factor for their empirical success. In this paper, we show that shifting the multiscale inductive bias into the attention mechanism can work well, resulting in a plain detector `SimPLR' whose backbone and detection head are both non-hierarchical and operate on single-scale features. We find through our experiments that SimPLR with scale-aware attention is plain and simple architecture, yet competitive with multi-scale vision transformer alternatives. Compared to the multi-scale and single-scale state-of-the-art, our model scales better with bigger capacity (self-supervised) models and more pre-training data, allowing us to report a consistently better accuracy and faster runtime for object detection, instance segmentation, as well as panoptic segmentation.

This emergent ability enables zero-shot object detection and segmentation, using techniques that rely on text-image attention maps, without necessarily training on abundant labeled segmentation datasets. However, performance of such methods depends heavily on prompt engineering and manually selected layers or head choices for the attention layers. In this work, we demonstrate that, rather than relying solely on textual prompts, providing a single visual example for each category and fine-tuning the text-to-image attention layers and embeddings significantly improves the performance. Additionally, we propose learning an ensemble through few-shot fine-tuning across multiple layers and/or prompts. An entropy-based ranking and selection mechanism for text-to-image attention layers is proposed to identify the top-performing layers without the need for segmentation labels. This eliminates the need for hyper-parameter selection of text-to-image attention layers, providing a more flexible and scalable solution for open-vocabulary segmentation. We show that this approach yields strong zero-shot performance, further enhanced through fine-tuning with a single visual example. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method and findings are general and can be applied across various vision-language models (VLMs).</p></details> |  | None |

It expands the perception range of autonomous vehicles, enhances the road safety. Previous methods focused on predicting per-pixel height rather than depth, making significant gains in roadside visual perception. While it is limited by the perspective property of near-large and far-small on image features, making it difficult for network to understand real dimension of objects in the 3D world. BEV features and voxel features present the real distribution of objects in 3D world compared to the image features. However, BEV features tend to lose details due to the lack of explicit height information, and voxel features are computationally expensive. Inspired by this insight, an efficient framework learning height prediction in voxel features via transformer is proposed, dubbed HeightFormer. It groups the voxel features into local height sequences, and utilize attention mechanism to obtain height distribution prediction. Subsequently, the local height sequences are reassembled to generate accurate 3D features. The proposed method is applied to two large-scale roadside benchmarks, DAIR-V2X-I and Rope3D. Extensive experiments are performed and the HeightFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in roadside vision centric 3D object detection task.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing roadside perception methods concentrate on model design but overlook data issues like calibration errors, sparse information, and multi-view consistency, leading to poor performance on recent published datasets. To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Different YOLOv8 models have been trained for each of the materials on different sized datasets, where the appearance was the only changing parameter. In the end, similar characteristics tend to show different behaviours and sometimes unexpected results. While some background components tend to be detected, others with the same features are not part of the detection. Additionally, some more precise conclusions can be drawn from the results. Therefore, we contribute a challenging dataset with detailed investigations on 92 trained YOLO models, addressing some issues on the detection accuracy and possible overfitting.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TARS: Traffic-Aware Radar Scene Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10210v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene flow provides crucial motion information for autonomous driving. Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel $\textbf{T}$raffic-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{R}$adar $\textbf{S}$cene flow estimation method, named $\textbf{TARS}$, which utilizes the motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. Therefrom, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space, enabling a holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Hierarchical Semantic Distillation Framework for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10152v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) aims to detect objects beyond the training annotations, where detectors are usually aligned to a pre-trained vision-language model, eg, CLIP, to inherit its generalizable recognition ability so that detectors can recognize new or novel objects. However, previous works directly align the feature space with CLIP and fail to learn the semantic knowledge effectively. In this work, we propose a hierarchical semantic distillation framework named HD-OVD to construct a comprehensive distillation process, which exploits generalizable knowledge from the CLIP model in three aspects. In the first hierarchy of HD-OVD, the detector learns fine-grained instance-wise semantics from the CLIP image encoder by modeling relations among single objects in the visual space. Besides, we introduce text space novel-class-aware classification to help the detector assimilate the highly generalizable class-wise semantics from the CLIP text encoder, representing the second hierarchy. Lastly, abundant image-wise semantics containing multi-object and their contexts are also distilled by an image-wise contrastive distillation. Benefiting from the elaborated semantic distillation in triple hierarchies, our HD-OVD inherits generalizable recognition ability from CLIP in instance, class, and image levels. Thus, we boost the novel AP on the OV-COCO dataset to 46.4% with a ResNet50 backbone, which outperforms others by a clear margin. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to analyze how each component works.</p></details> | Accepted to TMM 2025 | None |
| **[Deep Learning-Based Direct Leaf Area Estimation using Two RGBD Datasets for Model Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10129v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimation of a single leaf area can be a measure of crop growth and a phenotypic trait to breed new varieties. It has also been used to measure leaf area index and total leaf area. Some studies have used hand-held cameras, image processing 3D reconstruction and unsupervised learning-based methods to estimate the leaf area in plant images. Deep learning works well for object detection and segmentation tasks; however, direct area estimation of objects has not been explored. This work investigates deep learning-based leaf area estimation, for RGBD images taken using a mobile camera setup in real-world scenarios. A dataset for attached leaves captured with a top angle view and a dataset for detached single leaves were collected for model development and testing. First, image processing-based area estimation was tested on manually segmented leaves. Then a Mask R-CNN-based model was investigated, and modified to accept RGBD images and to estimate the leaf area. The detached-leaf data set was then mixed with the attached-leaf plant data set to estimate the single leaf area for plant images, and another network design with two backbones was proposed: one for segmentation and the other for area estimation. Instead of trying all possibilities or random values, an agile approach was used in hyperparameter tuning. The final model was cross-validated with 5-folds and tested with two unseen datasets: detached and attached leaves. The F1 score with 90% IoA for segmentation result on unseen detached-leaf data was 1.0, while R-squared of area estimation was 0.81. For unseen plant data segmentation, the F1 score with 90% IoA was 0.59, while the R-squared score was 0.57. The research suggests using attached leaves with ground truth area to improve the results.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the algorithmic backbone of neural networks is brittle to imperceptible perturbations in the system inputs, which were generally known as misclassifying attacks. By targeting the real-time processing capability, a new class of latency attacks are reported recently. They exploit new attack surfaces in object detectors by creating a computational bottleneck in the post-processing module, that leads to cascading failure and puts the real-time downstream tasks at risks. In this work, we take an initial attempt to defend against this attack via background-attentive adversarial training that is also cognizant of the underlying hardware capabilities. We first draw system-level connections between latency attack and hardware capacity across heterogeneous GPU devices. Based on the particular adversarial behaviors, we utilize objectness loss as a proxy and build background attention into the adversarial training pipeline, and achieve a reasonable balance between clean and robust accuracy. The extensive experiments demonstrate the defense effectiveness of restoring real-time processing capability from $13$ FPS to $43$ FPS on Jetson Orin NX, with a better trade-off between the clean and robust accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods are susceptible to the inaccurate calibration relationship between LiDAR and the camera sensor. Such inaccuracies result in errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, ultimately causing misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a robust fusion framework called Graph BEV. Addressing errors caused by inaccurate point cloud projection, we introduce a Local Align module that employs neighbor-aware depth features via Graph matching. Additionally, we propose a Global Align module to rectify the misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. Our Graph BEV framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an mAP of 70.1\%, surpassing BEV Fusion by 1.6\% on the nuscenes validation set. Importantly, our Graph BEV outperforms BEV Fusion by 8.3\% under conditions with misalignment noise.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the unavailability of target-domain data, some methods leverage the multimodal capabilities of vision-language models, using textual prompts to estimate cross-domain information, enhancing the model's generalization capability. These methods typically use a single textual prompt, often referred to as the one-step prompt method. However, when dealing with complex styles such as the combination of rain and night, we observe that the performance of the one-step prompt method tends to be relatively weak. The reason may be that many scenes incorporate not just a single style but a combination of multiple styles. The one-step prompt method may not effectively synthesize combined information involving various styles. To address this limitation, we propose a new method, i.e., Style Evolving along Chain-of-Thought, which aims to progressively integrate and expand style information along the chain of thought, enabling the continual evolution of styles. Specifically, by progressively refining style descriptions and guiding the diverse evolution of styles, this approach enables more accurate simulation of various style characteristics and helps the model gradually learn and adapt to subtle differences between styles. Additionally, it exposes the model to a broader range of style features with different data distributions, thereby enhancing its generalization capability in unseen domains. The significant performance gains over five adverse-weather scenarios and the Real to Art benchmark demonstrate the superiorities of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the data sparsity and limited views, the clustering-based label fitting in unsupervised object detection often generates low-quality pseudo-labels. Multi-agent collaborative dataset, which involves the sharing of complementary observations among agents, holds the potential to break through this bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method that learns to Detect Objects from Multi-Agent LiDAR scans, termed DOtA, without using labels from external. DOtA first uses the internally shared ego-pose and ego-shape of collaborative agents to initialize the detector, leveraging the generalization performance of neural networks to infer preliminary labels. Subsequently,DOtA uses the complementary observations between agents to perform multi-scale encoding on preliminary labels, then decodes high-quality and low-quality labels. These labels are further used as prompts to guide a correct feature learning process, thereby enhancing the performance of the unsupervised object detection task. Extensive experiments on the V2V4Real and OPV2V datasets show that our DOtA outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised 3D object detection methods. Additionally, we also validate the effectiveness of the DOtA labels under various collaborative perception frameworks.The code is available at https://github.com/xmuqimingxia/DOtA.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/xmuqimingxia/DOtA) |

Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p></details> |  | None |

An experimental study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09807v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based multi-object detection (MOD) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are advancing at a fast pace. A variety of 2D and 3D MOD and MOT methods have been developed for monocular and stereo cameras. Road safety analysis can benefit from those advancements. As crashes are rare events, surrogate measures of safety (SMoS) have been developed for safety analyses. (Semi-)Automated safety analysis methods extract road user trajectories to compute safety indicators, for example, Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Post-encroachment Time (PET). Inspired by the success of deep learning in MOD and MOT, we investigate three MOT methods, including one based on a stereo-camera, using the annotated KITTI traffic video dataset. Two post-processing steps, IDsplit and SS, are developed to improve the tracking results and investigate the factors influencing the TTC. The experimental results show that, despite some advantages in terms of the numbers of interactions or similarity to the TTC distributions, all the tested methods systematically over-estimate the number of interactions and under-estimate the TTC: they report more interactions and more severe interactions, making the road user interactions appear less safe than they are. Further efforts will be directed towards testing more methods and more data, in particular from roadside sensors, to verify the results and improve the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by TRB Annual Meeting 2024</p></details> | None |

Generic VLM benchmarks are not designed to handle the complexities of geospatial data, an essential component for applications such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. Key challenges in the geospatial domain include temporal change detection, large-scale object counting, tiny object detection, and understanding relationships between entities in remote sensing imagery. To bridge this gap, we present GEOBench-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs on geospatial tasks, including scene understanding, object counting, localization, fine-grained categorization, segmentation, and temporal analysis. Our benchmark features over 10,000 manually verified instructions and spanning diverse visual conditions, object types, and scales. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs to assess performance on geospatial-specific challenges. The results indicate that although existing VLMs demonstrate potential, they face challenges when dealing with geospatial-specific tasks, highlighting the room for further improvements. Notably, the best-performing LLaVa-OneVision achieves only 41.7% accuracy on MCQs, slightly more than GPT-4o, which is approximately double the random guess performance.

Unfortunately, these models are not yet widely adopted in health monitoring due to exceptionally high requirements for model robustness and deployment in highly resource-constrained devices. In particular, the acquisition of biosignals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), is subject to large variations between training and deployment, necessitating domain generalization (DG) for robust classification quality across sensors and patients. The continuous monitoring of ECG also requires the execution of DNN models in convenient wearable devices, which is achieved by specialized ECG accelerators with small form factor and ultra-low power consumption. However, combining DG capabilities with ECG accelerators remains a challenge. This article provides a comprehensive overview of ECG accelerators and DG methods and discusses the implication of the combination of both domains, such that multi-domain ECG monitoring is enabled with emerging algorithm-hardware co-optimized systems. Within this context, an approach based on correction layers is proposed to deploy DG capabilities on the edge. Here, the DNN fine-tuning for unknown domains is limited to a single layer, while the remaining DNN model remains unmodified. Thus, computational complexity (CC) for DG is reduced with minimal memory overhead compared to conventional fine-tuning of the whole DNN model. The DNN model-dependent CC is reduced by more than 2.5x compared to DNN fine-tuning at an average increase of F1 score by more than 20% on the generalized target domain. In summary, this article provides a novel perspective on robust DNN classification on the edge for health monitoring applications.</p></details> |  | None |

It introduces geometric priors from 2D bounding boxes and 3D object dimensions to reduce the uncertainty of depth estimation. However, due to depth errors originating from the object's visual surface, the height of the bounding box often fails to represent the actual projected central height, which undermines the effectiveness of geometric depth. Direct prediction for the projected height unavoidably results in a loss of 2D priors, while multi-depth prediction with complex branches does not fully leverage geometric depth. This paper presents a Transformer-based monocular 3D object detection method called MonoDGP, which adopts perspective-invariant geometry errors to modify the projection formula. We also try to systematically discuss and explain the mechanisms and efficacy behind geometry errors, which serve as a simple but effective alternative to multi-depth prediction. Additionally, MonoDGP decouples the depth-guided decoder and constructs a 2D decoder only dependent on visual features, providing 2D priors and initializing object queries without the disturbance of 3D detection. To further optimize and fine-tune input tokens of the transformer decoder, we also introduce a Region Segment Head (RSH) that generates enhanced features and segment embeddings. Our monocular method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark without extra data.

However, these approaches predominantly depend on single-vehicle data collection for model training and optimization, resulting in significant challenges such as high data acquisition and annotation costs, the scarcity of critical driving scenarios, and fragmented datasets that impede model generalization. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce RS2V-L, a novel framework for reconstructing and synthesizing vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor observations. Specifically, our method transforms roadside LiDAR point clouds into the vehicle-mounted LiDAR coordinate system by leveraging the target vehicle's relative pose. Subsequently, high-fidelity vehicle-mounted LiDAR data is synthesized through virtual LiDAR modeling, point cloud classification, and resampling techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to reconstruct vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that incorporating the generated data into model training-complementing the KITTI dataset-enhances 3D object detection accuracy by over \text{30\%} while improving the efficiency of end-to-end autonomous driving data generation by more than an order of magnitude. These findings strongly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and underscore its potential in reducing dependence on costly vehicle-mounted data collection while improving the robustness of autonomous driving models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon self-examination, we have found that the data in the experimental section of our paper is uncertain.

Unlike previous geometric-primitive-based methods that rely on the detection of corners, our method focuses on edge detection as the primary mechanism for roof reconstruction, while utilizing geometric relationships to define corners and faces. We adapt the YOLOv8 OBB model, originally designed for rotated object detection, to extract roof edges effectively. Our method demonstrates robustness against noise and occlusion, leading to precise vectorized representations of building roofs. Experiments conducted on the SGA and Melville datasets highlight the method's effectiveness.

At the vector level, evaluation using the Hausdorff distance, PolyS metric, and our raster-vector-metric demonstrates significant improvements after polygonization, with a close approximation to the reference data. The method successfully handles diverse roof structures and refines edge gaps, even on complex roof structures of new, excluded from training datasets.

However, the computational demands of these models, particularly with large image sizes and multiple transformer layers, pose significant challenges for efficient running on edge devices. Existing pruning and distillation methods either need retraining or are designed for ViT models, which are hard to migrate to 3D detectors. To address this issue, we propose a zero-shot runtime pruning method for transformer decoders in 3D object detection models. The method, termed tgGBC (trim keys gradually Guided By Classification scores), systematically trims keys in transformer modules based on their importance. We expand the classification score to multiply it with the attention map to get the importance score of each key and then prune certain keys after each transformer layer according to their importance scores. Our method achieves a 1.99x speedup in the transformer decoder of the latest ToC3D model, with only a minimal performance loss of less than 1%. Interestingly, for certain models, our method even enhances their performance. Moreover, we deploy 3D detectors with tgGBC on an edge device, further validating the effectiveness of our method.

While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for energy-efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here, we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates DWConvL-STMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.</p></details> |  | None |

Domain Generalization (DG) aims to mitigate this by training detectors that are invariant to such domain shifts. Current DG approaches exclusively rely on global geometric features (point cloud Cartesian coordinates) as input features. Over-reliance on these global geometric features can, however, cause 3D detectors to prioritize object location and absolute position, resulting in poor cross-domain performance. To mitigate this, we propose to exploit explicit local point cloud structure for DG, in particular by encoding point cloud neighborhoods with Gaussian blobs, GBlobs. Our proposed formulation is highly efficient and requires no additional parameters. Without any bells and whistles, simply by integrating GBlobs in existing detectors, we beat the current state-of-the-art in challenging single-source DG benchmarks by over 21 mAP (Waymo->KITTI), 13 mAP (KITTI->Waymo), and 12 mAP (nuScenes->KITTI), without sacrificing in-domain performance.

However, despite the strong performance of PETR-based methods in 3D perception benchmarks, their direct INT8 quantization for onboard deployment leads to drastic accuracy drops-up to 58.2% in mAP and 36.9% in NDS on the NuScenes dataset. In this work, we propose Q-PETR, a quantization-aware position embedding transformation that re-engineers key components of the PETR framework to reconcile the discrepancy between the dynamic ranges of positional encodings and image features, and to adapt the cross-attention mechanism for low-bit inference. By redesigning the positional encoding module and introducing an adaptive quantization strategy, Q-PETR maintains floating-point performance with a performance degradation of less than 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor post-training quantization. Moreover, compared to its FP32 counterpart, Q-PETR achieves a two-fold speedup and reduces memory usage by three times, thereby offering a deployment-friendly solution for resource-constrained onboard devices. Extensive experiments across various PETR-series models validate the strong generalization and practical benefits of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Referring to Any Person](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08507v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans are undoubtedly the most important participants in computer vision, and the ability to detect any individual given a natural language description, a task we define as referring to any person, holds substantial practical value. However, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world usability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one referring, that hinder progress in this area. In this work, we revisit this task from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and model architecture. We first identify five aspects of referable entities and three distinctive characteristics of this task. Next, we introduce HumanRef, a novel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world applications. From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large language model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust referring model named RexSeek. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple individuals. In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also generalizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly applicable across various perception tasks.

We investigate using superpixels coupled with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between detector-based captioning architectures and those that solely pretrain on large datasets. Our novel superpixel approach ensures that the model receives object-like features whilst the use of VLMs provides our model with open set object understanding. Furthermore, we extend our architecture to make use of multi-resolution inputs, allowing our model to view images in different levels of detail, and use an attention mechanism to determine which parts are most relevant to the caption. We demonstrate our model's performance with multiple VLMs and through a range of ablations detailing the impact of different architectural choices. Our full model achieves a competitive CIDEr score of $136.9$ on the COCO Karpathy split.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures | None |

Conventional methods are difficult to meet the requirements of real-time inference due to the two-stage or point-based architecture. Inspired by the success of multi-level fully sparse convolutional architecture in 3D object detection, we aim to build a new 3D visual grounding framework following this technical route. However, as in 3D visual grounding task the 3D scene representation should be deeply interacted with text features, sparse convolution-based architecture is inefficient for this interaction due to the large amount of voxel features. To this end, we propose text-guided pruning (TGP) and completion-based addition (CBA) to deeply fuse 3D scene representation and text features in an efficient way by gradual region pruning and target completion. Specifically, TGP iteratively sparsifies the 3D scene representation and thus efficiently interacts the voxel features with text features by cross-attention. To mitigate the affect of pruning on delicate geometric information, CBA adaptively fixes the over-pruned region by voxel completion with negligible computational overhead. Compared with previous single-stage methods, our method achieves top inference speed and surpasses previous fastest method by 100\% FPS. Our method also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy even compared with two-stage methods, with $+1.13$ lead of Acc@0.5 on ScanRefer, and $+2.6$ and $+3.2$ leads on NR3D and SR3D respectively.

In the community, various data-driven approaches have been developed to address this issue, yet their effectiveness is limited. This is mainly because most existing crowd counting datasets on which the methods are trained are based on passive cameras, restricting their ability to fully sense the environment. Recently, embodied navigation methods have shown significant potential in precise object detection in interactive scenes. These methods incorporate active camera settings, holding promise in addressing the fundamental issues in crowd counting. However, most existing methods are designed for indoor navigation, showing unknown performance in analyzing complex object distribution in large scale scenes, such as crowds. Besides, most existing embodied navigation datasets are indoor scenes with limited scale and object quantity, preventing them from being introduced into dense crowd analysis. Based on this, a novel task, Embodied Crowd Counting (ECC), is proposed. We first build up an interactive simulator, Embodied Crowd Counting Dataset (ECCD), which enables large scale scenes and large object quantity. A prior probability distribution that approximates realistic crowd distribution is introduced to generate crowds. Then, a zero-shot navigation method (ZECC) is proposed. This method contains a MLLM driven coarse-to-fine navigation mechanism, enabling active Z-axis exploration, and a normal-line-based crowd distribution analysis method for fine counting. Experimental results against baselines show that the proposed method achieves the best trade-off between counting accuracy and navigation cost.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bringing the Context Back into Object Recognition, Robustly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15933v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In object recognition, both the subject of interest (referred to as foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG) may play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to unintended over-reliance on the BG, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. The problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG, sacrificing context information for improved generalization. We propose "Localize to Recognize Robustly" (L2R2), a novel recognition approach which exploits the benefits of context-aware classification while maintaining robustness to distribution shifts. L2R2 leverages advances in zero-shot detection to localize the FG before recognition. It improves the performance of both standard recognition with supervised training, as well as multimodal zero-shot recognition with VLMs, while being robust to long-tail BGs and distribution shifts. The results confirm localization before recognition is possible for a wide range of datasets and they highlight the limits of object detection on others</p></details> |  | None |

| **[MAGIC: Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation in Context through Collaborative LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08014v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical adversarial attacks in driving scenarios can expose critical vulnerabilities in visual perception models. However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world environments and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality. Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch generation problem. Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments. The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate deployment within the scene. We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges. MAGIC automatically understands scene context and generates adversarial patch through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities. In particular, MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal deployment strategies based on scene understanding. The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes. We validate our method on both digital and physical levels, i.e., nuImage and manually captured real-world scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effective for attacking widely applied object detection systems, i.e., YOLO and DETR series.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SparseVoxFormer: Sparse Voxel-based Transformer for Multi-modal 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08092v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most previous 3D object detection methods that leverage the multi-modality of LiDAR and cameras utilize the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space for intermediate feature representation. However, this space uses a low x, y-resolution and sacrifices z-axis information to reduce the overall feature resolution, which may result in declined accuracy. To tackle the problem of using low-resolution features, this paper focuses on the sparse nature of LiDAR point cloud data. From our observation, the number of occupied cells in the 3D voxels constructed from a LiDAR data can be even fewer than the number of total cells in the BEV map, despite the voxels' significantly higher resolution. Based on this, we introduce a novel sparse voxel-based transformer network for 3D object detection, dubbed as SparseVoxFormer. Instead of performing BEV feature extraction, we directly leverage sparse voxel features as the input for a transformer-based detector. Moreover, with regard to the camera modality, we introduce an explicit modality fusion approach that involves projecting 3D voxel coordinates onto 2D images and collecting the corresponding image features. Thanks to these components, our approach can leverage geometrically richer multi-modal features while even reducing the computational cost. Beyond the proof-of-concept level, we further focus on facilitating better multi-modal fusion and flexible control over the number of sparse features. Finally, thorough experimental results demonstrate that utilizing a significantly smaller number of sparse features drastically reduces computational costs in a 3D object detector while enhancing both overall and long-range performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the lack of quality datasets hinders research and development. We report a new method that is able to simulate 4D millimeter wave radar signals including pitch, yaw, range, and Doppler velocity along with radar signal strength (RSS) using camera image, light detection and ranging (lidar) point cloud, and ego-velocity. The method is based on two new neural networks: 1) DIS-Net, which estimates the spatial distribution and number of radar signals, and 2) RSS-Net, which predicts the RSS of the signal based on appearance and geometric information. We have implemented and tested our method using open datasets from 3 different models of commercial automotive radar. The experimental results show that our method can successfully generate high-fidelity radar signals. Moreover, we have trained a popular object detection neural network with data augmented by our synthesized radar. The network outperforms the counterpart trained only on raw radar data, a promising result to facilitate future radar-based research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

Due to diverse variations and instrumentation, detecting the occurrence of leitmotifs from audio recordings is a highly challenging task. Leitmotif detection may be handled as a subcategory of audio event detection, where leitmotif activity is predicted at the frame level. However, as leitmotifs embody distinct, coherent musical structures, a more holistic approach akin to bounding box regression in visual object detection can be helpful. This method captures the entirety of a motif rather than fragmenting it into individual frames, thereby preserving its musical integrity and producing more useful predictions. We present our experimental results on tackling leitmotif detection as a boundary regression task.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 1 figure; presented at the 2024 ISMIR conference Late-Breaking Demo</p></details> | None |
| **[ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10283v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring safety for physical agents remains an open challenge. For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.</p></details> |  | None |

The recent success of vision-language models (VLMs) has demonstrated their remarkable capabilities to understand open vocabularies. Existing works that leverage VLMs for 3D object detection (3DOD) generally resort to representations that lose the rich scene context required for 3D perception. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a hierarchical framework, named HCMA, to simultaneously learn local object and global scene information for OV-3DOD. Specifically, we first design a Hierarchical Data Integration (HDI) approach to obtain coarse-to-fine 3D-image-text data, which is fed into a VLM to extract object-centric knowledge. To facilitate the association of feature hierarchies, we then propose an Interactive Cross-Modal Alignment (ICMA) strategy to establish effective intra-level and inter-level feature connections. To better align features across different levels, we further propose an Object-Focusing Context Adjustment (OFCA) module to refine multi-level features by emphasizing object-related features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms SOTA methods on the existing OV-3DOD benchmarks. It also achieves promising OV-3DOD results even without any 3D annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 (Extented Version).

In this work, we exploit an overlooked property of adversarial perturbations--their dependence on image transforms--and introduce transform-dependent adversarial attacks. Unlike traditional attacks, our perturbations exhibit metamorphic properties, enabling diverse adversarial effects as a function of transformation parameters. We demonstrate that this transform-dependent vulnerability exists across different architectures (e.g., CNN and transformer), vision tasks (e.g., image classification and object detection), and a wide range of image transforms. Additionally, we show that transform-dependent perturbations can serve as a defense mechanism, preventing sensitive information disclosure when image enhancement transforms pose a risk of revealing private content. Through analysis in blackbox and defended model settings, we show that transform-dependent perturbations achieve high targeted attack success rates, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer attacks by 17-31% in blackbox scenarios. Our work introduces novel, controllable paradigm for adversarial attack deployment, revealing a previously overlooked vulnerability in deep networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, we propose Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, we present Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency. Extensive experiments show YOLOE's exceptional zero-shot performance and transferability with high inference efficiency and low training cost. Notably, on LVIS, with 3$\times$ less training cost and 1.4$\times$ inference speedup, YOLOE-v8-S surpasses YOLO-Worldv2-S by 3.5 AP. When transferring to COCO, YOLOE-v8-L achieves 0.6 AP$^b$ and 0.4 AP$^m$ gains over closed-set YOLOv8-L with nearly 4$\times$ less training time.

This study proposes a model called HGO-YOLO, which integrates the HGNetv2 architecture into YOLOv8. This combination expands the receptive field and captures a wider range of features while simplifying model complexity through GhostConv. We introduced a lightweight detection head, OptiConvDetect, which utilizes parameter sharing to construct the detection head effectively. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a mAP@0.5 of 87.4% and a recall rate of 81.1%, with a model size of only 4.6 MB and a frame rate of 56 FPS on the CPU. HGO-YOLO not only improves accuracy by 3.0% but also reduces computational load by 51.69% (from 8.9 GFLOPs to 4.3 GFLOPs), while increasing the frame rate by a factor of 1.7. Additionally, real-time tests were conducted on Raspberry Pi4 and NVIDIA platforms. These results indicate that the HGO-YOLO model demonstrates superior performance in anomaly behavior detection.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

Filtering techniques based on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection are commonly added as an extra safeguard to filter hallucinations caused by overconfidence in novel objects. Nevertheless, evaluating YOLO-family detectors and their filters under existing OoD benchmarks often leads to unsatisfactory performance. This paper studies the underlying reasons for performance bottlenecks and proposes a methodology to improve performance fundamentally. Our first contribution is a calibration of all existing evaluation results: Although images in existing OoD benchmark datasets are claimed not to have objects within in-distribution (ID) classes (i.e., categories defined in the training dataset), around 13% of objects detected by the object detector are actually ID objects. Dually, the ID dataset containing OoD objects can also negatively impact the decision boundary of filters. These ultimately lead to a significantly imprecise performance estimation. Our second contribution is to consider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors and filters. By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset that semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted OoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness score, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a combined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving benchmark BDD-100K.

| **[Semantic Communications with Computer Vision Sensing for Edge Video Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07252v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of vision sensors in edge applications, such as surveillance, the transmission of video data consumes substantial spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SC) offers a solution by extracting and compressing information at the semantic level, preserving the accuracy and relevance of transmitted data while significantly reducing the volume of transmitted information. However, traditional SC methods face inefficiencies due to the repeated transmission of static frames in edge videos, exacerbated by the absence of sensing capabilities, which results in spectrum inefficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a SC with computer vision sensing (SCCVS) framework for edge video transmission. The framework first introduces a compression ratio (CR) adaptive SC (CRSC) model, capable of adjusting CR based on whether the frames are static or dynamic, effectively conserving spectrum resources. Additionally, we implement an object detection and semantic segmentation models-enabled sensing (OSMS) scheme, which intelligently senses the changes in the scene and assesses the significance of each frame through in-context analysis. Hence, The OSMS scheme provides CR prompts to the CRSC model based on real-time sensing results. Moreover, both CRSC and OSMS are designed as lightweight models, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained sensors commonly used in practical edge applications. Experimental simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCCVS framework, demonstrating its ability to enhance transmission efficiency without sacrificing critical semantic information.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditionally, 3D object detection methods are trained in a fully-supervised setup, requiring LiDAR and vast amounts of human annotations, which are laborious, costly, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing amounts of data being captured. We present a novel method to train a 3D object detector from a single RGB camera without domain-specific human annotations, making orders of magnitude more data available for training. The method uses newly proposed Local Object Motion Model to disentangle object movement source between subsequent frames, is approximately 700 times faster than previous work and compensates camera focal length differences to aggregate multiple datasets. The method is evaluated on three public datasets, where despite using no human labels, it outperforms prior work by a significant margin. It also shows its versatility as a pre-training tool for fully-supervised training and shows that combining pseudo-labels from multiple datasets can achieve comparable accuracy to using human labels from a single dataset. The source code and model will be published soon.</p></details> |  | None |

Integrating Camera and LIDAR data has emerged as an effective approach for achieving high accuracy in 3D Object Detection models. However, existing methodologies often rely on heavy, traditional backbones that are computationally demanding. This paper introduces a novel approach that incorporates cutting-edge Deep Learning techniques into the feature extraction process, aiming to create more efficient models without compromising performance.

This enables improved detection accuracy and more efficient hardware designs by bypassing the ISP. However, RAW object detection is challenging due to limited training data, unbalanced pixel distributions, and sensor noise. To address this, we propose SimROD, a lightweight and effective approach for RAW object detection. We introduce a Global Gamma Enhancement (GGE) module, which applies a learnable global gamma transformation with only four parameters, improving feature representation while keeping the model efficient. Additionally, we leverage the green channel's richer signal to enhance local details, aligning with the human eye's sensitivity and Bayer filter design. Extensive experiments on multiple RAW object detection datasets and detectors demonstrate that SimROD outperforms state-of-the-art methods like RAW-Adapter and DIAP while maintaining efficiency.

| **[Availability-aware Sensor Fusion via Unified Canonical Space for 4D Radar, LiDAR, and Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07029v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensor fusion of camera, LiDAR, and 4-dimensional (4D) Radar has brought a significant performance improvement in autonomous driving (AD). However, there still exist fundamental challenges: deeply coupled fusion methods assume continuous sensor availability, making them vulnerable to sensor degradation and failure, whereas sensor-wise cross-attention fusion methods struggle with computational cost and unified feature representation. This paper presents availability-aware sensor fusion (ASF), a novel method that employs unified canonical projection (UCP) to enable consistency in all sensor features for fusion and cross-attention across sensors along patches (CASAP) to enhance robustness of sensor fusion against sensor degradation and failure. As a result, the proposed ASF shows a superior object detection performance to the existing state-of-the-art fusion methods under various weather and sensor degradation (or failure) conditions; Extensive experiments on the K-Radar dataset demonstrate that ASF achieves improvements of 9.7% in AP BEV (87.2%) and 20.1% in AP 3D (73.6%) in object detection at IoU=0.5, while requiring a low computational cost.

Self-distillation recently is emerging as a promising approach for fine-tuning VLMs to better adapt to local regions without requiring extensive annotations. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from significant `foreground bias', where models tend to wrongly identify background regions as foreground objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. DenseVLM leverages the pre-trained VLM to retrieve categories for unlabeled regions and then decouples the interference between foreground and background features. We show that DenseVLM can directly replace the original VLM in open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation methods, leading to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, it exhibits promising zero-shot scalability when training on more extensive and diverse datasets.

However, most existing methods focus on detecting predefined object categories, limiting their applicability in real-world open scenarios. In this paper, we extend aerial object detection to open scenarios through image-text collaboration and propose OVA-Det, a highly efficient open-vocabulary detector for aerial scenes. Specifically, we first introduce an image-to-text alignment loss to replace the conventional category regression loss, thereby eliminating category limitations. Next, we propose a lightweight text-guided strategy that enhances the feature extraction process in the encoder and enables queries to focus on class-relevant image features within the decoder, further improving detection accuracy without introducing significant additional costs. Extensive comparison experiments demonstrate that the proposed OVA-Det outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all three widely used benchmark datasets by a large margin. For instance, for zero-shot detection on DIOR, OVA-Det achieves 37.2 mAP and 79.8 Recall, 12.4 and 42.0 higher than that of YOLO-World. In addition, the inference speed of OVA-Det reaches 36 FPS on RTX 4090, meeting the real-time detection requirements for various applications.

To address this problem, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) guided Progressive feature Alignment Network called LPANet, which leverages the semantic features extracted from a large language model to guide the progressive semantic and spatial alignment between modalities for multimodal UAV object detection. To employ the powerful semantic representation of LLM, we generate the fine-grained text descriptions of each object category by ChatGPT and then extract the semantic features using the large language model MPNet. Based on the semantic features, we guide the semantic and spatial alignments in a progressive manner as follows. First, we design the Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to pull the semantic features and multimodal visual features of each object closer, alleviating the semantic differences of objects between modalities. Second, we design the Explicit Spatial alignment Module (ESM) by integrating the semantic relations into the estimation of feature-level offsets, alleviating the coarse spatial misalignment between modalities. Finally, we design the Implicit Spatial alignment Module (ISM), which leverages the cross-modal correlations to aggregate key features from neighboring regions to achieve implicit spatial alignment. Comprehensive experiments on two public multimodal UAV object detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal UAV object detectors.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ReynoldsFlow: Exquisite Flow Estimation via Reynolds Transport Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04500v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow is a fundamental technique for motion estimation, widely applied in video stabilization, interpolation, and object tracking. Traditional optical flow estimation methods rely on restrictive assumptions like brightness constancy and slow motion constraints. Recent deep learning-based flow estimations require extensive training on large domain-specific datasets, making them computationally demanding. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) advances have enabled deep learning models to take advantage of optical flow as an important feature for object tracking and motion analysis. Since optical flow is commonly encoded in HSV for visualization, its conversion to RGB for neural network processing is nonlinear and may introduce perceptual distortions. These transformations amplify the sensitivity to estimation errors, potentially affecting the predictive accuracy of the networks. To address these challenges that are influential to the performance of downstream network models, we propose Reynolds flow, a novel training-free flow estimation inspired by the Reynolds transport theorem, offering a principled approach to modeling complex motion dynamics. In addition to conventional HSV-based visualization of Reynolds flow, we also introduce an RGB-encoded representation of Reynolds flow designed to improve flow visualization and feature enhancement for neural networks. We evaluated the effectiveness of Reynolds flow in video-based tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks, tiny object detection on UAVDB, infrared object detection on Anti-UAV, and pose estimation on GolfDB, demonstrate that networks trained with RGB-encoded Reynolds flow achieve SOTA performance, exhibiting improved robustness and efficiency across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Large language models (LLMs) have been deployed for generalized optimization scenarios. To take advantage of generative AI (GAI) models, we propose retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for multi-sensor wireless environment perception. Utilizing domain-specific prompt engineering, we apply RAG to efficiently harness multimodal data inputs from sensors in a wireless environment. Key pre-processing pipelines including image-to-text conversion, object detection, and distance calculations for multimodal RAG input from multi-sensor data are proposed to obtain a unified vector database crucial for optimizing LLMs in global wireless tasks. Our evaluation, conducted with OpenAI's GPT and Google's Gemini models, demonstrates an 8%, 8%, 10%, 7%, and 12% improvement in relevancy, faithfulness, completeness, similarity, and accuracy, respectively, compared to conventional LLM-based designs. Furthermore, our RAG-based LLM framework with vectorized databases is computationally efficient, providing real-time convergence under latency constraints.</p></details> | Accepted @ ICC 2025 | None |
| **[SP3D: Boosting Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection via Accurate Cross-Modal Semantic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06467v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, sparsely-supervised 3D object detection has gained great attention, achieving performance close to fully-supervised 3D objectors while requiring only a few annotated instances. Nevertheless, these methods suffer challenges when accurate labels are extremely absent. In this paper, we propose a boosting strategy, termed SP3D, explicitly utilizing the cross-modal semantic prompts generated from Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to boost the 3D detector with robust feature discrimination capability under sparse annotation settings. Specifically, we first develop a Confident Points Semantic Transfer (CPST) module that generates accurate cross-modal semantic prompts through boundary-constrained center cluster selection. Based on these accurate semantic prompts, which we treat as seed points, we introduce a Dynamic Cluster Pseudo-label Generation (DCPG) module to yield pseudo-supervision signals from the geometry shape of multi-scale neighbor points. Additionally, we design a Distribution Shape score (DS score) that chooses high-quality supervision signals for the initial training of the 3D detector. Experiments on the KITTI dataset and Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) have validated that SP3D can enhance the performance of sparsely supervised detectors by a large margin under meager labeling conditions. Moreover, we verified SP3D in the zero-shot setting, where its performance exceeded that of the state-of-the-art methods.

Existing approaches achieve this by connecting traditional 3D object detectors with vision-language models (VLMs) to regress 3D bounding boxes for novel objects and perform open-vocabulary classification through cross-modal alignment between 3D and 2D features. However, achieving robust cross-modal alignment remains a challenge due to semantic inconsistencies when generating corresponding 3D and 2D feature pairs. To overcome this challenge, we present OV-SCAN, an Open-Vocabulary 3D framework that enforces Semantically Consistent Alignment for Novel object discovery. OV-SCAN employs two core strategies: discovering precise 3D annotations and filtering out low-quality or corrupted alignment pairs (arising from 3D annotation, occlusion-induced, or resolution-induced noise). Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that OV-SCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods have explored different techniques, including CNN, deep learning, and Transformers, for object detection and video classification. However, detecting tiny objects, e.g., guns, in videos remains challenging due to their small scale and varying appearances in complex scenes. Moreover, existing video analysis models for classification or detection often perform poorly in real-world gun detection scenarios due to limited labeled video datasets for training. Thus, developing efficient methods for effectively capturing tiny object features and designing models capable of accurate gun detection in real-world videos is imperative. To address these challenges, we make three original contributions in this paper. First, we conduct an empirical study of several existing video classification and object detection methods to identify guns in videos. Our extensive analysis shows that these methods may not accurately detect guns in videos. Second, we propose a novel two-stage gun detection method. In stage 1, we train an image-augmented model to effectively classify ``Gun'' videos. To make the detection more precise and efficient, stage 2 employs an object detection model to locate the exact region of the gun within video frames for videos classified as ``Gun'' by stage 1. Third, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed domain-specific method achieves significant performance improvements and enhances efficiency compared with existing techniques. We also discuss challenges and future research directions in gun detection tasks in computer vision.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep models achieve strong performance, their efficiency remains a challenge. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique, but existing feature-based KD methods rely on static, teacher-driven feature selection, failing to adapt to the student's evolving learning state or leverage dynamic student-teacher interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive student-teacher Cooperative Attention Masking for Knowledge Distillation (ACAM-KD), which introduces two key components: (1) Student-Teacher Cross-Attention Feature Fusion (STCA-FF), which adaptively integrates features from both models for a more interactive distillation process, and (2) Adaptive Spatial-Channel Masking (ASCM), which dynamically generates importance masks to enhance both spatial and channel-wise feature selection. Unlike conventional KD methods, ACAM-KD adapts to the student's evolving needs throughout the entire distillation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. For instance, on COCO2017, ACAM-KD improves object detection performance by up to 1.4 mAP over the state-of-the-art when distilling a ResNet-50 student from a ResNet-101 teacher. For semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, it boosts mIoU by 3.09 over the baseline with DeepLabV3-MobileNetV2 as the student model.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 tables, 3 figures</p></details> | None |

To address this, we introduce the first generalized cross-domain few-shot (GCFS) task in 3D object detection, which focuses on adapting a source-pretrained model for high performance on both common and novel classes in a target domain with few-shot samples. Our solution integrates multi-modal fusion and contrastive-enhanced prototype learning within one framework, holistically overcoming challenges related to data scarcity and domain adaptation in the GCFS setting. The multi-modal fusion module utilizes 2D vision-language models to extract rich, open-set semantic knowledge. To address biases in point distributions across varying structural complexities, we particularly introduce a physically-aware box searching strategy that leverages laser imaging principles to generate high-quality 3D box proposals from 2D insights, enhancing object recall. To effectively capture domain-specific representations for each class from limited target data, we further propose a contrastive-enhanced prototype learning, which strengthens the model's adaptability. We evaluate our approach with three GCFS benchmark settings, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for GCFS tasks.

We formalize this overlooked yet critical editing paradigm as "Get-In-Video Editing", where users provide reference images to precisely specify visual elements they wish to incorporate into videos. Addressing this task's dual challenges, severe training data scarcity and technical challenges in maintaining spatiotemporal coherence, we introduce three key contributions.

Detecting their positions and orientations in X-ray fluoroscopic images is important for many clinical applications. Method: In this paper, a novel attention mechanism was designed to guide a convolution neural network (CNN) model to the areas of wires in X-ray images, as nearly all interventional devices and catheters used in cardiovascular procedures contain wires. The attention mechanism includes multi-scale Gaussian derivative filters and a dot-product-based attention layer. By utilizing the proposed attention mechanism, a lightweight foundation model can be created to detect multiple objects simultaneously with higher precision and real-time speed. Results: The proposed model was trained and tested on a total of 12,438 X-ray images. An accuracy of 0.88 was achieved for detecting an echo probe and 0.87 for detecting an artificial valve at 58 FPS. The accuracy was measured by intersection-over-union (IoU). We also achieved a 99.8% success rate in detecting a 10-electrode catheter and a 97.8% success rate in detecting an ablation catheter. Conclusion: Our detection foundation model can simultaneously detect and identify both interventional devices and flexible catheters in real-time X-ray fluoroscopic images.

Nonetheless, MIS inherently relies on indirect visualization and precise instrument control, posing unique challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled real-time surgical scene understanding through techniques such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, with scene reconstruction emerging as a key element for enhanced intraoperative guidance. Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have been explored for this purpose, their substantial data requirements and slow rendering inhibit real-time performance. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a more efficient alternative, achieving state-of-the-art performance in dynamic surgical scene reconstruction. In this work, we introduce Feature-EndoGaussian (FEG), an extension of 3DGS that integrates 2D segmentation cues into 3D rendering to enable real-time semantic and scene reconstruction. By leveraging pretrained segmentation foundation models, FEG incorporates semantic feature distillation within the Gaussian deformation framework, thereby enhancing both reconstruction fidelity and segmentation accuracy. On the EndoNeRF dataset, FEG achieves superior performance (SSIM of 0.97, PSNR of 39.08, and LPIPS of 0.03) compared to leading methods. Additionally, on the EndoVis18 dataset, FEG demonstrates competitive class-wise segmentation metrics while balancing model size and real-time performance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures | None |

Existing domain adaptation methods usually require retraining the model for new domains, which is impractical for agricultural applications due to constantly changing environments. In this paper, we propose DODA ($D$iffusion for $O$bject-detection $D$omain Adaptation in $A$griculture), a diffusion-based framework that can adapt the detector to a new domain in just 2 minutes. DODA incorporates external domain embeddings and an improved layout-to-image approach, allowing it to generate high-quality detection data for new domains without additional training. We demonstrate DODA's effectiveness on the Global Wheat Head Detection dataset, where fine-tuning detectors on DODA-generated data yields significant improvements across multiple domains.

In this paper, we propose SAM-COD that performs camouflaged object detection for RGB-D inputs. While keeping the SAM architecture intact, dual stream adapters are expanded on the image encoder to learn potential complementary information from RGB images and depth images, and fine-tune the mask decoder and its depth replica to perform dual-stream mask prediction. In practice, the dual stream adapters are embedded into the attention block of the image encoder in a parallel manner to facilitate the refinement and correction of the two types of image embeddings. To mitigate channel discrepancies arising from dual stream embeddings that do not directly interact with each other, we augment the association of dual stream embeddings using bidirectional knowledge distillation including a model distiller and a modal distiller. In addition, to predict the masks for RGB and depth attention maps, we hybridize the two types of image embeddings which are jointly learned with the prompt embeddings to update the initial prompt, and then feed them into the mask decoders to synchronize the consistency of image embeddings and prompt embeddings. Experimental results on four COD benchmarks show that our SAM-COD achieves excellent detection performance gains over SAM and achieves state-of-the-art results with a given fine-tuning paradigm.</p></details> |  | None |

Enhancing the performance of these models such as the transformer based Florence 2 on specialized tasks like object detection in complex and unstructured environments requires fine-tuning. The goal of this paper is to improve the efficiency of the Florence 2 model in challenging environments by finetuning it.

Two types of approaches to the problem have evolved: 1) Supervised and 2) optimization-based methods. Supervised methods are fast during inference and achieve high-quality results, however, they are limited by the need for large amounts of labeled training data and are susceptible to domain gaps. In contrast, unsupervised test-time optimization methods do not face the problem of domain gaps but usually suffer from substantial runtime, exhibit artifacts, or fail to converge to the right solution. In this work, we mitigate several limitations of existing optimization-based methods. To this end, we 1) introduce a simple voxel grid-based model that improves over the standard MLP-based formulation in multiple dimensions and 2) introduce a new multiframe loss formulation. 3) We combine both contributions in our new method, termed Floxels. On the Argoverse 2 benchmark, Floxels is surpassed only by EulerFlow among unsupervised methods while achieving comparable performance at a fraction of the computational cost. Floxels achieves a massive speedup of more than ~60 - 140x over EulerFlow, reducing the runtime from a day to 10 minutes per sequence.

This work introduces DEAL-YOLO, a novel approach that improves small object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images by using multi-objective loss functions like Wise IoU (WIoU) and Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD), which prioritize pixels near the centre of the bounding box, ensuring smoother localization and reducing abrupt deviations. Additionally, the model is optimized through efficient feature extraction with Linear Deformable (LD) convolutions, enhancing accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The Scaled Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) module enhances object detection by effectively capturing inter-scale relationships, improving feature representation, and boosting metrics through optimized multiscale fusion. Comparison with baseline models reveals high efficacy with up to 69.5\% fewer parameters compared to vanilla Yolov8-N, highlighting the robustness of the proposed modifications. Through this approach, our paper aims to facilitate the detection of endangered species, animal population analysis, habitat monitoring, biodiversity research, and various other applications that enrich wildlife conservation efforts.

However, in real-world scenarios where data arrives incrementally, neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to a loss of previously learned knowledge. To address this, prior research has explored strategies for Class Incremental Learning (CIL) in Continual Learning for Object Detection (CLOD), with most approaches focusing on two-stage object detectors. However, existing work suggests that Learning without Forgetting (LwF) may be ineffective for one-stage anchor-free detectors like YOLO due to noisy regression outputs, which risk transferring corrupted knowledge. In this work, we introduce YOLO LwF, a self-distillation approach tailored for YOLO-based continual object detection.

| **[A lightweight model FDM-YOLO for small target improvement based on YOLOv8](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04452v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small targets are particularly difficult to detect due to their low pixel count, complex backgrounds, and varying shooting angles, which make it hard for models to extract effective features. While some large-scale models offer high accuracy, their long inference times make them unsuitable for real-time deployment on edge devices. On the other hand, models designed for low computational power often suffer from poor detection accuracy. This paper focuses on small target detection and explores methods for object detection under low computational constraints. Building on the YOLOv8 model, we propose a new network architecture called FDM-YOLO. Our research includes the following key contributions: We introduce FDM-YOLO by analyzing the output of the YOLOv8 detection head. We add a highresolution layer and remove the large target detection layer to better handle small targets. Based on PConv, we propose a lightweight network structure called Fast-C2f, which is integrated into the PAN module of the model. To mitigate the accuracy loss caused by model lightweighting, we employ dynamic upsampling (Dysample) and a lightweight EMA attention mechanism.The FDM-YOLO model was validated on the Visdrone dataset, achieving a 38% reduction in parameter count and improving the Map0.5 score from 38.4% to 42.5%, all while maintaining nearly the same inference speed. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in balancing accuracy and efficiency for edge device deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Modulating CNN Features with Pre-Trained ViT Representations for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16981v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to large-scale image-text contrastive training, pre-trained vision language model (VLM) like CLIP shows superior open-vocabulary recognition ability. Most existing open-vocabulary object detectors attempt to utilize the pre-trained VLMs to attain generalized representation. F-ViT uses the pre-trained visual encoder as the backbone network and freezes it during training. However, its frozen backbone doesn't benefit from the labeled data to strengthen the representation for detection. Therefore, we propose a novel two-branch backbone network, named as \textbf{V}iT-Feature-\textbf{M}odulated Multi-Scale \textbf{C}onvolutional Network (VMCNet), which consists of a trainable convolutional branch, a frozen pre-trained ViT branch and a VMC module. The trainable CNN branch could be optimized with labeled data while the frozen pre-trained ViT branch could keep the representation ability derived from large-scale pre-training. Then, the proposed VMC module could modulate the multi-scale CNN features with the representations from ViT branch. With this proposed mixed structure, the detector is more likely to discover objects of novel categories. Evaluated on two popular benchmarks, our method boosts the detection performance on novel category and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On OV-COCO, the proposed method achieves 44.3 AP$_{50}^{\mathrm{novel}}$ with ViT-B/16 and 48.5 AP$_{50}^{\mathrm{novel}}$ with ViT-L/14. On OV-LVIS, VMCNet with ViT-B/16 and ViT-L/14 reaches 27.8 and 38.4 mAP$_{r}$.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Shaken, Not Stirred: A Novel Dataset for Visual Understanding of Glasses in Human-Robot Bartending Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04308v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datasets for object detection often do not account for enough variety of glasses, due to their transparent and reflective properties. Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue to robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. The paper introduces a novel method for the acquisition of real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The data set consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[MIAdapt: Source-free Few-shot Domain Adaptive Object Detection for Microscopic Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03370v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing generic unsupervised domain adaptation approaches require access to both a large labeled source dataset and a sufficient unlabeled target dataset during adaptation. However, collecting a large dataset, even if unlabeled, is a challenging and expensive endeavor, especially in medical imaging. In addition, constraints such as privacy issues can result in cases where source data is unavailable. Taking in consideration these challenges, we propose MIAdapt, an adaptive approach for Microscopic Imagery Adaptation as a solution for Source-free Few-shot Domain Adaptive Object detection (SF-FSDA). We also define two competitive baselines (1) Faster-FreeShot and (2) MT-FreeShot. Extensive experiments on the challenging M5-Malaria and Raabin-WBC datasets validate the effectiveness of MIAdapt. Without using any image from the source domain MIAdapt surpasses state-of-the-art source-free UDA (SF-UDA) methods by +21.3% mAP and few-shot domain adaptation (FSDA) approaches by +4.7% mAP on Raabin-WBC. Our code and models will be publicly available.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures | None |
