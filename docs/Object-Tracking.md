| **[GOT-JEPA: Generic Object Tracking with Model Adaptation and Occlusion Handling using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14771v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Learn...</summary><p>Learning Model Adaptation for Adverse and Dynamic Environments</p></details> | None |
| **[Offline-Poly: A Polyhedral Framework For Offline 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13772v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is a critical component of the 4D auto-labeling (4DAL) process. It enhances pseudo-labels generated by high-performance detectors through the incorporation of temporal context. However, existing offline 3D MOT approaches are direct extensions of online frameworks and fail to fully exploit the advantages of offline setting. Moreover, these methods often depend on fixed upstream and customized architectures, limiting their adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose Offline-Poly, a general offline 3D MOT method based on a tracking-centric design. We introduce a standardized paradigm termed Tracking-by-Tracking (TBT), which operates exclusively on arbitrary off-the-shelf tracking outputs and produces offline-refined tracklets. This formulation decouples offline tracker from specific upstream detectors or trackers. Under the TBT paradigm, Offline-Poly accepts one or multiple coarse tracking results and processes them through a structured pipeline comprising pre-processing, hierarchical matching and fusion, and tracklet refinement. Each module is designed to capitalize on the two fundamental properties of offline tracking: resource unconstrainedness, which permits global optimization beyond real-time limits, and future observability, which enables tracklet reasoning over the full temporal horizon. Offline-Poly first eliminates short-term ghost tracklets and re-identifies fragmented segments using global scene context. It then constructs scene-level similarity to associate tracklets across multiple input sources. Finally, Offline-Poly refines tracklets by jointly leveraging local and global motion patterns. On nuScenes, we achieve SOTA performance with 77.6% AMOTA. On KITTI, it achieves leading results with 83.00% HOTA. Comprehensive experiments further validate the flexibility, generalizability, and modular effectiveness of Offline-Poly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on this work, we achieved 1st place on the KITTI tracking leaderboard</p></details> | None |
| **[Layer-Guided UAV Tracking: Enhancing Efficiency and Occlusion Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13636v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object tracking (VOT) plays a pivotal role in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. Addressing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, especially under challenging conditions like unpredictable occlusion, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces LGTrack, a unified UAV tracking framework that integrates dynamic layer selection, efficient feature enhancement, and robust representation learning for occlusions. By employing a novel lightweight Global-Grouped Coordinate Attention (GGCA) module, LGTrack captures long-range dependencies and global contexts, enhancing feature discriminability with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, a lightweight Similarity-Guided Layer Adaptation (SGLA) module replaces knowledge distillation, achieving an optimal balance between tracking precision and inference efficiency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate LGTrack's state-of-the-art real-time speed (258.7 FPS on UAVDT) while maintaining competitive tracking accuracy (82.8\% precision).

| **[Detecting Object Tracking Failure via Sequential Hypothesis Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12983v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time online object tracking in videos constitutes a core task in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications including video surveillance, motion capture, and robotics. Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in WACV workshop "Real World Surveillance: Applications and Challenges, 6th"</p></details> | None |
| **[Easy-Poly: An Easy Polyhedral Framework For 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17822v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent 3D multi-object tracking (3D MOT) methods mainly follow tracking-by-detection pipelines, but often suffer from high false positives, missed detections, and identity switches, especially in crowded and small-object scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Easy-Poly, a filter-based 3D MOT framework with four key innovations: (1) CNMSMM, a novel Camera-LiDAR fusion detection method combining multi-modal augmentation and an efficient NMS with a new loss function to improve small target detection; (2) Dynamic Track-Oriented (DTO) data association that robustly handles uncertainties and occlusions via class-aware optimal assignment and parallel processing strategies; (3) Dynamic Motion Modeling (DMM) using a confidence-weighted Kalman filter with adaptive noise covariance to enhance tracking accuracy; and (4) an extended life-cycle management system reducing identity switches and false terminations. Experimental results show that Easy-Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Poly-MOT and Fast-Poly, achieving notable gains in mAP (e.g., from 63.30% to 65.65% with LargeKernel3D) and AMOTA (e.g., from 73.1% to 75.6%), while also running in real-time. Our framework advances robustness and adaptability in complex driving environments, paving the way for safer autonomous driving perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates. The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable. Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers.

| **[Beyond Vizing Chains: Improved Recourse in Dynamic Edge Coloring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09497v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the maintenance of a $(Δ+C)$-edge-coloring ($C\ge 1$) in a fully dynamic graph $G$ with maximum degree $Δ$. We focus on minimizing \emph{recourse} which equals the number of recolored edges per edge updates. We present a new technique based on an object which we call a \emph{shift-tree}. This object tracks multiple possible recolorings of $G$ and enables us to maintain a proper coloring with small recourse in polynomial time. We shift colors over a path of edges, but unlike many other algorithms, we do not use \emph{fans} and \emph{alternating bicolored paths}. We combine the shift-tree with additional techniques to obtain an algorithm with a \emph{tight} recourse of $O\big( \frac{\log n}{\log \frac{Δ+C}{Δ-C}}\big)$ for all $C \ge 0.62Δ$ where $Δ-C = O(n^{1-δ})$. Our algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm to establish tight bounds for large palettes, and the first to do so when $Δ-C=o(Δ)$. This result settles the theoretical complexity of the recourse for large palettes. Furthermore, we believe that viewing the possible shifts as a tree can lead to similar tree-based techniques that extend to lower values of $C$, and to improved update times. A second application is to graphs with low arboricity $α$. Previous works [BCPS24, CRV24] achieve $O(ε^{-1}\log n)$ recourse per update with $C\ge (4+ε)α$, and we improve by achieving the same recourse while only requiring $C \ge (2+ε)α- 1$. This result is $Δ$-adaptive, i.e., it uses $Δ_t+C$ colors where $Δ_t$ is the current maximum degree. Trying to understand the limitations of our technique, and shift-based algorithms in general, we show a separation between the recourse achievable by algorithms that only shift colors along a path, and more general algorithms such as ones using the Nibbling Method [BGW21, BCPS24].</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ReaMOT: A Benchmark and Framework for Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20381v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track targets specified by language instructions. However, existing RMOT paradigms are largely designed for explicit instructions and consequently fail to generalize to complex instructions that require logical reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT), a novel task that requires models to identify and track targets that satisfy implicit constraints via logical reasoning. To advance this field, we construct the ReaMOT Challenge, a comprehensive benchmark comprising: (1) a large-scale dataset with 1,156 instructions categorized into High-Level Reasoning and Low-Level Perception, covering 423,359 image-language pairs across 869 diverse scenes; and (2) a tailored metric suite designed to jointly evaluate reasoning accuracy and tracking robustness. Furthermore, we propose ReaTrack, a training-free framework that synergizes the reasoning capabilities of Thinking-variant Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) with the precise temporal modeling of SAM2. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/chen-si-jia/ReaMOT</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/chen-si-jia/ReaMOT) |
| **[GOT-Edit: Geometry-Aware Generic Object Tracking via Online Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08550v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026.

| **[View-Centric Multi-Object Tracking with Homographic Matching in Moving UAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10830v3)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the challenge of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in moving Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) scenarios, where irregular flight trajectories, such as hovering, turning left/right, and moving up/down, lead to significantly greater complexity compared to fixed-camera MOT. Specifically, changes in the scene background not only render traditional frame-to-frame object IoU association methods ineffective but also introduce significant view shifts in the objects, which complicates tracking. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel HomView-MOT framework, which for the first time, harnesses the view homography inherent in changing scenes to solve MOT challenges in moving environments, incorporating homographic matching and view-centric concepts. We introduce a Fast Homography Estimation (FHE) algorithm for rapid computation of homography matrices between video frames, enabling object View-Centric ID Learning (VCIL) and leveraging multi-view homography to learn cross-view ID features. Concurrently, our Homographic Matching Filter (HMF) maps object bounding boxes from different frames onto a common view plane for a more realistic physical IoU association. Extensive experiments have proven that these innovations allow HomView-MOT to achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent UAV MOT datasets VisDrone and UAVDT.</p></details> | TGRS 2026 | None |

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a physical environment indirect prompt injection attack that exploits the multimodal language interpretation abilities of AI models. CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents: drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML).

| **[MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12924v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enriching physical-virtual interaction in AR gaming by tracking identical objects via an egocentric partial observation frame](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17399v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented reality (AR) games, particularly those designed for head-mounted displays, have grown increasingly prevalent. However, most existing systems depend on pre-scanned, static environments and rely heavily on continuous tracking or marker-based solutions, which limit adaptability in dynamic physical spaces. This is particularly problematic for AR headsets and glasses, which typically follow the user's head movement and cannot maintain a fixed, stationary view of the scene. Moreover, continuous scene observation is neither power-efficient nor practical for wearable devices, given their limited battery and processing capabilities. A persistent challenge arises when multiple identical objects are present in the environment-standard object tracking pipelines often fail to maintain consistent identities without uninterrupted observation or external sensors. These limitations hinder fluid physical-virtual interactions, especially in dynamic or occluded scenes where continuous tracking is infeasible. To address this, we introduce a novel optimization-based framework for re-identifying identical objects in AR scenes using only one partial egocentric observation frame captured by a headset. We formulate the problem as a label assignment task solved via integer programming, augmented with a Voronoi diagram-based pruning strategy to improve computational efficiency. This method reduces computation time by 50% while preserving 91% accuracy in simulated experiments. Moreover, we evaluated our approach in quantitative synthetic and quantitative real-world experiments. We also conducted three qualitative real-world experiments to demonstrate the practical utility and generalizability for enabling dynamic, markerless object interaction in AR environments.

Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, and MOTE. Extensive evaluations show up to 53\% reduction in identity switches and 12\% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7\% MOTA on SportsMOT.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DRMOT: A Dataset and Framework for RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04692v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dictionary Learning under Symmetries via Group Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19557v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dictionary learning problem can be viewed as a data-driven process to learn a suitable transformation so that data is sparsely represented directly from example data. In this paper, we examine the problem of learning a dictionary that is invariant under a pre-specified group of transformations. Natural settings include Cryo-EM, multi-object tracking, synchronization, pose estimation, etc. We specifically study this problem under the lens of mathematical representation theory. Leveraging the power of non-abelian Fourier analysis for functions over compact groups, we prescribe an algorithmic recipe for learning dictionaries that obey such invariances. We relate the dictionary learning problem in the physical domain, which is naturally modelled as being infinite dimensional, with the associated computational problem, which is necessarily finite dimensional. We establish that the dictionary learning problem can be effectively understood as an optimization instance over certain matrix orbitopes having a particular block-diagonal structure governed by the irreducible representations of the group of symmetries. This perspective enables us to introduce a band-limiting procedure which obtains dimensionality reduction in applications. We provide guarantees for our computational ansatz to provide a desirable dictionary learning outcome. We apply our paradigm to investigate the dictionary learning problem for the groups SO(2) and SO(3). While the SO(2)-orbitope admits an exact spectrahedral description, substantially less is understood about the SO(3)-orbitope. We describe a tractable spectrahedral outer approximation of the SO(3)-orbitope, and contribute an alternating minimization paradigm to perform optimization in this setting. We provide numerical experiments to highlight the efficacy of our approach in learning SO(3)-invariant dictionaries, both on synthetic and on real world data.</p></details> | 33 pages, 3 figures | None |

While deep learning-based solutions have demonstrated impressive 3D MOT performance, model-based approaches remain appealing for their simplicity, interpretability, and data efficiency. Conventional model-based trackers typically rely on random vector-based Bayesian filters within the tracking-by-detection (TBD) framework but face limitations due to heuristic data association and track management schemes. In contrast, random finite set (RFS)-based Bayesian filtering handles object birth, survival, and death in a theoretically sound manner, facilitating interpretability and parameter tuning. In this paper, we present OptiPMB, a novel RFS-based 3D MOT method that employs an optimized Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter while incorporating several key innovative designs within the TBD framework. Specifically, we propose a measurement-driven hybrid adaptive birth model for improved track initialization, employ adaptive detection probability parameters to effectively maintain tracks for occluded objects, and optimize density pruning and track extraction modules to further enhance overall tracking performance. Extensive evaluations on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show that OptiPMB achieves superior tracking accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, thereby establishing a new benchmark for model-based 3D MOT and offering valuable insights for future research on RFS-based trackers in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods remain challenged in dynamic environments, where moving objects violate the static-world assumption and introduce inconsistent observations that degrade both camera tracking and map reconstruction. This motivates two fundamental problems: robustly identifying dynamic objects and modeling them online. To address these limitations, we propose CAD-SLAM, a Consistency-Aware Dynamic SLAM framework with dynamic-static decoupled mapping. Our key insight is that dynamic objects inherently violate cross-view and cross-time scene consistency. We detect object motion by analyzing geometric and texture discrepancies between historical map renderings and real-world observations. Once a moving object is identified, we perform bidirectional dynamic object tracking (both backward and forward in time) to achieve complete sequence-wise dynamic recognition. Our consistency-aware dynamic detection model achieves category-agnostic, instantaneous dynamic identification, which effectively mitigates motion-induced interference during localization and mapping. In addition, we introduce a dynamic-static decoupled mapping strategy that employs a temporal Gaussian model for online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate the flexible and accurate dynamic segmentation capabilities of our method, along with the state-of-the-art performance in both localization and mapping.</p></details> |  | None |

These difficulties are further exacerbated by the geometric distortion and extreme scale variation introduced by static fisheye cameras. In this work, we present GTATrack, a hierarchical tracking framework that win first place in the SoccerTrack Challenge 2025. GTATrack integrates two core components: Deep Expansion IoU (Deep-EIoU) for motion-agnostic online association and Global Tracklet Association (GTA) for trajectory-level refinement. This two-stage design enables both robust short-term matching and long-term identity consistency. Additionally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is used to boost detector recall on small and distorted targets. The synergy between local association and global reasoning effectively addresses identity switches, occlusions, and tracking fragmentation.

While end-to-end methods have gained significant interest in single-camera tracking, multi-camera tracking remains predominantly reliant on heuristic techniques. In response to this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Camera Tracking tRansformer (MCTR), a novel end-to-end approach tailored for multi-object detection and tracking across multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view. MCTR leverages end-to-end detectors like DEtector TRansformer (DETR) to produce detections and detection embeddings independently for each camera view. The framework maintains set of track embeddings that encaplusate global information about the tracked objects, and updates them at every frame by integrating the local information from the view-specific detection embeddings. The track embeddings are probabilistically associated with detections in every camera view and frame to generate consistent object tracks. The soft probabilistic association facilitates the design of differentiable losses that enable end-to-end training of the entire system. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on MMPTrack and AI City Challenge, two recently introduced large-scale multi-camera multi-object tracking datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Visual Localization via Semantic Structures in Autonomous Photovoltaic Power Plant Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14587v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspection systems utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with thermal cameras are increasingly popular for the maintenance of photovoltaic (PV) power plants. However, automation of the inspection task is a challenging problem as it requires precise navigation to capture images from optimal distances and viewing angles. This paper presents a novel localization pipeline that directly integrates PV module detection with UAV navigation, allowing precise positioning during inspection. The detections are used to identify the power plant structures in the image. These are associated with the power plant model and used to infer the UAV position relative to the inspected PV installation. We define visually recognizable anchor points for the initial association and use object tracking to discern global associations. Additionally, we present three different methods for visual segmentation of PV modules and evaluate their performance in relation to the proposed localization pipeline. The presented methods were verified and evaluated using custom aerial inspection data sets, demonstrating their robustness and applicability for real-time navigation.

| **[AI-Driven Three-Dimensional Reconstruction and Quantitative Analysis for Burn Injury Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00113v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, reproducible burn assessment is critical for treatment planning, healing monitoring, and medico-legal documentation, yet conventional visual inspection and 2D photography are subjective and limited for longitudinal comparison. This paper presents an AI-enabled burn assessment and management platform that integrates multi-view photogrammetry, 3D surface reconstruction, and deep learning-based segmentation within a structured clinical workflow. Using standard multi-angle images from consumer-grade cameras, the system reconstructs patient-specific 3D burn surfaces and maps burn regions onto anatomy to compute objective metrics in real-world units, including surface area, TBSA, depth-related geometric proxies, and volumetric change. Successive reconstructions are spatially aligned to quantify healing progression over time, enabling objective tracking of wound contraction and depth reduction. The platform also supports structured patient intake, guided image capture, 3D analysis and visualization, treatment recommendations, and automated report generation. Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates stable reconstructions, consistent metric computation, and clinically plausible longitudinal trends, supporting a scalable, non-invasive approach to objective, geometry-aware burn assessment and decision support in acute and outpatient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages and 5 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[UBATrack: Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for General Multi-Modal Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14799v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16M QA pairs over 270K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, with near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Oral). project page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa) |
| **[Molmo2: Open Weights and Data for Vision-Language Models with Video Understanding and Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10611v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DeTracker: Motion-decoupled Vehicle Detection and Tracking in Unstabilized Satellite Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09240v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Reliable Spatiotemporal Dependencies for Efficient Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09078v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in transformer-based lightweight object tracking have established new standards across benchmarks, leveraging the global receptive field and powerful feature extraction capabilities of attention mechanisms. Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU).</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[LLMTrack: Semantic Multi-Object Tracking with Multi-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06550v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) systems have achieved remarkable precision in localization and association, effectively answering \textit{where} and \textit{who}. However, they often function as autistic observers, capable of tracing geometric paths but blind to the semantic \textit{what} and \textit{why} behind object behaviors. To bridge the gap between geometric perception and cognitive reasoning, we propose \textbf{LLMTrack}, a novel end-to-end framework for Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT). We adopt a bionic design philosophy that decouples strong localization from deep understanding, utilizing Grounding DINO as the eyes and the LLaVA-OneVision multimodal large model as the brain. We introduce a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module that aggregates instance-level interaction features and video-level contexts, enabling the Large Language Model (LLM) to comprehend complex trajectories. Furthermore, we design a progressive three-stage training strategy, Visual Alignment, Temporal Fine-tuning, and Semantic Injection via LoRA to efficiently adapt the massive model to the tracking domain. Extensive experiments on the BenSMOT benchmark demonstrate that LLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in instance description, interaction recognition, and video summarization while maintaining robust tracking stability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Perception Test 2025: Challenge Summary and a Unified VQA Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06287v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Third Perception Test challenge was organised as a full-day workshop alongside the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025. Its primary goal is to benchmark state-of-the-art video models and measure the progress in multimodal perception. This year, the workshop featured 2 guest tracks as well: KiVA (an image understanding challenge) and Physic-IQ (a video generation challenge). In this report, we summarise the results from the main Perception Test challenge, detailing both the existing tasks as well as novel additions to the benchmark. In this iteration, we placed an emphasis on task unification, as this poses a more challenging test for current SOTA multimodal models. The challenge included five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object and point tracking, unified action and sound localisation, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA, alongside an analysis and interpretability track that is still open for submissions. Notably, the unified video QA track introduced a novel subset that reformulates traditional perception tasks (such as point tracking and temporal action localisation) as multiple-choice video QA questions that video-language models can natively tackle. The unified object and point tracking merged the original object tracking and point tracking tasks, whereas the unified action and sound localisation merged the original temporal action localisation and temporal sound localisation tracks. Accordingly, we required competitors to use unified approaches rather than engineered pipelines with task-specific models. By proposing such a unified challenge, Perception Test 2025 highlights the significant difficulties existing models face when tackling diverse perception tasks through unified interfaces.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings. We evaluate our method through qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted in a real 3D environment using a TIAGo robot. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOST-3DSG in dynamic object tracking. Code and supplementary material are publicly available on the project website at https://lab-rococo-sapienza.github.io/lost-3dsg/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://lab-rococo-sapienza.github.io/lost-3dsg) |
| **[CT Scans As Video: Efficient Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Using Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02521v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated analysis of volumetric medical imaging on edge devices is severely constrained by the high memory and computational demands of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AR-MOT: Autoregressive Multi-object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01925v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks continue to evolve toward more general and multi-modal scenarios, the rigid and task-specific architectures of existing MOT methods increasingly hinder their applicability across diverse tasks and limit flexibility in adapting to new tracking formulations. Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments on MOT17 and DanceTrack validate the feasibility of our approach, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while laying the foundation for more general and flexible MOT systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Decoupling Amplitude and Phase Attention in Frequency Domain for RGB-Event based Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01022v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing RGB-Event visual object tracking approaches primarily rely on conventional feature-level fusion, failing to fully exploit the unique advantages of event cameras. In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method.

| **[CropTrack: A Tracking with Re-Identification Framework for Precision Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24838v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://marwan99.github.io/kv_tracker</p></details> | [Code Link](https://marwan99.github.io/kv_tracker) |

Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SPOT!: Map-Guided LLM Agent for Unsupervised Multi-CCTV Dynamic Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20975v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.</p></details> | 33 pages, 27figures | None |

While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a systematic failure analysis of longitudinal safety controllers under object based LiDAR attacks in highway driving scenarios. The study focuses on realistic cut in and car following situations in which adversarial objects introduce persistent perception errors without directly modifying vehicle control software. A high fidelity simulation framework integrating LiDAR perception, object tracking, and closed loop vehicle control is used to evaluate how false and displaced object detections propagate through the perception planning and control pipeline. The results demonstrate that even short duration LiDAR induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed responses to real hazards, and unstable control behavior. In cut in scenarios, a clear increase in unsafe deceleration events and time to collision violations is observed when compared to benign conditions, despite identical controller parameters. The analysis further shows that controller failures are more strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone. These findings reveal a critical gap between perception robustness and control level safety guarantees in autonomous driving systems. By explicitly characterizing safety controller failure modes under adversarial perception, this work provides practical insights for the design of attack aware safety mechanisms and more resilient control strategies for LiDAR dependent autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) HOP, a Hand-Object Planner, which can synthesize diverse hand-object trajectories; and (2) HOT, a Hand-Object Tracker that bridges synthetic-to-physical transfer through reinforcement learning and interaction imitation learning, delivering a generalizable controller conditioned on target hand-object states. Our method extends to diverse object shapes and hand morphologies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our approach enables dexterous hands to track challenging, long-horizon sequences including object re-arrangement and agile in-hand reorientation.

The methodology is thus for joint tracking and intent recognition. Several latent intent models are proposed here within a virtual leader formulation. They capture the influence of the target's hidden goal on its instantaneous behaviour. In this context, various motion models, including for highly maneuvering objects, are also considered. The a priori unknown target intent (e.g. destination) can dynamically change over time and take any value within the state space (e.g. a location or spatial region). A sequential Monte Carlo (particle filtering) approach is introduced for the simultaneous estimation of the target's (kinematic) state and its intent. Rao-Blackwellisation is employed to enhance the statistical performance of the inference routine. Simulated data and real radar measurements are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (T-AES)</p></details> | None |

However, existing formulations assume an "offline" setting with full video access at query time, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios with power and storage-constrained wearable devices. Towards more application-ready episodic memory systems, we introduce Online Visual Query 2D (OVQ2D), a task where models process video streams online, observing each frame only once, and retrieve object localizations using a compact memory instead of full video history. We address OVQ2D with ESOM (Egocentric Streaming Object Memory), a novel framework integrating an object discovery module, an object tracking module, and a memory module that find, track, and store spatio-temporal object information for efficient querying. Experiments on Ego4D demonstrate ESOM's superiority over other online approaches, though OVQ2D remains challenging, with top performance at only ~4% success. ESOM's accuracy increases markedly with perfect object tracking (31.91%), discovery (40.55%), or both (81.92%), underscoring the need of applied research on these components.</p></details> | <details><summary>in IE...</summary><p>in IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Application of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026</p></details> | None |

This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments. We hope this survey serves as a reference, facilitating the adoption of event-based vision across diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CSUR,35 pages</p></details> | None |

High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures | None |

In this article, we propose a deterministic closed-form elliptical extended object tracker, based on decoupling of the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths. By disregarding potential correlations between these state components, fewer approximations are required for the individual estimators than for an overall joint solution. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. This is validated both by a simulation study using common models from literature, as well as an extensive quantitative evaluation on real automotive radar data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems</p></details> | None |

Inspired by query-based tracking frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VISAPP 2026</p></details> | None |

RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LeafTrackNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Robust Leaf Tracking in Top-Down Plant Phenotyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13130v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High resolution phenotyping at the level of individual leaves offers fine-grained insights into plant development and stress responses. However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping.

Existing high-performing methods often rely on pre-captured object views to build explicit reference models, which restricts them to a fixed set of known objects. However, such reference models can struggle with visually complex appearance, reducing the quality of tracking. In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers in these difficult cases, paving the way toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.

The system reconstructs binary event frames using run-length encoding, generates region proposals, and adaptively switches between frame mode and event mode based on object size and velocity. A Fast Object Tracking Unit improves robustness for high-speed targets through adaptive thresholding and trajectory-based classification. The neural processing unit supports both grayscale-patch and trajectory inference with a custom instruction set and a zero-skipping MAC architecture, reducing redundant neural computations by more than 97 percent. Implemented in 40 nm CMOS technology, the 2 mm^2 chip achieves 96 pJ per frame per pixel and 61 pJ per event at 0.8 V, and reaches 98.2 percent recognition accuracy on public UAV datasets across 50 to 400 m ranges and 5 to 80 pixels per second speeds.

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes.

This necessitates the transfer of intermediate feature data between the two halves. Here, effective compression of the feature data becomes vital. In this paper, we employ Z-score normalization to efficiently recover the compressed feature data at the decoder side. To examine the efficacy of our method, the proposed method is integrated into the latest Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) codec standard under development by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). Our method supersedes the existing scaling method used by the current standard under development. It both reduces the overhead bits and improves the end-task accuracy. To further reduce the overhead in certain circumstances, we also propose a simplified method. Experiments show that using our proposed method shows 17.09% reduction in bitrate on average across different tasks and up to 65.69% for object tracking without sacrificing the task accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, "in-the-wild" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation.

A Million-Scale Benchmark and New Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07385v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer wide-ranging applications but also pose significant safety and privacy violation risks in areas like airport and infrastructure inspection, spurring the rapid development of Anti-UAV technologies in recent years. However, current Anti-UAV research primarily focuses on RGB, infrared (IR), or RGB-IR videos captured by fixed ground cameras, with little attention to tracking target UAVs from another moving UAV platform. To fill this gap, we propose a new multi-modal visual tracking task termed UAV-Anti-UAV, which involves a pursuer UAV tracking a target adversarial UAV in the video stream. Compared to existing Anti-UAV tasks, UAV-Anti-UAV is more challenging due to severe dual-dynamic disturbances caused by the rapid motion of both the capturing platform and the target. To advance research in this domain, we construct a million-scale dataset consisting of 1,810 videos, each manually annotated with bounding boxes, a language prompt, and 15 tracking attributes. Furthermore, we propose MambaSTS, a Mamba-based baseline method for UAV-Anti-UAV tracking, which enables integrated spatial-temporal-semantic learning. Specifically, we employ Mamba and Transformer models to learn global semantic and spatial features, respectively, and leverage the state space model's strength in long-sequence modeling to establish video-level long-term context via a temporal token propagation mechanism. We conduct experiments on the UAV-Anti-UAV dataset to validate the effectiveness of our method. A thorough experimental evaluation of 50 modern deep tracking algorithms demonstrates that there is still significant room for improvement in the UAV-Anti-UAV domain.

Existing approaches, however, have largely focused on the simpler setting of homogeneous, dense prediction tasks, leaving the more realistic challenge of learning from structurally diverse tasks unexplored. To this end, we introduce NexusFlow, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play framework effective in both settings. NexusFlow introduces a set of surrogate networks with invertible coupling layers to align the latent feature distributions of tasks, creating a unified representation that enables effective knowledge transfer. The coupling layers are bijective, preserving information while mapping features into a shared canonical space. This invertibility avoids representational collapse and enables alignment across structurally different tasks without reducing expressive capacity. We first evaluate NexusFlow on the core challenge of domain-partitioned autonomous driving, where dense map reconstruction and sparse multi-object tracking are supervised in different geographic regions, creating both structural disparity and a strong domain gap. NexusFlow sets a new state-of-the-art result on nuScenes, outperforming strong partially supervised baselines. To demonstrate generality, we further test NexusFlow on NYUv2 using three homogeneous dense prediction tasks, segmentation, depth, and surface normals, as a representative N-task PS-MTL scenario. NexusFlow yields consistent gains across all tasks, confirming its broad applicability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures | None |

We evaluate our algorithm on simulated scenarios to understand its sensitivity to scenario aspects and model hyperparameters. Across varied scenario complexities, our method compares favorably to a strong baseline.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, as battery energy densities continue to rise, improper handling during recycling poses significant safety hazards, including potential fires at recycling facilities. Numerous systems have been proposed for battery detection and removal from WEEE recycling lines, including X-ray and RGB-based visual inspection methods, typically driven by AI-powered object detection models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, YOLO, ResNets). Despite advances in optimizing detection techniques and model modifications, a fully autonomous solution capable of accurately identifying and sorting batteries across diverse WEEEs types has yet to be realized. In response to these challenges, we present our novel approach which integrates a specialized X-ray transmission dual energy imaging subsystem with advanced pre-processing algorithms, enabling high-contrast image reconstruction for effective differentiation of dense and thin materials in WEEE. Devices move along a conveyor belt through a high-resolution X-ray imaging system, where YOLO and U-Net models precisely detect and segment battery-containing items. An intelligent tracking and position estimation algorithm then guides a Delta robot equipped with a suction gripper to selectively extract and properly discard the targeted devices. The approach is validated in a photorealistic simulation environment developed in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on the real setup.</p></details> |  | None |

While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions. These findings show that consumer-grade devices can reliably capture signals, and that neural decoding in music could be feasible in real-world settings. This paves the way for applications in education, personalized music technologies, and therapeutic interventions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Test-Time 3D Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08485v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised 3D occupancy prediction offers a promising solution for understanding complex driving scenes without requiring costly 3D annotations. However, training dense occupancy decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and once trained, such models struggle to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or novel object categories without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-Occ. Our method incrementally constructs, optimizes and voxelizes time-aware 3D Gaussians from raw sensor streams by integrating vision foundation models (VFMs) at runtime. The flexible nature of 3D Gaussians allows voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolutions, while the generalization ability of VFMs enables accurate perception and open-vocabulary recognition, without any network training or fine-tuning. Specifically, TT-Occ operates in a lift-track-voxelize symphony: We first lift the geometry and semantics of surrounding-view extracted from VFMs to instantiate Gaussians at 3D space; Next, we track dynamic Gaussians while accumulating static ones to complete the scene and enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we voxelize the optimized Gaussians to generate occupancy prediction. Optionally, inherent noise in VFM predictions and tracking is mitigated by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, we offer two variants: one LiDAR-based and one vision-centric, and conduct extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft benchmarks with varying voxel resolutions.</p></details> |  | None |

While these models promise precise and personalized control, they also introduce new safety risks when model outputs are delivered directly to neural tissue. We propose a systematic, quantitative approach to detect and characterize unsafe stimulation patterns in ML-driven neurostimulation systems. Approach: We adapt an automated software testing technique known as coverage-guided fuzzing to the domain of neural stimulation. Here, fuzzing performs stress testing by perturbing model inputs and tracking whether resulting stimulation violates biophysical limits on charge density, instantaneous current, or electrode co-activation. The framework treats encoders as black boxes and steers exploration with coverage metrics that quantify how broadly test cases span the space of possible outputs and violation types. Main results: Applied to deep stimulus encoders for the retina and cortex, the method systematically reveals diverse stimulation regimes that exceed established safety limits. Two violation-output coverage metrics identify the highest number and diversity of unsafe outputs, enabling interpretable comparisons across architectures and training strategies.

Our method, EulerFlow, optimizes this neural prior estimate against several multi-observation reconstruction objectives, enabling high quality scene flow estimation via pure self-supervision on real-world data. EulerFlow works out-of-the-box without tuning across multiple domains, including large-scale autonomous driving scenes and dynamic tabletop settings. Remarkably, EulerFlow produces high quality flow estimates on small, fast moving objects like birds and tennis balls, and exhibits emergent 3D point tracking behavior by solving its estimated ODE over long-time horizons. On the Argoverse 2 2024 Scene Flow Challenge, EulerFlow outperforms all prior art, surpassing the next-best unsupervised method by more than 2.5x, and even exceeding the next-best supervised method by over 10%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Two-Stage Camera Calibration Method for Multi-Camera Systems Using Scene Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05171v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calibration of multi-camera systems is a key task for accurate object tracking. However, it remains a challenging problem in real-world conditions, where traditional methods are not applicable due to the lack of accurate floor plans, physical access to place calibration patterns, or synchronized video streams. This paper presents a novel two-stage calibration method that overcomes these limitations. In the first stage, partial calibration of individual cameras is performed based on an operator's annotation of natural geometric primitives (parallel, perpendicular, and vertical lines, or line segments of equal length). This allows estimating key parameters (roll, pitch, focal length) and projecting the camera's Effective Field of View (EFOV) onto the horizontal plane in a base 3D coordinate system. In the second stage, precise system calibration is achieved through interactive manipulation of the projected EFOV polygons. The operator adjusts their position, scale, and rotation to align them with the floor plan or, in its absence, using virtual calibration elements projected onto all cameras in the system. This determines the remaining extrinsic parameters (camera position and yaw). Calibration requires only a static image from each camera, eliminating the need for physical access or synchronized video. The method is implemented as a practical web service. Comparative analysis and demonstration videos confirm the method's applicability, accuracy, and flexibility, enabling the deployment of precise multi-camera tracking systems in scenarios previously considered infeasible.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On Disturbance-Aware Minimum-Time Trajectory Planning: Evidence from Tests on a Dynamic Driving Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04917v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates how disturbance-aware, robustness-embedded reference trajectories translate into driving performance when executed by professional drivers in a dynamic simulator. Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

We present a novel multi-video 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach designed to handle real-world, unsynchronized video sets. Our approach, SyncTrack4D, directly leverages dense 4D track representation of dynamic scene parts as cues for simultaneous cross-video synchronization and 4DGS reconstruction. We first compute dense per-video 4D feature tracks and cross-video track correspondences by Fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport approach. Next, we perform global frame-level temporal alignment to maximize overlapping motion of matched 4D tracks. Finally, we achieve sub-frame synchronization through our multi-video 4D Gaussian splatting built upon a motion-spline scaffold representation. The final output is a synchronized 4DGS representation with dense, explicit 3D trajectories, and temporal offsets for each video. We evaluate our approach on the Panoptic Studio and SyncNeRF Blender, demonstrating sub-frame synchronization accuracy with an average temporal error below 0.26 frames, and high-fidelity 4D reconstruction reaching 26.3 PSNR scores on the Panoptic Studio dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first general 4D Gaussian Splatting approach for unsynchronized video sets, without assuming the existence of predefined scene objects or prior models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluating Long-Context Reasoning in LLM-Based WebAgents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04307v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly integrated into daily digital interactions, their ability to reason across long interaction histories becomes crucial for providing personalized and contextually aware assistance. However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted NeurIPS 25 LAW Workshop</p></details> | None |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance for this problem, but costly graph construction, irregular computations, and random memory access patterns substantially limit their throughput. The recently proposed Hashing-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT) offers a theoretically guaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its evaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object condensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step (e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime. In this work, we make two contributions. First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking performance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same dataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a lightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts track assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular, hardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference. On the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event on an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency. These results position HEPTv2 as a practical, scalable alternative to GNN-based pipelines for fast tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop</p></details> | None |

We introduce ExOAR (Expert-Guided Object and Activity Recognition), an interactive method that combines large language models (LLMs) with human verification to identify objects and activities from textual data. ExOAR guides users through consecutive stages in which an LLM generates candidate object types, activities, and object instances based on contextual input, such as a user's profession, and textual data. Users review and refine these suggestions before proceeding to the next stage. Implemented as a practical tool, ExOAR is initially validated through a demonstration and then evaluated with real-world Active Window Tracking data from five users. Our results show that ExOAR can effectively bridge the gap between unstructured textual data and the structured log with clear semantics needed for object-centric process analysis, while it maintains flexibility and human oversight.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript (on August 22, 2025) to the 2nd International Workshop on Generative AI for Process Mining (GenAI4PM 2025), held in conjunction with the 7th International Conference on Process Mining (ICPM 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Delving into Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency for Robust 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11323v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Motion4D: Learning 3D-Consistent Motion and Semantics for 4D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03601v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models for 2D vision have substantially improved the analysis of dynamic scenes from monocular videos. However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, these models often lack 3D consistency, a fundamental requirement for understanding scene geometry and motion, thereby causing severe spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our Motion4D significantly outperforms both 2D foundation models and existing 3D-based approaches across diverse scene understanding tasks, including point-based tracking, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

While task-space planning and control have been extensively studied for larger, arm-scale manipulators, demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in compact, multi-DoF robotic fingers remain scarce. In this paper, we present the physical prototyping and experimental characterization of a three-degree-of-freedom, linkage-driven, series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and a closed-form Jacobian. A resolved motion rate control (RMRC) scheme is implemented to achieve closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking. We experimentally evaluate the fingertip tracking performance across a variety of trajectories, including straight lines, circles, and more complex curves, and report millimeter-level accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides one of the first systematic experimental demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in a linkage-driven robotic finger, thereby establishing a benchmark for future designs aimed at dexterous in-hand manipulation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hear What Matters! Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02650v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

| **[SAM2Grasp: Resolve Multi-modal Grasping via Prompt-conditioned Temporal Action Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02609v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning for robotic grasping is often plagued by the multimodal problem: when a scene contains multiple valid targets, demonstrations of grasping different objects create conflicting training signals. Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Detection to Association: Learning Discriminative Object Embeddings for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02392v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://edit-by-track.github.io</p></details> | None |

However, existing approaches typically require a pre-defined 3D model of the target and rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limitations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single iMage), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and produce precise masks and 3D models for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Artemis: Structured Visual Reasoning for Perception Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01988v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reinforcement-learning frameworks for visual perception policy have begun to incorporate intermediate reasoning chains expressed in natural language. Empirical observations indicate that such purely linguistic intermediate reasoning often reduces performance on perception tasks. We argue that the core issue lies not in reasoning per se but in the form of reasoning: while these chains perform semantic reasoning in an unstructured linguistic space, visual perception requires reasoning in a spatial and object-centric space. In response, we introduce Artemis, a perception-policy learning framework that performs structured proposal-based reasoning, where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing a verifiable visual state. This design enables explicit tracking of intermediate states, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoids ambiguity introduced by language-based reasoning. Artemis is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, achieves strong performance on grounding and detection task and exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks. The consistent improvements across these diverse settings confirm that aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning. Owing to its strengthened visual reasoning, Artemis also achieves competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks, illustrating that spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.</p></details> |  | None |

However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) 2024</p></details> | None |

Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

| **[Benchmarking pig detection and tracking under diverse and challenging conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16639v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space (object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models. However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use and further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures and 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Evaluating SAM2 for Video Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01774v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segmentation Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has proven to be a powerful foundation model for promptable visual object segmentation in both images and videos, capable of storing object-aware memories and transferring them temporally through memory blocks. While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures and 7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[VideoScoop: A Non-Traditional Domain-Independent Framework For Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01769v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically understanding video contents is important for several applications in Civic Monitoring (CM), general Surveillance (SL), Assisted Living (AL), etc. Decades of Image and Video Analysis (IVA) research have advanced tasks such as content extraction (e.g., object recognition and tracking). Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain. This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a report submitted as part of PhD proposal defense of Hafsa Billah</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning the Boundary of Solvability: Aligning LLMs to Detect Unsolvable Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01661v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring LLM reliability requires not only solving complex problems but also recognizing when a problem is unsolvable. Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel "Reverse Construction" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/sfasfaffa/unsolvableQA.</p></details> | preprint | [Code Link](https://github.com/sfasfaffa/unsolvableQA) |

PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author-accepted version of the paper published in Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT), Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 191, 2025.

| **[Robust Phase-Shifting Profilometry for Arbitrary Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10009v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phase-shifting profilometry (PSP) enables high-accuracy 3D reconstruction but remains highly susceptible to object motion. Although numerous studies have explored compensation for motion-induced errors, residual inaccuracies still persist, particularly in complex motion scenarios. In this paper, we propose a robust phase-shifting profilometry for arbitrary motion (RPSP-AM), including six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) motion (translation and rotation in any direction), non-rigid deformations, and multi-target movements, achieving high-fidelity motion-error-free 3D reconstruction. We categorize motion errors into two components: 1) ghosting artifacts induced by image misalignment, and 2) ripple-like distortions induced by phase deviation. To eliminate the ghosting artifacts, we perform pixel-wise image alignment based on dense optical flow tracking. To correct ripple-like distortions, we propose a high-accuracy, low-complexity image-sequential binomial self-compensation (I-BSC) method, which performs a summation of the homogeneous fringe images weighted by binomial coefficients, exponentially reducing the ripple-like distortions with a competitive computational speed compared with the traditional four-step phase-shifting method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that, under challenging conditions such as 6-DoF motion, non-rigid deformations, and multi-target movements, the proposed RPSP-AM outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods in compensating for both ghosting artifacts and ripple-like distortions. Our approach extends the applicability of PSP to arbitrary motion scenarios, endowing it with potential for widespread adoption in fields such as robotics, industrial inspection, and medical reconstruction.</p></details> |  | None |

This problem becomes further complicated in the presence of sensor noise because noisy sensors provide, at best, incomplete information, which results in a distribution over target states to be intercepted. Since time is of the essence, to hit the target, the planner must begin directing the interceptor, in this case a robot arm, while still receiving information. We introduce an tree-like structure, which is grown using kinodynamic motion primitives in state-time space. This tree-like structure encodes reachability to multiple goals from a single origin, while enabling real-time value updates as the target belief evolves and seamless transitions between goals. We evaluate our framework on an interception task on a 6 DOF industrial arm (ABB IRB-1600) with an onboard stereo camera (ZED 2i). A robust Innovation-based Adaptive Estimation Adaptive Kalman Filter (RIAE-AKF) is used to track the target and perform belief updates.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent methods like DUSt3R demonstrate that regressing dense pointmaps from image pairs enables accurate and efficient pose-free reconstruction. However, existing RGB-only approaches struggle under real-world conditions involving dynamic objects and extreme illumination, due to the inherent limitations of conventional cameras. In this paper, we propose EAG3R, a novel geometry estimation framework that augments pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams. Built upon the MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces two key innovations: (1) a retinex-inspired image enhancement module and a lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion mechanism that adaptively combines RGB and event features based on local reliability; and (2) a novel event-based photometric consistency loss that reinforces spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization. Our method enables robust geometry estimation in challenging dynamic low-light scenes without requiring retraining on night-time data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAG3R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines across monocular depth estimation, camera pose tracking, and dynamic reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)</p></details> | None |

We argue that multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite extensive video training, lack this fundamental spatial reasoning capability, a critical limitation for embodied applications. To demonstrate these limitations and drive research, we introduce REM (Reasoning over Embodied Multi-Frame Trajectories), a benchmark using controllable 3D environments for long-horizon embodied spatial reasoning. REM systematically evaluates key aspects like object permanence/distinction, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking across dynamic embodied viewpoints. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing current models exhibit promising overall performance, but become increasingly unreliable at even moderate complexity levels easily handled by humans. These findings highlight challenges MLLMs face in developing robust spatial representations from sequential visual input. Consequently, REM provides targeted metrics and diagnostics to foster improved spatial understanding in future models.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior work has used generative models to replicate known category selectivity in isolated regions (e.g., faces in FFA), but these approaches offer limited insight into how regions interact during complex, naturalistic vision. We introduce NeuroVolve, a generative framework that provides brain-guided image synthesis via optimization of a neural objective function in the embedding space of a pretrained vision-language model. Images are generated under the guidance of a programmable neural objective, i.e., activating or deactivating single regions or multiple regions together. NeuroVolve is validated by recovering known selectivity for individual brain regions, while expanding to synthesize coherent scenes that satisfy complex, multi-region constraints. By tracking optimization steps, it reveals semantic trajectories through embedding space, unifying brain-guided image editing and preferred stimulus generation in a single process. We show that NeuroVolve can generate both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli for single ROIs, as well as stimuli aligned to curated neural objectives. These include co-activation and decorrelation between regions, exposing cooperative and antagonistic tuning relationships. Notably, the framework captures subject-specific preferences, supporting personalized brain-driven synthesis and offering interpretable constraints for mapping, analyzing, and probing neural representations of visual information.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios. We propose a dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations to yield features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions. We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

However, the complexity of robust visual inspection systems and their extensive data requirements hinder widespread adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings. In this context, we propose a pose-agnostic, zero-shot quality inspection framework that compares real scenes against real-time Digital Twins (DT) in the RGB-D space. Our approach enables efficient real-time DT rendering by semantically describing industrial scenes through object detection and pose estimation of known Computer-Aided Design models. We benchmark tools for real-time, multimodal RGB-D DT creation while tracking consumption of computational resources. Additionally, we provide an extensible and hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection, unifying pose labelling with logical and structural defect annotations. Based on an automotive use case featuring the quality inspection of an axial flux motor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our results demonstrate detection performace, achieving intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks, even if using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we present Multiple Fish Tracking Dataset 2025 (MFT25), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for underwater multiple fish tracking, featuring 15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments, fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar appearances, and erratic motion patterns.

Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> | None |

Robotic systems have emerged as transformative solutions to mitigate these inherent limitations. A pivotal moment has arrived, where a confluence of pressing clinical needs and breakthroughs in AI creates an opportunity for a paradigm shift toward Embodied Intelligence (EI), enabling robots to navigate complex vascular networks and adapt to dynamic physiological conditions. Data-driven approaches, leveraging advanced computer vision, medical image analysis, and machine learning, drive this evolution by enabling real-time vessel segmentation, device tracking, and anatomical landmark detection. Reinforcement learning and imitation learning further enhance navigation strategies and replicate expert techniques. This review systematically analyzes the integration of EI into endovascular robotics, identifying profound systemic challenges such as the heterogeneity in validation standards and the gap between human mimicry and machine-native capabilities. Based on this analysis, a conceptual roadmap is proposed that reframes the ultimate objective away from systems that supplant clinical decision-making. This vision of augmented intelligence, where the clinician's role evolves into that of a high-level supervisor, provides a principled foundation for the future of the field.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures | None |

In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline. We introduce a new dataset and benchmark, TAPVid360-10k comprising 10k perspective videos with ground truth directional point tracking. Our baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates, outperforming existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds.

The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios.

This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).</p></details> | 19 pages | None |

Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches mainly focus on tracking objects in each frame of a video stream, making it almost impossible to run the model under conditions of limited computing resources. To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections. We propose a novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, which allows us to effectively match objects using the Re-ID model. Furthermore, we integrate visual tracking into the Kalman Filter and the overall tracking pipeline. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers in the case of low-frequency detections, achieving $\textit{11.6%}$ HOTA improvement at $\textit{1}$ Hz on MOT17-val, while keeping up with the best approaches on the standard MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks with full-frequency detections.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent approaches aim to mitigate these issues by (i) employing advanced denoising or label assignment strategies, or (ii) incorporating detection priors from external object detectors via distillation or anchor proposal techniques. Inspired by the success of integrating detection priors and by the key insight that MOTR-like models are secretly strong detection models, we introduce SelfMOTR, a novel tracking transformer that relies on self-generated detection priors. Through extensive analysis and ablation studies, we uncover and demonstrate the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models, and present a practical set of tools for leveraging them effectively.

In this work, we investigate their self-attention maps can be reinterpreted as semantic label propagation kernels, providing robust pixel-level correspondences between relevant image regions. Extending this mechanism across frames yields a temporal propagation kernel that enables zero-shot object tracking via segmentation in videos. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time optimization strategies-DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting-in adapting diffusion features for robust and consistent label propagation. Building on these findings, we introduce DRIFT, a framework for object tracking in videos leveraging a pretrained image diffusion model with SAM-guided mask refinement, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

With the recent significant progress of one-stage methods, the two-stage Referring-by-Tracking (RBT) paradigm has gradually lost its popularity. However, its lower training cost and flexible incremental deployment remain irreplaceable. Rethinking existing two-stage RBT frameworks, we identify two fundamental limitations: the overly heuristic feature construction and fragile correspondence modeling. To address these issues, we propose FlexHook, a novel two-stage RBT framework. In FlexHook, the proposed Conditioning Hook (C-Hook) redefines the feature construction by a sampling-based strategy and language-conditioned cue injection. Then, we introduce a Pairwise Correspondence Decoder (PCD) that replaces CLIP-based similarity matching with active correspondence modeling, yielding a more flexible and robust strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (Refer-KITTI/v2, Refer-Dance, and LaMOT) demonstrate that FlexHook becomes the first two-stage RBT approach to comprehensively outperform current state-of-the-art methods.

This work presents an embedded system that integrates deep learning-based tracking with beamforming to achieve precise sound source localization and directional audio capture in dynamic environments. The approach combines single-camera depth estimation and stereo vision to enable accurate 3D localization of moving objects. A planar concentric circular microphone array constructed with MEMS microphones provides a compact, energy-efficient platform supporting 2D beam steering across azimuth and elevation. Real-time tracking outputs continuously adapt the array's focus, synchronizing the acoustic response with the target's position. By uniting learned spatial awareness with dynamic steering, the system maintains robust performance in the presence of multiple or moving sources. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant gains in signal-to-interference ratio, making the design well-suited for teleconferencing, smart home devices, and assistive technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Current video-based methods are predominantly single-view, which impedes comprehensive 3D geometry perception and often results in geometric distortions or unrealistic motion patterns. While 3D HOI approaches can generate dynamically plausible motions, their dependence on high-quality 3D data captured in controlled laboratory settings severely limits their generalization to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyncMV4D, the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view HOI videos and 4D motions by unifying visual prior, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry. Our framework features two core innovations: (1) a Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) model that co-generates HOI videos and intermediate motions, and (2) a Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) that refines the coarse intermediate motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks. To tightly couple 2D appearance with 4D dynamics, we establish a closed-loop, mutually enhancing cycle. During the diffusion denoising process, the generated video conditions the refinement of the 4D motion, while the aligned 4D point tracks are reprojected to guide next-step joint generation. Experimentally, our method demonstrates superior performance to state-of-the-art alternatives in visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://droliven.github.io/SyncMV4D</p></details> | [Code Link](https://droliven.github.io/SyncMV4D) |

However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Although recent methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, they either rely on costly human annotations for object trajectories or use time-varying representations without explicit object-level decomposition, leading to intertwined static and dynamic elements that hinder scene separation. We present IDSplat, a self-supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs dynamic scenes with explicit instance decomposition and learnable motion trajectories, without requiring human annotations. Our key insight is to model dynamic objects as coherent instances undergoing rigid transformations, rather than unstructured time-varying primitives. For instance decomposition, we employ zero-shot, language-grounded video tracking anchored to 3D using lidar, and estimate consistent poses via feature correspondences. We introduce a coordinated-turn smoothing scheme to obtain temporally and physically consistent motion trajectories, mitigating pose misalignments and tracking failures, followed by joint optimization of object poses and Gaussian parameters. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction quality while maintaining instance-level decomposition and generalizes across diverse sequences and view densities without retraining, making it practical for large-scale autonomous driving applications.

Our method discovers diverse motion patterns, ranging from trotting to galloping, robust standing policies, jumping, and handstand balancing, purely through the optimization of high-level objectives. Building on model predictive path integral (MPPI), we propose a dual-space spline parameterization that operates on position and velocity control points. Our approach enables contact-making and contact-breaking strategies that adapt automatically to task requirements, requiring only a limited number of sampled trajectories. This sample efficiency allows us to achieve real-time control on standard CPU hardware, eliminating the need for GPU acceleration typically required by other state-of-the-art MPPI methods. We validate our approach on the Go2 quadrupedal robot, demonstrating various emergent gaits and basic jumping capabilities. In simulation, we further showcase more complex behaviors, such as backflips, dynamic handstand balancing and locomotion on a Humanoid, all without requiring reference tracking or offline pre-training.</p></details> |  | None |

These systems have a limited number of receivers and can only observe a fraction of the frequencies of interest simultaneously. To improve its behavior, we propose the ResourceTune algorithm, which iteratively constructs optimized schedules to determine which frequencies each receiver should observe at a given time step. The algorithm's main component is the optimization of receiver configurations using a left-right heuristic combined with linear programming. Our approach is unique because, unlike others, we focus on optimizing available resources and observed frequencies, which was never done before. We experimentally compared the proposed algorithm with a greedy and the state-of-the-art method for construction of PSS schedules. In most of the considered scenarios, ResourceTune outperformed both algorithms, and in the most extreme case, its objective value was more than 2.7 times better than the values reached by other methods.</p></details> |  | None |

LAA3D contains 15,000 real images and 600,000 synthetic frames, captured across diverse scenarios, including urban and suburban environments. It covers multiple aerial object categories, including electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), and Helicopters. Each instance is annotated with 3D bounding box, class label, and instance identity, supporting tasks such as 3D object detection, 3D multi-object tracking (MOT), and 6-DoF pose estimation. Besides, we establish the LAA3D Benchmark, integrating multiple tasks and methods with unified evaluation protocols for comparison. Furthermore, we propose MonoLAA, a monocular 3D detection baseline, achieving robust 3D localization from zoom cameras with varying focal lengths. Models pretrained on synthetic images transfer effectively to real-world data with fine-tuning, demonstrating strong sim-to-real generalization. Our LAA3D provides a comprehensive foundation for future research in low-altitude 3D object perception.</p></details> | 25 pages | None |

Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data.

This limitation reduces their ability to interpret real or AI-generated content (AIGC) videos and to generate physically consistent content. We present an approach that addresses this gap by translating physical-world context cues into interpretable representations aligned with VLMs' perception, comprehension, and reasoning. We introduce MASS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 4,350 real-world and AIGC videos and 8,361 free-form video question-answering pairs focused on physics-related comprehension tasks, with detailed annotations including visual detections, sub-segment grounding, and full-sequence 3D motion tracking of entities. We further present MASS, a model-agnostic method that injects spatial-temporal signals into the VLM language space via depth-based 3D encoding and visual grounding, coupled with a motion tracker for object dynamics. To strengthen cross-modal alignment and reasoning, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments and ablations show that our refined VLMs outperform comparable and larger baselines, as well as prior state-of-the-art models, by 8.7% and 6.0%, achieving performance comparable to close-source SoTA VLMs such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on physics reasoning and comprehension.

However, tracking UAVs using a single visual modality often fails in challenging scenarios, such as low illumination, cluttered backgrounds, and rapid motion. Although multi-modal multi-object UAV tracking is more resilient, the development of effective solutions has been hindered by the absence of dedicated public datasets. To bridge this gap, we release MM-UAV, the first large-scale benchmark for Multi-Modal UAV Tracking, integrating three key sensing modalities, e.g. RGB, infrared (IR), and event signals. The dataset spans over 30 challenging scenarios, with 1,321 synchronised multi-modal sequences, and more than 2.8 million annotated frames. Accompanying the dataset, we provide a novel multi-modal multi-UAV tracking framework, designed specifically for UAV tracking applications and serving as a baseline for future research. Our framework incorporates two key technical innovations, e.g. an offset-guided adaptive alignment module to resolve spatio mismatches across sensors, and an adaptive dynamic fusion module to balance complementary information conveyed by different modalities. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of conventional appearance modelling in multi-object tracking, we introduce an event-enhanced association mechanism that leverages motion cues from the event modality for more reliable identity maintenance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

SatSAM2 introduces two core modules: a Kalman Filter-based Constrained Motion Module (KFCMM) to exploit temporal motion cues and suppress drift, and a Motion-Constrained State Machine (MCSM) to regulate tracking states based on motion dynamics and reliability. To support large-scale evaluation, we propose MatrixCity Video Object Tracking (MVOT), a synthetic benchmark containing 1,500+ sequences and 157K annotated frames with diverse viewpoints, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Extensive experiments on two satellite tracking benchmarks and MVOT show that SatSAM2 outperforms both traditional and foundation model-based trackers, including SAM2 and its variants.

| **[Tracking and Segmenting Anything in Any Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19475v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking and segmentation play essential roles in video understanding, providing basic positional information and temporal association of objects within video sequences. Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training. SATA demonstrates superior performance on 18 challenging tracking and segmentation benchmarks, offering a novel perspective for more generalizable video understanding.</p></details> | Accpetd by AAAI 2026 | None |

Existing benchmarks offer limited customizability over the scene complexity and are incapable of isolating and analyzing specific VLM failure modes under distinct spatial conditions. To address this gap, instead of individually presenting benchmarks for different scene complexities, in this paper we present InfiniBench, a fully automated, customizable and user-friendly benchmark generator that can synthesize a theoretically infinite variety of 3D scenes with parameterized control on scene complexity. InfiniBench uniquely translates scene descriptions in natural language into photo-realistic videos with complex and physically plausible 3D layouts. This is achieved through three key innovations: 1) a LLM-based agentic framework that iteratively refines procedural scene constraints from scene descriptions; 2) a flexible cluster-based layout optimizer that generates dense and cluttered scenes previously intractable for procedural methods; and 3) a task-aware camera trajectory optimization method that renders scenes into videos with full object coverage as VLM input. Experiments demonstrate that InfiniBench outperforms state-of-the-art procedural and LLM-based 3D generation methods in prompt fidelity and physical plausibility, especially in high-complexity scenarios. We further showcased the usefulness of InfiniBench, by generating benchmarks for representative spatial reasoning tasks including measurement, perspective-taking and spatiotemporal tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing RGBT trackers struggle to resolve modality discrepancies, which poses great challenges for robust feature representation. This limitation hinders effective cross-modal information propagation and fusion, which significantly reduces the tracking accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Contextual Aggregation with Deformable Alignment framework called CADTrack for RGBT Tracking. To be specific, we first deploy the Mamba-based Feature Interaction (MFI) that establishes efficient feature interaction via state space models. This interaction module can operate with linear complexity, reducing computational cost and improving feature discrimination. Then, we propose the Contextual Aggregation Module (CAM) that dynamically activates backbone layers through sparse gating based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). This module can encode complementary contextual information from cross-layer features. Finally, we propose the Deformable Alignment Module (DAM) to integrate deformable sampling and temporal propagation, mitigating spatial misalignment and localization drift. With the above components, our CADTrack achieves robust and accurate tracking in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on five RGBT tracking benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

RMOT benchmarks only describe the object's appearance, relative positions, and initial motion states. This so-called static regulation fails to capture dynamic changes of the object motion, including velocity changes and motion direction shifts. This limitation not only causes a temporal discrepancy between static references and dynamic vision modality but also constrains multi-modal tracking performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Vision-Motion-Reference aligned RMOT framework, named VMRMOT. It integrates a motion modality extracted from object dynamics to enhance the alignment between vision modality and language references through multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we introduce motion-aware descriptions derived from object dynamic behaviors and, leveraging the powerful temporal-reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, extract motion features as the motion modality. We further design a Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment (VMRA) module to hierarchically align visual queries with motion and reference cues, enhancing their cross-modal consistency. In addition, a Motion-Guided Prediction Head (MGPH) is developed to explore motion modality to enhance the performance of the prediction head. To the best of our knowledge, VMRMOT is the first approach to employ MLLMs in the RMOT task for vision-reference alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple RMOT benchmarks demonstrate that VMRMOT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it remains underdiagnosed because current diagnostic methods depend heavily on subjective clinical assessments. To enable objective detection, we introduce a gold standard dataset of 103 clinically assessed participants collected through a tripartite data approach which uniquely integrated eye tracking data with audio and video to give a comprehensive representation of depressive symptoms. Eye tracking data quantifies the attentional bias towards negative stimuli that is frequently observed in depressed groups. Audio and video data capture the affective flattening and psychomotor retardation characteristic of depression. Statistical validation confirmed their significant discriminative power in distinguishing depressed from non depressed groups. We address a critical limitation of existing graph-based models that focus on low-frequency information and propose a Multi-Frequency Graph Convolutional Network (MF-GCN). This framework consists of a novel Multi-Frequency Filter Bank Module (MFFBM), which can leverage both low and high frequency signals. Extensive evaluation against traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks demonstrates that MF-GCN consistently outperforms baselines. In binary classification, the model achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 and F2 score of 0.94. For the 3 class classification task, the proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.87 and siginificantly suprassed other models. To validate generalizability, the model was also evaluated on the Chinese Multimodal Depression Corpus (CMDC) dataset and achieved a sensitivity of 0.95 and F2 score of 0.96. These results confirm that our trimodal, multi frequency framework effectively captures cross modal interaction for accurate depression detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in locomotion and whole-body tracking have enabled impressive progress in either agile dynamic skills or stability-critical behaviors, but existing methods remain specialized, focusing on one capability while compromising the other. In this work, we introduce AMS (Agility Meets Stability), the first framework that unifies both dynamic motion tracking and extreme balance maintenance in a single policy. Our key insight is to leverage heterogeneous data sources: human motion capture datasets that provide rich, agile behaviors, and physically constrained synthetic balance motions that capture stability configurations. To reconcile the divergent optimization goals of agility and stability, we design a hybrid reward scheme that applies general tracking objectives across all data while injecting balance-specific priors only into synthetic motions. Further, an adaptive learning strategy with performance-driven sampling and motion-specific reward shaping enables efficient training across diverse motion distributions. We validate AMS extensively in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Experiments demonstrate that a single policy can execute agile skills such as dancing and running, while also performing zero-shot extreme balance motions like Ip Man's Squat, highlighting AMS as a versatile control paradigm for future humanoid applications.</p></details> |  | None |

PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |

The goal of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$ compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm knowing all functions of the sequence in advance. In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences, we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the $K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its $\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$ regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times. We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known $\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log K})$.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SAM 3: Segment Anything with Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16719v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SAM2S: Segment Anything in Surgical Videos via Semantic Long-term Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16618v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field. With the deployment-friendly sensing simulation and dynamics model-free acceleration control, the proposed system shows a superior success rate and adaptability to alternatives, and the policy derived from the simulator can drive a real-world quadrotor with safe maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), November, 2025</p></details> | None |

The proposed pipeline is designed to enable efficient, close to real-time performance, supporting applications including assistive navigation. To achieve continuous updates of the 3D scene representation, we process the image flow with a sliding window, aligning submaps, thereby overcoming VGGT's high memory demands. We exploit the VGGT tracking head to aggregate 2D semantic instance masks into 3D objects. To allow for temporal consistency and richer contextual reasoning the system stores timestamps and instance-level identities, thereby enabling the detection of changes in the environment. We evaluate the approach on well-known benchmarks and custom datasets specifically designed for assistive navigation scenarios. The results demonstrate the applicability of the framework to real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SwiTrack: Tri-State Switch for Cross-Modal Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16227v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts  triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that CompTrack achieves top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at a real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> | None |

We propose a robust estimation method, ROAMS, that mitigates the influence of additive outliers by introducing shift parameters at each timepoint in the observation equation of the SSM. These parameters allow the model to attribute non-zero shifts to outliers while leaving clean observations unaffected. ROAMS then enables automatic outlier detection, through the addition of a penalty term on the number of flagged outlying timepoints in the objective function, and simultaneous estimation of model parameters. We apply the method to robustly estimate SSMs on both simulated data and real-world animal location-tracking data, demonstrating its ability to produce more reliable parameter estimates than classical methods and other benchmark methods. In addition to improved robustness, ROAMS offers practical diagnostic tools, including BIC curves for selecting tuning parameters and visualising outlier structure. These features make our approach broadly useful for researchers and practitioners working with contaminated time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing memory-based trackers often suffer from quadratic computational complexity, temporal redundancy, and insufficient exploitation of geometric priors. To address these issues, we propose MambaTrack3D, a novel HTV-oriented tracking framework built upon the state space model Mamba. Specifically, we design a Mamba-based Inter-frame Propagation (MIP) module that replaces conventional single-frame feature extraction with efficient inter-frame propagation, achieving near-linear complexity while explicitly modeling spatial relations across historical frames. Furthermore, a Grouped Feature Enhancement Module (GFEM) is introduced to separate foreground and background semantics at the channel level, thereby mitigating temporal redundancy in the memory bank. Extensive experiments on KITTI-HTV and nuScenes-HTV benchmarks demonstrate that MambaTrack3D consistently outperforms both HTV-oriented and normal-scenario trackers, achieving improvements of up to 6.5 success and 9.5 precision over HVTrack under moderate temporal gaps. On the standard KITTI dataset, MambaTrack3D remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art normal-scenario trackers, confirming its strong generalization ability. Overall, MambaTrack3D achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, delivering robust performance across both specialized HTV and conventional tracking scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a journal for possible publication</p></details> | None |

However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only 35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCVW2025</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces a novel method that uses an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to fuse 2D bounding box or pose keypoint ground truth annotations from multiple calibrated cameras into accurate 3D ground truth. By leveraging human-annotated ground-truth 2D, our proposed method, a multi-camera single-object tracking algorithm, transforms 2D image coordinates into robust 3D world coordinates through homography-based projection and UKF-based fusion. Our proposed algorithm processes multi-view data to estimate object positions and shapes while effectively handling challenges such as occlusion. We evaluate our method on the CMC, Wildtrack, and Panoptic datasets, demonstrating high accuracy in 3D localization compared to the available 3D ground truth. Unlike existing approaches that provide only ground-plane information, our method also outputs the full 3D shape of each object. Additionally, the algorithm offers a scalable and fully automatic solution for multi-camera systems using only 2D image annotations.</p></details> |  | None |

Bimanual psychomotor proficiency is fundamental to neurosurgical procedures, yet it remains difficult for trainees to acquire and for educators to objectively evaluate performance. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of a neurosurgical simulation platform that integrates an anatomically realistic brain model with surgical instrument tracking to support training and objective assessment of bimanual tasks in the context of subpial corticectomy. Methods. We developed and evaluated a neurosurgical simulation platform based on an ex-vivo calf brain model and a multi-camera tracking system capable of simultaneously capturing the motion of surgical instruments in both hands, including collection of real-time instrument trajectories and synchronized video recordings. These enabled extraction of motion-based, time-based, and bimanual coordination metrics. We conducted a case series involving 47 participants across four training levels: medical students, junior residents, senior residents, and neurosurgeons. Results. The tracking system successfully captured instrument motion during 81% of the periods when instruments were actively used throughout the simulation procedure. Several extracted metrics were able to significantly differentiate between levels of surgical expertise. In particular, instrument usage duration and custom-defined bimanual coordination metrics such as instrument tip separation distance and simultaneous usage time, show potential as features to identify participant expertise levels with different instruments. Conclusions. We demonstrated the feasibility of tracking surgical instruments during complex bimanual tasks in an ex-vivo brain simulation platform. The metrics developed provide a foundation for objective performance assessment and highlight the potential of motion analysis to improve neurosurgical training and evaluation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures | None |

Persisting these objects is critical, not only to enhance system robustness against unexpected failures but also to support continuous, non-linear data exploration via versioning. Existing object persistence mechanisms (e.g., Pickle, Dill) rely on complete snapshotting, often redundantly storing unchanged objects during execution and exploration, resulting in significant inefficiency in both time and storage. Unlike DBMSs, data science systems lack centralized buffer managers that track dirty objects. Worse, object states span various locations such as memory heaps, shared memory, GPUs, and remote machines, making dirty object identification fundamentally more challenging. In this work, we propose a graph-based object store, named Chipmink, that acts like the centralized buffer manager. Unlike static pages in DBMSs, persistence units in Chipmink are dynamically induced by partitioning objects into appropriate subgroups (called pods), minimizing expected persistence costs based on object sizes and reference structure. These pods effectively isolate dirty objects, enabling efficient partial persistence. Our experiments show that Chipmink is general, supporting libraries that rely on shared memory, GPUs, and remote objects. Moreover, Chipmink achieves up to 36.5x smaller storage sizes and 12.4x faster persistence than the best baselines in real-world notebooks and scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 21 figures, to appear at VLDB 2026</p></details> | None |

It operates without the need for training, offering a distinct advantage over existing diffusion methods that transfer style across entire videos. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (1) A point-matching mask propagation strategy that leverages the feature maps from the DDIM inversion. This streamlines the model's architecture by obviating the need for tracking models. (2) A training-free AdaIN-guided localized video stylization mechanism that operates at both the latent and attention levels. This balances content fidelity and style richness, mitigating the loss of localized details commonly associated with direct video stylization. (3) A sliding-window consistent smoothing scheme that harnesses optical flow within the pixel representation and refines predicted noise to update the latent space. This significantly enhances temporal consistency and diminishes artifacts in stylized video. Our proposed UniVST has been validated to be superior to existing methods in quantitative and qualitative metrics. It adeptly addresses the challenges of preserving the primary object's style while ensuring temporal consistency and detail preservation.

A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Conversely, recent data-driven motion predictors capture complex non-linear dynamics but suffer from limited domain generalization and computational overhead. Through extensive analysis, we reveal that even in datasets dominated by non-linear motion, Kalman filter outperforms data-driven predictors in up to 34\% of cases, demonstrating that real-world tracking scenarios inherently involve both linear and non-linear patterns. To leverage this complementarity, we propose PlugTrack, a novel framework that adaptively fuses Kalman filter and data-driven motion predictors through multi-perceptive motion understanding. Our approach employs multi-perceptive motion analysis to generate adaptive blending factors. PlugTrack achieves significant performance gains on MOT17/MOT20 and state-of-the-art on DanceTrack without modifying existing motion predictors. To the best of our knowledge, PlugTrack is the first framework to bridge classical and modern motion prediction paradigms through adaptive fusion in MOT.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026.

Traditional methods primarily rely on 3D bounding boxes to represent these obstacles, which often fail to capture the complexity of irregularly shaped, real-world objects. To overcome these limitations, we present GUIDE, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussians for instance detection and occupancy prediction. Unlike conventional occupancy prediction methods, GUIDE also offers robust tracking capabilities. Our framework employs a sparse representation strategy, using Gaussian-to-Voxel Splatting to provide fine-grained, instance-level occupancy data without the computational demands associated with dense voxel grids. Experimental validation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates GUIDE's performance, with an instance occupancy mAP of 21.61, marking a 50\% improvement over existing methods, alongside competitive tracking capabilities. GUIDE establishes a new benchmark in autonomous perception systems, effectively combining precision with computational efficiency to better address the complexities of real-world driving environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contrastive Entropy Bounds for Density and Conditional Density Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12903v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the interpretability of neural network features from a Bayesian Gaussian view, where optimizing a cost is reaching a probabilistic bound; learning a model approximates a density that makes the bound tight and the cost optimal, often with a Gaussian mixture density. The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle. We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs. Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a framework for automated, task-driven LiDAR system design under arbitrary constraints. To achieve this, we represent LiDAR configurations in a continuous six-dimensional design space and learn task-specific implicit densities in this space via flow-based generative modeling. We then synthesize new LiDAR systems by modeling sensors as parametric distributions in 6D space and fitting these distributions to our learned implicit density using expectation-maximization, enabling efficient, constraint-aware LiDAR system design. We validate our method on diverse tasks in 3D vision, enabling automated LiDAR system design across real-world-inspired applications in face scanning, robotic tracking, and object detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DMSORT: An efficient parallel maritime multi-object tracking architecture for unmanned vessel platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04128v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore, a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features. Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories. Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise, occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

| **[Motion-Aware Transformer for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21715v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6 mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Ontology-Based Approach to Optimizing Geometry Problem Sets for Skill Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02758v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Euclidean geometry has historically played a central role in cultivating logical reasoning and abstract thinking within mathematics education, but has experienced waning emphasis in recent curricula. The resurgence of interest, driven by advances in artificial intelligence and educational technology, has highlighted geometry's potential to develop essential cognitive skills and inspired new approaches to automated problem solving and proof verification. This article presents an ontology-based framework for annotating and optimizing geometry problem sets, originally developed in the 1990s. The ontology systematically classifies geometric problems, solutions, and associated skills into interlinked facts, objects, and methods, supporting granular tracking of student abilities and facilitating curriculum design. The core concept of 'solution graphs'--directed acyclic graphs encoding multiple solution pathways and skill dependencies--enables alignment of problem selection with instructional objectives. We hypothesize that this framework also points toward automated solution validation via semantic parsing. We contend that our approach addresses longstanding challenges in representing dynamic, procedurally complex mathematical knowledge, paving the way for adaptive, feedback-rich educational tools. Our methodology offers a scalable, adaptable foundation for future advances in intelligent geometry education and automated reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaffolding Dexterous Manipulation with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19212v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous robotic hands are essential for performing complex manipulation tasks, yet remain difficult to train due to the challenges of demonstration collection and high-dimensional control. While reinforcement learning (RL) can alleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it typically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which hinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous manipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories. These trajectories specify target hand poses that guide the exploration of RL policies and object poses that enable dense, task-agnostic rewards. However, sourcing suitable trajectories - particularly for dexterous hands - remains a significant challenge. Yet, the precise details in explicit reference trajectories are often unnecessary, as RL ultimately refines the motion. Our key insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the commonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide exploration effectively. Given a task description (e.g., "open the cabinet") and a visual scene, our method uses an off-the-shelf VLM to first identify task-relevant keypoints (e.g., handles, buttons) and then synthesize 3D trajectories for hand motion and object motion. Subsequently, we train a low-level residual RL policy in simulation to track these coarse trajectories or "scaffolds" with high fidelity. Across a number of simulated tasks involving articulated objects and semantic understanding, we demonstrate that our method is able to learn robust dexterous manipulation policies. Moreover, we showcase that our method transfers to real-world robotic hands without any human demonstrations or handcrafted rewards.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast to previous approaches that treat segmentation as auxiliary information, SAM2MOT places it at the heart of the tracking process, systematically tackling challenges like false positives and occlusions. Its effectiveness has been thoroughly validated on major MOT benchmarks. Furthermore, SAM2MOT integrates pre-trained detector, pre-trained segmentor with tracking logic into a zero-shot MOT system that requires no fine-tuning. This significantly reduces dependence on labeled data and paves the way for transitioning MOT research from task-specific solutions to general-purpose systems. Experiments on DanceTrack, UAVDT, and BDD100K show state-of-the-art results. Notably, SAM2MOT outperforms existing methods on DanceTrack by +2.1 HOTA and +4.5 IDF1, highlighting its effectiveness in MOT.

| **[Learning Adaptive Neural Teleoperation for Humanoid Robots: From Inverse Kinematics to End-to-End Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12390v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual reality (VR) teleoperation has emerged as a promising approach for controlling humanoid robots in complex manipulation tasks. However, traditional teleoperation systems rely on inverse kinematics (IK) solvers and hand-tuned PD controllers, which struggle to handle external forces, adapt to different users, and produce natural motions under dynamic conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based neural teleoperation framework that replaces the conventional IK+PD pipeline with learned policies trained via reinforcement learning. Our approach learns to directly map VR controller inputs to robot joint commands while implicitly handling force disturbances, producing smooth trajectories, and adapting to user preferences. We train our policies in simulation using demonstrations collected from IK-based teleoperation as initialization, then fine-tune them with force randomization and trajectory smoothness rewards. Experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that our learned policies achieve 34% lower tracking error, 45% smoother motions, and superior force adaptation compared to the IK baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (50Hz control frequency). We validate our approach on manipulation tasks including object pick-and-place, door opening, and bimanual coordination. These results suggest that learning-based approaches can significantly improve the naturalness and robustness of humanoid teleoperation systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

This requires mechanisms that can both identify semantically related objects across images and accurately produce segmentation masks. We note that Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), with its prompt-and-propagate mechanism, offers both strong segmentation capabilities and a built-in feature matching process. However, we show that its representations are entangled with task-specific cues optimized for object tracking, which impairs its use for tasks requiring higher level semantic understanding. Our key insight is that, despite its class-agnostic pretraining, SAM2 already encodes rich semantic structure in its features. We propose SANSA (Semantically AligNed Segment Anything 2), a framework that makes this latent structure explicit, and repurposes SAM2 for few-shot segmentation through minimal task-specific modifications. SANSA achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot segmentation benchmarks specifically designed to assess generalization, outperforms generalist methods in the popular in-context setting, supports various prompts flexible interaction via points, boxes, or scribbles, and remains significantly faster and more compact than prior approaches.

How synthetic images can alleviate image scarcity in wildlife surveys: a case study with muskox (Ovibos moschatus)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11882v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate population estimates are essential for wildlife management, providing critical insights into species abundance and distribution. Traditional survey methods, including visual aerial counts and GNSS telemetry tracking, are widely used to monitor muskox populations in Arctic regions. These approaches are resource intensive and constrained by logistical challenges. Advances in remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and high resolution aerial imagery offer promising alternatives for wildlife detection. Yet, the effectiveness of deep learning object detection models (ODMs) is often limited by small datasets, making it challenging to train robust ODMs for sparsely distributed species like muskoxen. This study investigates the integration of synthetic imagery (SI) to supplement limited training data and improve muskox detection in zero shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) settings. We compared a baseline model trained on real imagery with 5 ZS and 5 FS models that incorporated progressively more SI in the training set. For the ZS models, where no real images were included in the training set, adding SI improved detection performance. As more SI were added, performance in precision, recall and F1 score increased, but eventually plateaued, suggesting diminishing returns when SI exceeded 100% of the baseline model training dataset. For FS models, combining real and SI led to better recall and slightly higher overall accuracy compared to using real images alone, though these improvements were not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SI to train accurate ODMs when data is scarce, offering important perspectives for wildlife monitoring by enabling rare or inaccessible species to be monitored and to increase monitoring frequency. This approach could be used to initiate ODMs without real data and refine it as real images are acquired over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation</p></details> | None |

We propose a new method to achieve environment-aware safe tracking (EAST) of robot motion plans that integrates an obstacle clearance cost for path planning, a convex reachable set for robot motion prediction, and safety constraints for dynamic obstacle avoidance. EAST adapts the motion of the robot according to the locally sensed environment geometry and dynamics, leading to fast motion in wide open areas and cautious behavior in narrow passages or near moving obstacles. Our control design uses a reference governor, a virtual dynamical system that guides the robot's motion and decouples the path tracking and safety objectives. While reference governor methods have been used for safe tracking control in static environments, our key contribution is an extension to dynamic environments using convex optimization with control barrier function (CBF) constraints. Thus, our work establishes a connection between reference governor techniques and CBF techniques for safe control in dynamic environments. We validate our approach in simulated and real-world environments, featuring complex obstacle configurations and natural dynamic obstacle motion.</p></details> |  | None |

In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Our method builds on the concept of forgetting factors, allowing the estimator to adapt to gradual or abrupt changes in the data-generating process without prior knowledge of its dynamics. We introduce a novel online forgetting-factor periodogram and show that, under stationarity, it asymptotically recovers the properties of its offline counterpart. Leveraging this, we construct an online Whittle estimator, and further develop an adaptive online spectral estimator that dynamically tunes its forgetting factor using the Whittle likelihood as a loss. Through extensive simulation studies and an application to ocean drifter velocity data, we demonstrate the method's ability to track time-varying spectral properties in real-time with strong empirical performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Learning from human demonstrations offers a scalable approach to acquiring these capabilities. However, prior works either produce unnatural motions or rely on motion-specific tuning to achieve satisfactory naturalness. Furthermore, these methods are often motion- or goal-specific, lacking the versatility to compose diverse skills, especially when solving unseen tasks. We present BeyondMimic, a framework that scales to diverse motions and carries the versatility to compose them seamlessly in tackling unseen downstream tasks. At heart, a compact motion-tracking formulation enables mastering a wide range of radically agile behaviors, including aerial cartwheels, spin-kicks, flip-kicks, and sprinting, with a single setup and shared hyperparameters, all while achieving state-of-the-art human-like performance. Moving beyond the mere imitation of existing motions, we propose a unified latent diffusion model that empowers versatile goal specification, seamless task switching, and dynamic composition of these agile behaviors. Leveraging classifier guidance, a diffusion-specific technique for test-time optimization toward novel objectives, our model extends its capability to solve downstream tasks never encountered during training, including motion inpainting, joystick teleoperation, and obstacle avoidance, and transfers these skills zero-shot to real hardware. This work opens new frontiers for humanoid robots by pushing the limits of scalable human-like motor skill acquisition from human motion and advancing seamless motion synthesis that achieves generalization and versatility beyond training setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://beyondmimic.github.io/</p></details> | None |

We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[STORM: Segment, Track, and Object Re-Localization from a Single 3D Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09771v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D pose estimation and tracking are fundamental capabilities for physical AI systems such as robots. However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hand Held Multi-Object Tracking Dataset in American Football](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09455v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Learning Dynamics of Subword Segmentation for Morphologically Diverse Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09197v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.</p></details> |  | None |

The study is motivated by a moving object tracking problem in a sensor network and can find applications in settings where the order of the symbols in a codeword cannot be maintained or observed. In this paper a multiset coding scheme is proposed on source data that can be organized as a flat or cyclic multi-dimensional integer lattice (grid). A fundamental idea in the solution approach is to decompose the original source data grid into sub-grids. The original multiset coding problem can then be restricted to each of the sub-grid. Solutions for the sub-grids are subsequently piece together to form the desired solution. We name this circle of idea as sunmao construction in reference to woodwork construction method with ancient origin. Braid codes are specific solutions defined using the sunmao construction. They are easy to define for multi-dimensional grids. Moreover for a code of a given code set size and multiset cardinality, if we measure coding efficiency by the number of distinct symbols required, then braid codes have asymptotic order equal to those that are optimal. We also show that braid codes have interesting inherent error correction properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Existing software is developed based on models or motion-captured data, resulting in limited flexibility. To address this issue, a simulator that directly generates Doppler spectra from recorded video footage (RadHARSimulator V2) is presented in this paper. Both computer vision and radar modules are included in the simulator. In computer vision module, the real-time model for object detection with global nearest neighbor is first used to detect and track human targets in the video. Then, the high-resolution network is used to estimate two-dimensional poses of the detected human targets. Next, the three-dimensional poses of the detected human targets are obtained by nearest matching method. Finally, smooth temporal three-dimensional pose estimation is achieved through Kalman filtering. In radar module, pose interpolation and smoothing are first achieved through the Savitzky-Golay method. Second, the delay model and the mirror method are used to simulate echoes in both free-space and through-the-wall scenarios. Then, range-time map is generated using pulse compression, moving target indication, and DnCNN. Next, Doppler-time map (DTM) is generated using short-time Fourier transform and DnCNN again. Finally, the ridge features on the DTM are extracted using the maximum local energy method. In addition, a hybrid parallel-serial neural network architecture is proposed for radar-based HAR. Numerical experiments are conducted and analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed simulator and the proposed network model.

Our approach integrates Time-Integrated Deep Operator Networks (TI-DeepONets) as differentiable PDE surrogate models within the Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC)-a self-supervised learning framework for constrained neural control policies. The TI-DeepONet architecture learns temporal derivatives and couples them with numerical integrators, thus preserving the temporal causality of infinite-dimensional PDEs while reducing error accumulation in long-horizon predictions. Within DPC, we leverage automatic differentiation to compute policy gradients by backpropagating the expectations of optimal control loss through the learned TI-DeepONet, enabling efficient offline optimization of neural policies without the need for online optimization or supervisory controllers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method learns feasible parametric policies across diverse PDE systems, including the heat, the nonlinear Burgers', and the reaction-diffusion equations. The learned policies achieve target tracking, constraint satisfaction, and curvature minimization objectives, while generalizing across distributions of initial conditions and problem parameters. These results highlight the promise of combining operator learning with DPC for scalable, model-based self-supervised learning in PDE-constrained optimal control.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by this, we explore integrating spatio-temporal specific rewards into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to address the unique challenges of video understanding, such as long-range temporal associations. This paper investigates how rule-based rewards, particularly temporal ones, can improve video reasoning and their generalizability. Our study proposes Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) as a data-efficient method to enhance video reasoning on specific tasks without sacrificing original capabilities. Through joint RFT on multiple spatio-temporal perception tasks, we developed VideoChat-R1, a powerful Video MLLM. VideoChat-R1 achieves state-of-the-art spatio-temporal perception, demonstrating significant improvements in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2), while also improving general QA benchmarks. The enhanced perception and preserved chat abilities contribute to a more reliable video dialogue system, leading to our ``Temporal Clue-driven Reasoning" inference schema. This work provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world video comprehension agents.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DMAT: An End-to-End Framework for Joint Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation and Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04323v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end training strategy leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector. Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets corrupted by generated turbulence.</p></details> | Accepted to WACV2026 | None |

The goal in EgoTV is to verify the execution of tasks from egocentric videos based on the natural language description of these tasks. EgoTV contains pairs of videos and their task descriptions for multi-step tasks -- these tasks contain multiple sub-task decompositions, state changes, object interactions, and sub-task ordering constraints. In addition, EgoTV also provides abstracted task descriptions that contain only partial details about ways to accomplish a task. Consequently, EgoTV requires causal, temporal, and compositional reasoning of video and language modalities, which is missing in existing datasets. We also find that existing vision-language models struggle at such all round reasoning needed for task verification in EgoTV. Inspired by the needs of EgoTV, we propose a novel Neuro-Symbolic Grounding (NSG) approach that leverages symbolic representations to capture the compositional and temporal structure of tasks. We demonstrate NSG's capability towards task tracking and verification on our EgoTV dataset and a real-world dataset derived from CrossTask (CTV). We open-source the EgoTV and CTV datasets and the NSG model for future research on egocentric assistive agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2023</p></details> | None |

To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

Existing automatic mixing systems treat this task as a deterministic regression problem, thus ignoring this multiplicity of solutions. Here we introduce MEGAMI (Multitrack Embedding Generative Auto MIxing), a generative framework that models the conditional distribution of professional mixes given unprocessed tracks. MEGAMI uses a track-agnostic effects processor conditioned on per-track generated embeddings, handles arbitrary unlabeled tracks through a permutation-equivariant architecture, and enables training on both dry and wet recordings via domain adaptation. Our objective evaluation using distributional metrics shows consistent improvements over existing methods, while listening tests indicate performances approaching human-level quality across diverse musical genres.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> | None |

Research has shown that code written in some paradigms can be harder to comprehend, but to date, no research has looked at which paradigm-specific language features impact comprehension. To this end, this study seeks to uncover which paradigm-specific features impactcomprehension and debugging of code or how multi-paradigm code might affect a developer's ability to do so. We present an exploratory empirical eye-tracking study to investigate 1) how developers classify the predominant paradigm in Python code and 2) how the paradigm affects their ability to debug Python code. The goal is to uncover if specific language features are looked at more often while classifying and debugging code with a predominant paradigm. Twenty-nine developers (primarily students) were recruited for the study and were each given four classification and four debugging tasks in Python. Eye movements were recorded during all the tasks. The results indicate confusion in labeling Functional and Procedural paradigms, but not Object-Oriented. The code with predominantly functional paradigms also took the longest to complete. Changing the predominant paradigm did not affect the ability to debug the code, though developers did rate themselves with lower confidence for Functional code. We report significant differences in reading patterns during debugging, especially in the Functional code. During classification, results show that developers do not necessarily read paradigm-relevant token types.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a target-visible trajectory planning pipeline using quadratic programming. Our approach can handle various tracking settings, including single and dual target following and both static and dynamic environments, unlike other works that focus on a single specific setup. In contrast to other studies that fully trust the predicted trajectory of the target and consider only the visibility of the center of the target, our pipeline considers error in target path prediction and the entire body of the target to maintain the target visibility robustly. First, a prediction module uses a sample-check strategy to quickly calculate the reachable areas of moving objects, which represent the areas their bodies can reach, considering obstacles. Subsequently, the planning module formulates a single QP problem, considering path homotopy, to generate a tracking trajectory that maximizes the visibility of the target's reachable area among obstacles. The performance of the planner is validated in multiple scenarios, through high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures | None |

The system can quickly detect and monitor dumped waste using a street-level camera and object detection algorithm. Data was collected from the Sangareddy district in Telangana, India. A series of comprehensive experiments was carried out using the proposed dataset to assess the accuracy and overall performance of various object detection models. Specifically, we performed an in-depth evaluation of YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11m, and RT-DETR on our dataset. Among these models, YOLO11m achieved the highest accuracy of 92.39\% in waste detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting waste. Additionally, it attains an mAP@50 of 0.91, highlighting its high precision. These findings confirm that the object detection model is well-suited for monitoring and tracking waste dumping events at GVP locations. Furthermore, the system effectively captures waste disposal patterns, including hourly, daily, and weekly dumping trends, ensuring comprehensive daily and nightly monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together, LIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.</p></details> | under review | None |

To address this gap, this work introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR), aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model, effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures.

Such a formulation of source coding is an alternative approach to the traditional framework and is inspired by an object tracking problem over proximity sensor networks. We define a \textit{multiset combinatorial Gray code} as a mulitset code with fixed multiset cardinality that possesses combinatorial Gray code characteristic. For source codes that are organized as a grid, namely an integer lattice, we propose a solution by first constructing a mapping from the grid to the alphabet set, the codes are then defined as the images of rectangular blocks in the grid of fixed dimensions. We refer to the mapping as a \textit{color mapping} and the code as a \textit{color multiset code}. We propose the idea of product multiset code that enables us to construct codes for high dimensional grids based on 1-dimensional (1D) grids. We provide a detailed analysis of color multiset codes on 1D grids, focusing on codes that require the minimal number of colors. To illustrate the application of such a coding scheme, we consider an object tracking problem on 2D grids and show its efficiency, which comes from exploiting transmission parallelism. Some numerical results are presented to conclude the paper.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures | None |

The ability to perceive, track, and manipulate these objects without prior knowledge of their geometry or kinematic properties remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a novel method for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or articulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge regarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed ArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point clouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for point cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints in objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or hold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to move the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively evaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating objects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging visual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard dataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms of pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments indicate that robust and accurate pose tracking leveraging visuo-tactile information enables robots to perceive and interact with unseen complex articulated objects (with revolute or prismatic joints).</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[Physics-Informed Image Restoration via Progressive PDE Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06244v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion blur, caused by relative movement between camera and scene during exposure, significantly degrades image quality and impairs downstream computer vision tasks such as object detection, tracking, and recognition in dynamic environments. While deep learning-based motion deblurring methods have achieved remarkable progress, existing approaches face fundamental challenges in capturing the long-range spatial dependencies inherent in motion blur patterns. Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer. These results validate that incorporating mathematical physics principles through PDE-based global layers can enhance deep learning-based image restoration, establishing a promising direction for physics-informed neural network design in computer vision applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

Perhaps due to its complexity and low adoption in industry, it became a natural candidate for studies aiming at improving its concrete syntax and the stakeholders' ability to correctly interpret i* models. Objectives: We evaluate the impact of semantic transparency on understanding and reviewing i* models, in the presence of a language key. Methods: We performed a quasi-experiment comparing the standard i* concrete syntax with an alternative that has an increased semantic transparency. We asked 57 novice participants to perform understanding and reviewing tasks on i* models, and measured their accuracy, speed and ease, using metrics of task success, time and effort, collected with eye-tracking and participants' feedback. Results: We found no evidence of improved accuracy or speed attributable to the alternative concrete syntax. Although participants' perceived ease was similar, they devoted significantly less visual effort to the model and the provided language key, when using the alternative concrete syntax. Conclusions: The context provided by the model and language key may mitigate the i* symbol recognition deficit reported in previous works. However, the alternative concrete syntax required a significantly lower visual effort.</p></details> | preprint | None |
