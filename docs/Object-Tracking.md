| **[MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability. Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii) Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and (iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at https://github.com/Annzstbl/MMOT.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Annzstbl/MMOT) |
| **[LTGS: Long-Term Gaussian Scene Chronology From Sparse View Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09881v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures. However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations, significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines while enabling fast and light-weight updates.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fast Self-Supervised depth and mask aware Association for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09878v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with linear motion, such as MOT17.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GL-DT: Multi-UAV Detection and Tracking with Global-Local Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09092v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT) technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However, complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MSITrack: A Challenging Benchmark for Multispectral Single Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06619v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers. Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance, enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack, the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines, highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field. The MSITrack dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/Fengtao191/MSITrack.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Fengtao191/MSITrack) |
| **[ResMimic: From General Motion Tracking to Humanoid Whole-body Loco-Manipulation via Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05070v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid whole-body loco-manipulation promises transformative capabilities for daily service and warehouse tasks. While recent advances in general motion tracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these policies lack the precision and object awareness required for loco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual learning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human motion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion, serves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements. An efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT outputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further facilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object tracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that encourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a curriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We evaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results show substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness over strong baselines.

| **[Learning Frequency and Memory-Aware Prompts for Multi-Modal Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23972v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have made strong progress by using lightweight visual adapters to inject auxiliary-modality cues into frozen foundation models. However, they still underutilize two essentials: modality-specific frequency structure and long-range temporal dependencies. We present Learning Frequency and Memory-Aware Prompts, a dual-adapter framework that injects lightweight prompts into a frozen RGB tracker. A frequency-guided visual adapter adaptively transfers complementary cues across modalities by jointly calibrating spatial, channel, and frequency components, narrowing the modality gap without full fine-tuning. A multilevel memory adapter with short, long, and permanent memory stores, updates, and retrieves reliable temporal context, enabling consistent propagation across frames and robust recovery from occlusion, motion blur, and illumination changes. This unified design preserves the efficiency of prompt learning while strengthening cross-modal interaction and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event benchmarks show consistent state-of-the-art results over fully fine-tuned and adapter-based baselines, together with favorable parameter efficiency and runtime.

| **[Temporal Misalignment Attacks against Multimodal Perception in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09095v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |
| **[CHAI: Command Hijacking against embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00181v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to handle edge cases in robotic vehicle systems where data is scarce by using common-sense reasoning grounded in perception and action to generalize beyond training distributions and adapt to novel real-world situations. These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VideoChat-R1: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Perception via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06958v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Collaborating Vision, Depth, and Thermal Signals for Multi-Modal Tracking: Dataset and Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24741v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR), aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model, effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BEVTrack: A Simple and Strong Baseline for 3D Single Object Tracking in Bird's-Eye View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02185v7)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Single Object Tracking (SOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision and plays a critical role in applications like autonomous driving. However, existing algorithms often involve complex designs and multiple loss functions, making model training and deployment challenging. Furthermore, their reliance on fixed probability distribution assumptions (e.g., Laplacian or Gaussian) hinders their ability to adapt to diverse target characteristics such as varying sizes and motion patterns, ultimately affecting tracking precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective motion-based tracking method. BEVTrack directly estimates object motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) using a single regression loss. To enhance accuracy for targets with diverse attributes, it learns adaptive likelihood functions tailored to individual targets, avoiding the limitations of fixed distribution assumptions in previous methods. This approach provides valuable priors for tracking and significantly boosts performance. Comprehensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art results while operating at 200 FPS, enabling real-time applicability. The code will be released at https://github.com/xmm-prio/BEVTrack.</p></details> | IJCAI version | [Code Link](https://github.com/xmm-prio/BEVTrack) |
| **[Motion-Aware Transformer for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21715v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6 mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Investigating Traffic Accident Detection Using Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19096v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response. Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci- dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025).

| **[An Analysis of Kalman Filter based Object Tracking Methods for Fast-Moving Tiny Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18451v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[StereoFoley: Object-Aware Stereo Audio Generation from Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18272v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present StereoFoley, a video-to-audio generation framework that produces semantically aligned, temporally synchronized, and spatially accurate stereo sound at 48 kHz. While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DepTR-MOT: Unveiling the Potential of Depth-Informed Trajectory Refinement for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17323v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a crucial component of robotic perception, yet existing Tracking-By-Detection (TBD) methods often rely on 2D cues, such as bounding boxes and motion modeling, which struggle under occlusions and close-proximity interactions. Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Object Tracking Incorporating Transfer Learning into Unscented and Cubature Kalman Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07157v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel filtering algorithm that employs Bayesian transfer learning to address the challenges posed by mismatched intensity of the noise in a pair of sensors, each of which tracks an object using a nonlinear dynamic system model. In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance, thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves superior accuracy, stability and generalization across varying safe distances, trajectories, and target velocities. Furthermore, a real-world experiment on a quadrotor with an onboard computer validated practicality of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VSE-MOT: Multi-Object Tracking in Low-Quality Video Scenes Guided by Visual Semantic Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14060v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Distractor-Aware Memory-Based Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13864v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent emergence of memory-based video segmentation methods such as SAM2 has led to models with excellent performance in segmentation tasks, achieving leading results on numerous benchmarks. However, these modes are not fully adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4% performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on Github: https://github.com/jovanavidenovic/DAM4SAM</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/jovanavidenovic/DAM4SAM) |

The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 page Journal paper, accepted by IEEE Open Access Journal of Power and Energy</p></details> | None |
| **[MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12924v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[T-SiamTPN: Temporal Siamese Transformer Pyramid Networks for Robust and Efficient UAV Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12913v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations, dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies, resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion. Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions, strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations. These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1 FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains: compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and efficient solution for aerial object tracking.

Computer vision systems capable of long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types. While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and PromptTrack. All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

MOT ensures consistent object identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS (MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic. Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization.

| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

| **[Motion Estimation for Multi-Object Tracking using KalmanNet with Semantic-Independent Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11323v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT). It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches. The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT. However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary. In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT. In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps. First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information. Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements. To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters. The code is available at (https://github.com/SongJgit/filternet and https://github.com/SongJgit/TBDTracker).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/SongJgit/filternet) |

However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking.

Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new 10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at: https://github.com/ngobibibnbe/uncertain-identity-aware-tracking</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, accepted at CVPR animal workshop 2024, submitted to IJCV</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ngobibibnbe/uncertain-identity-aware-tracking) |

This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[V-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17434v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

However, maintaining consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion. However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9% on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms.

While existing hyperspectral trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules (SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI) module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs. Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba) |

We formulate a variational inference problem to approximate the posterior density of the state conditioned on the measurement data. We view the unknown data association as a latent variable and apply Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain a filter with update step in the same form as the Kalman filter but with expanded measurement vector of all potential associations. We show that the association probabilities can be computed as permanents of matrices with measurement likelihood entries. We also propose an ambiguity check that associates only a subset of ambiguous measurements and states probabilistically, thus reducing the association time and preventing low-probability measurements from harming the estimation accuracy. Experiments in simulation show that our filter achieves lower tracking errors than the well-established joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), while running at comparable rate. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in multi-object tracking (MOT) on multiple real-world datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack. We achieve better higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) than previous Kalman-filter methods and remain real-time. Associating only bounding boxes without deep features or velocities, our method ranks top-10 on both MOT17 and MOT20 in terms of HOTA. Given offline detections, our algorithm tracks at 250+ fps on a single laptop CPU.

Fully-supervised learning methods are known to achieve excellent tracking performances, but acquiring identity-level annotations is tedious and time-consuming. Motivated by the fact that in real-world scenarios object motion can be usually represented by a Markov process, we present a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that trains a neural network to associate detections for tracking, without requiring prior knowledge of their temporal correspondences. At the core of our method lies a neural Kalman filter, with an observation model conditioned on associations of detections parameterized by a neural network. Given a batch of frames as input, data associations between detections from adjacent frames are predicted by a neural network followed by a Sinkhorn normalization that determines the assignment probabilities of detections to states. Kalman smoothing is then used to obtain the marginal probability of observations given the inferred states, producing a training objective to maximize this marginal probability using gradient descent. The proposed framework is fully differentiable, allowing the underlying neural model to be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our approach on the challenging MOT17, MOT20, and BDD100K datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to self-supervised trackers using public detections.</p></details> | BMVC2025 poster | None |

By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction, temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations. Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames. We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability, inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical large-scale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas \textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving \textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FeatureSORT: Essential Features for Effective Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04249v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FeatureSORT, a simple yet effective online multiple object tracker that reinforces the DeepSORT baseline with a redesigned detector and additional feature cues. In contrast to conventional detectors that only provide bounding boxes, our modified YOLOX architecture is extended to output multiple appearance attributes, including clothing color, clothing style, and motion direction, alongside the bounding boxes. These feature cues, together with a ReID network, form complementary embeddings that substantially improve association accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate stronger post-processing strategies, such as global linking and Gaussian Smoothing Process interpolation, to handle missing associations and detections. During online tracking, we define a measurement-to-track distance function that jointly considers IoU, direction, color, style, and ReID similarity. This design enables FeatureSORT to maintain consistent identities through longer occlusions while reducing identity switches. Extensive experiments on standard MOT benchmarks demonstrate that FeatureSORT achieves state-of-the-art online performance, with MOTA scores of 79.7 on MOT16, 80.6 on MOT17, 77.9 on MOT20, and 92.2 on DanceTrack, underscoring the effectiveness of feature-enriched detection and modular post processing in advancing multi-object tracking.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi Object Tracking for Predictive Collision Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02161v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safe and efficient operation of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in complex environments, such as manufacturing, logistics, and agriculture, necessitates accurate multi-object tracking and predictive collision avoidance. This paper presents algorithms and techniques for addressing these challenges using Lidar sensor data, emphasizing ensemble Kalman filter. The developed predictive collision avoidance algorithm employs the data provided by lidar sensors to track multiple objects and predict their velocities and future positions, enabling the AMR to navigate safely and effectively. A modification to the dynamic windowing approach is introduced to enhance the performance of the collision avoidance system. The overall system architecture encompasses object detection, multi-object tracking, and predictive collision avoidance control. The experimental results, obtained from both simulation and real-world data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in various scenarios, which lays the foundation for future research on global planners, other controllers, and the integration of additional sensors.

| **[TGOSPA Metric Parameters Selection and Evaluation for Visual Multi-object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08321v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking algorithms are deployed in various applications, each with different performance requirements. For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Springer International Journal of Computer Vision</p></details> | None |
| **[Multiple Object Detection and Tracking in Panoramic Videos for Cycling Safety Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15199v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyclists face a disproportionate risk of injury, yet conventional crash records are too limited to reconstruct the circumstances of incidents or to diagnose risk at the finer spatial and temporal detail needed for targeted interventions. Recently, naturalistic studies have gained traction as a way to capture the complex behavioural and infrastructural factors that contribute to crashes. These approaches typically involve the collection and analysis of video data. A video promising format is panoramic video, which can record 360-degree views around a rider. However, its use is limited by severe distortions, large numbers of small objects and boundary continuity. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel three-step framework: (1) enhancing object detection accuracy on panoramic imagery by segmenting and projecting the original 360-degree images into four perspective sub-images, thus reducing distortion; (2) modifying multi-object tracking models to incorporate boundary continuity and object category information for improved tracking consistency; and (3) validating the proposed approach through a real-world application focused on detecting overtaking manoeuvres by vehicles around cyclists. The methodology is evaluated using panoramic videos recorded by cyclists on London's roadways under diverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate notable improvements over baseline methods, achieving higher average precision across varying image resolutions. Moreover, the enhanced tracking approach yields a 3.0% increase in multi-object tracking accuracy and a 4.6% improvement in identification F-score. The overtaking detection task achieves a high F-score of 0.81, illustrating the practical effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world cycling safety scenarios.

However, existing datasets and methodologies primarily target mainstream team sports such as soccer and conventional 5-on-5 basketball, often overlooking scenarios involving fixed-camera setups commonly used at amateur levels, less mainstream sports, or datasets that explicitly incorporate pose annotations. In this paper, we propose the TrackID3x3 dataset, the first publicly available comprehensive dataset specifically designed for multi-player tracking, player identification, and pose estimation in 3x3 basketball scenarios. The dataset comprises three distinct subsets (Indoor fixed-camera, Outdoor fixed-camera, and Drone camera footage), capturing diverse full-court camera perspectives and environments. We also introduce the Track-ID task, a simplified variant of the game state reconstruction task that excludes field detection and focuses exclusively on fixed-camera scenarios. To evaluate performance, we propose a baseline algorithm called Track-ID algorithm, tailored to assess tracking and identification quality. Furthermore, our benchmark experiments, utilizing recent multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., BoT-SORT-ReID) and top-down pose estimation methods (HRNet, RTMPose, and SwinPose), demonstrate robust results and highlight remaining challenges. Our dataset and evaluation benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing automated analytics in 3x3 basketball.

However, this aspect of the problem is mostly overlooked or mitigated by employing two-stage association and utilizing low confidence detections in the second stage. Recently proposed BoostTrack attempts to avoid the drawbacks of multiple stage association approach and use low-confidence detections by applying detection confidence boosting. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the confidence boost used in BoostTrack and propose a method to improve its performance. To construct a richer similarity measure and enable a better selection of true positive detections, we propose to use a combination of shape, Mahalanobis distance and novel soft BIoU similarity. We propose a soft detection confidence boost technique which calculates new confidence scores based on the similarity measure and the previous confidence scores, and we introduce varying similarity threshold to account for lower similarity measure between detections and tracklets which are not regularly updated. The proposed additions are mutually independent and can be used in any MOT algorithm. Combined with the BoostTrack+ baseline, our method achieves near state of the art results on the MOT17 dataset and new state of the art HOTA and IDF1 scores on the MOT20 dataset.

It becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range, that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

The state-of-the-art approaches usually employ a tracking-by-detection method, and data association plays a critical role. This paper proposes a learning and graph-optimized (LEGO) modular tracker to improve data association performance in the existing literature. The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames. To further enhance the state update process, the Kalman filter is added to ensure consistent tracking by incorporating temporal coherence in the object states. Our proposed method utilizing LiDAR alone has shown exceptional performance compared to other online tracking approaches, including LiDAR-based and LiDAR-camera fusion-based methods.

The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed, including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is, in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and the data is revealed.

Despite doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles, previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format of the fast racket sport.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures | None |

This paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally, MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection, modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation. Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities, laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth (D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT), covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets, revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal categories when compared with RGB datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first comprehensive survey for multi-modal visual object tracking; 6 multi-modal tasks; 338 references</p></details> | None |

However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-State Tracker: Enhancing Efficient Object Tracking via Multi-State Specialization and Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11531v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG) and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD) design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on the GOT-10K dataset.

A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing practices mix all data sensor types in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks, causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data, reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by 27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format, progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity. Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for future multi-modal vision research.

We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa) |

While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.</p></details> |  | None |

STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT).

| **[MeMoSORT: Memory-Assisted Filtering and Motion-Adaptive Association Metric for Multi-Person Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09796v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter (MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU (Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of 67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Offline Auto Labeling: BAAS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09585v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces BAAS, a new Extended Object Tracking (EOT) and fusion-based label annotation framework for radar detections in autonomous driving. Our framework utilizes Bayesian-based tracking, smoothing and eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic objects and class types</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SOI is the Root of All Evil: Quantifying and Breaking Similar Object Interference in Single Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09524v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements (AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU) benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of 2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and robotic applications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures | None |

To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation. Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance, significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent occlusions and intricate motion patterns.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SUIT: Spatial-Spectral Union-Intersection Interaction Network for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07250v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance.

Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR and KITTI show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS methods still struggle under real-world complexities.

| **[Head Anchor Enhanced Detection and Association for Crowded Pedestrian Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05514v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection features from both the regression and classification branches of an object detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions, integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes. By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded environments where occlusions are prevalent.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in some real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association. Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we first propose a new long-term, large-scale frame-event visual object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 1,044 long-term videos that involve 1.9 million RGB frames and event stream pairs, 60 different target objects, and 14 challenging attributes. To build a solid benchmark, we retrain and evaluate 21 baseline trackers on our dataset for future work to compare. In addition, we propose a novel Associative Memory Transformer based RGB-Event long-term visual tracker, termed AMTTrack. It follows a one-stream tracking framework and aggregates the multi-scale RGB/event template and search tokens effectively via the Hopfield retrieval layer. The framework also embodies another aspect of associative memory by maintaining dynamic template representations through an associative memory update scheme, which addresses the appearance variation in long-term tracking. Extensive experiments on FELT, FE108, VisEvent, and COESOT datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed tracker.

We present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves an average of 50%.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses, and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view synthesis over baseline approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory. Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction through activity quantification and behavioural classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in Smart Agriculture Technology</p></details> | None |

In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional reactive methods, these systems rely on real-time sensing, trajectory prediction, and intelligent infrastructure to detect potential hazards. Existing simulation-based studies often overlook, and real-world deployment studies rarely discuss the practical challenges associated with deploying such systems in operational settings, particularly those involving roadside infrastructure and multi-sensor integration and fusion. This study addresses that gap by presenting deployment insights and technical lessons learned from a real-world implementation of a multi-sensor safety system at an active bridge repair work zone along the N-2/US-75 corridor in Lincoln, Nebraska. The deployed system combines LiDAR, radar, and camera sensors with an edge computing platform to support multi-modal object tracking, trajectory fusion, and real-time analytics. Specifically, this study presents key lessons learned across three critical stages of deployment: (1) sensor selection and placement, (2) sensor calibration, system integration, and validation, and (3) sensor fusion. Additionally, we propose a predictive digital twin framework that leverages fused trajectory data for early conflict detection and real-time warning generation, enabling proactive safety interventions.</p></details> |  | None |

Classical closed-vocabulary MOT (CV-MOT) methods aim to track objects of predefined categories. Recently, some open-vocabulary MOT (OV-MOT) methods have successfully addressed the problem of tracking unknown categories. However, we found that the CV-MOT and OV-MOT methods each struggle to excel in the tasks of the other. In this paper, we present a unified framework, Associate Everything Detected (AED), that simultaneously tackles CV-MOT and OV-MOT by integrating with any off-the-shelf detector and supports unknown categories. Different from existing tracking-by-detection MOT methods, AED gets rid of prior knowledge (e.g. motion cues) and relies solely on highly robust feature learning to handle complex trajectories in OV-MOT tasks while keeping excellent performance in CV-MOT tasks. Specifically, we model the association task as a similarity decoding problem and propose a sim-decoder with an association-centric learning mechanism. The sim-decoder calculates similarities in three aspects: spatial, temporal, and cross-clip. Subsequently, association-centric learning leverages these threefold similarities to ensure that the extracted features are appropriate for continuous tracking and robust enough to generalize to unknown categories. Compared with existing powerful OV-MOT and CV-MOT methods, AED achieves superior performance on TAO, SportsMOT, and DanceTrack without any prior knowledge.

However, conventional tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes, which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on nuScenes 3D MOT.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated. In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14 distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness, but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3) The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[YOLOO: You Only Learn from Others Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00618v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) typically necessitates extensive computational costs of deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract multi-modal representations. In this paper, we propose an intriguing question: May we learn from multiple modalities only during training to avoid multi-modal input in the inference phase? To answer it, we propose \textbf{YOLOO}, a novel multi-modal 3D MOT paradigm: You Only Learn from Others Once. YOLOO empowers the point cloud encoder to learn a unified tri-modal representation (UTR) from point clouds and other modalities, such as images and textual cues, all at once. Leveraging this UTR, YOLOO achieves efficient tracking solely using the point cloud encoder without compromising its performance, fundamentally obviating the need for computationally intensive DNNs. Specifically, YOLOO includes two core components: a unified tri-modal encoder (UTEnc) and a flexible geometric constraint (F-GC) module. UTEnc integrates a point cloud encoder with image and text encoders adapted from pre-trained CLIP. It seamlessly fuses point cloud information with rich visual-textual knowledge from CLIP into the point cloud encoder, yielding highly discriminative UTRs that facilitate the association between trajectories and detections. Additionally, F-GC filters out mismatched associations with similar representations but significant positional discrepancies. It further enhances the robustness of UTRs without requiring any scene-specific tuning, addressing a key limitation of customized geometric constraints (e.g., 3D IoU). Lastly, high-quality 3D trajectories are generated by a traditional data association component. By integrating these advancements into a multi-modal 3D MOT scheme, our YOLOO achieves substantial gains in both robustness and efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only 35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCVW2025</p></details> | None |

Over the past two decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers, discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks, highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 29 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |

However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds due to their structure or other issues. To address this problem, we revisited the Joint Detection and Tracking (JDT) method by looking back at past approaches. By integrating the original JDT approach with some advanced theories, this paper employs an efficient method of information transfer between frames on the DETR, constructing a fast and novel JDT-type MOT framework: FastTrackTr. Thanks to the superiority of this information transfer method, our approach not only reduces the number of queries required during tracking but also avoids the excessive introduction of network structures, ensuring model simplicity. Experimental results indicate that our method has the potential to achieve real-time tracking and exhibits competitive tracking accuracy across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches often struggle to balance accuracy and speed, particularly in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages advanced spatial-temporal modeling techniques for simultaneous action recognition and object tracking. Our approach builds upon recent advances in parallel sequence modeling and introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant spatial regions across temporal sequences. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and MOT17 datasets show improvements of 3.2% in action recognition accuracy and 2.8% in tracking precision compared to existing methods, with 40% faster inference time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SAMITE: Position Prompted SAM2 with Calibrated Memory for Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21732v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training, showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules, including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results, and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate, their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE) |

However, recent developments still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain, particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field angular-temporal modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing systems predominantly rely on body gestures or speech to control visualizations, leaving interactions with physical objects largely underexplored. We introduce augmented physical data storytelling, an approach enabling presenters to manipulate visualizations through physical object interactions. To inform this approach, we first conducted a survey of data-driven presentations to identify common visualization commands. We then conducted workshops with nine HCI/VIS researchers to collect mappings between physical manipulations and these commands. Guided by these insights, we developed InSituTale, a prototype that combines object tracking via a depth camera with Vision-LLM for detecting real-world events. Through physical manipulations, presenters can dynamically execute various visualization commands, delivering cohesive data storytelling experiences that blend physical and digital elements. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated that InSituTale enables intuitive interactions, offers high utility, and facilitates an engaging presentation experience.</p></details> |  | None |

Current category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics. Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of large-scale pretrained models in this field.</p></details> |  | None |

This intricate task involves reasoning on multi-modal data and precise target localization with temporal association. However, prior studies overlook the imbalanced data distribution between newborn targets and existing targets due to the nature of the task. In addition, they only indirectly fuse multi-modal features, struggling to deliver clear guidance on newborn target detection. To solve the above issues, we conduct a collaborative matching strategy to alleviate the impact of the imbalance, boosting the ability to detect newborn targets while maintaining tracking performance. In the encoder, we integrate and enhance the cross-modal and multi-scale fusion, overcoming the bottlenecks in previous work, where limited multi-modal information is shared and interacted between feature maps. In the decoder, we also develop a referring-infused adaptation that provides explicit referring guidance through the query tokens. The experiments showcase the superior performance of our model (+3.42%) compared to prior works, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components: Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance. Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP and 32.8\% AMOTA.

However, existing VOS models often struggle with precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i) leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and (iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including, coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover, HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object dynamics over extended temporal durations.</p></details> | submit/6651762 | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively.

We aim to bring that technology to field operators in the field who require flexible, high-performance edge AI system that can be adapted on a moment's notice. This paper introduces CHAMP (Configurable Hot-swappable Architecture for Machine Perception), a modular edge computing platform that allows operators to dynamically swap in specialized AI "capability cartridges" for tasks like face recognition, object tracking, and document analysis. CHAMP leverages low-power FPGA-based accelerators on a high-throughput bus, orchestrated by a custom operating system (VDiSK) to enable plug-and-play AI pipelines and cryptographically secured biometric datasets. In this paper we describe the CHAMP design, including its modular scaling with multiple accelerators and the VDiSK operating system for runtime reconfiguration, along with its cryptographic capabilities to keep data stored on modules safe and private. Experiments demonstrate near-linear throughput scaling from 1 to 5 neural compute accelerators, highlighting both the performance gains and saturation limits of the USB3-based bus. Finally, we discuss applications of CHAMP in field biometrics, surveillance, and disaster response, and outline future improvements in bus protocols, cartridge capabilities, and system software.</p></details> |  | None |

While monitoring tasks have traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space (object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models. However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use and further development.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing formulations assume an "offline" setting with full video access at query time, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios with power and storage-constrained wearable devices. Towards more application-ready episodic memory systems, we introduce Online Visual Query 2D (OVQ2D), a task where models process video streams online, observing each frame only once, and retrieve object localizations using a compact memory instead of full video history. We address OVQ2D with ESOM (Egocentric Streaming Object Memory), a novel framework integrating an object discovery module, an object tracking module, and a memory module that find, track, and store spatio-temporal object information for efficient querying. Experiments on Ego4D demonstrate ESOM's superiority over other online approaches, though OVQ2D remains challenging, with top performance at only ~4% success. ESOM's accuracy increases markedly with perfect object tracking (31.91%), discovery (40.55%), or both (81.92%), underscoring the need of applied research on these components.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent research has benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However, these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted advancements on this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)</p></details> | None |

The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking.

In particular, one quasi-metric is an extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.</p></details> |  | None |

The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)} mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

Single-agent tracking offers resilience to adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

However, existing human part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3% acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was limited to parsing fixed classes.</p></details> |  | None |

As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation.

However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank, enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions, and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2 that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules for memory control in visual object tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

Experimental results show consistent improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model, achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2, and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the effectiveness of our trainless, low-overhead improvements for boosting long-term tracking performance.

However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, prior work has focused evaluations on semantic-related tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ action classification, ImageNet classification, etc. In this paper we focus on evaluating self-supervised learning on non-semantic vision tasks that are more spatial (3D) and temporal (+1D = 4D), such as camera pose estimation, point and object tracking, and depth estimation. We show that by learning from very large video datasets, masked auto-encoding (MAE) with transformer video models actually scales, consistently improving performance on these 4D tasks, as model size increases from 20M all the way to the largest by far reported self-supervised video model $\unicode{x2013}$ 22B parameters.

While cooperative multi-user SLAM has demonstrated potential in leveraging distributed sensing, its application within multi-modal ISAC systems remains limited, particularly in terms of theoretical modeling and communication-layer integration. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal SLAM framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions. First, a Bayesian estimation framework is developed for cooperative multi-user SLAM, along with a two-stage algorithm for robust radio map construction under dynamic and heterogeneous sensing conditions. Second, a multi-modal localization strategy is introduced, fusing SLAM results with camera-based multi-object tracking and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data via an error-aware model, significantly improving UE localization in multi-user scenarios. Third, a sensing-aided beam management scheme is proposed, utilizing global radio maps and localization data to generate UE-specific prior information for beam selection, thereby reducing inter-user interference and enhancing downlink spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system improves radio map accuracy by up to 60%, enhances localization accuracy by 37.5%, and significantly outperforms traditional methods in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Communications</p></details> | None |

Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data sources.

Single-agent tracking offers resilience to adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected graph via differential coordinates and anchor points.

It capitalises on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification (GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning (including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly more from simulated data).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems</p></details> | None |
| **[CrowdTrack: A Benchmark for Difficult Multiple Pedestrian Tracking in Real Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02479v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them, pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information, non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution, the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33 videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the foundation models on our dataset.

Thermal sensors enhance recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution for real-world surveillance applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible.

In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba, leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First, we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query token and utilized for tracking in every scan.

Most of the existing approaches focus on learning target representation in well-conditioned daytime data, while for the unconstrained real-world scenarios with adverse weather conditions, e.g. nighttime or foggy environment, the tremendous domain shift leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose UMDATrack, which is capable of maintaining high-quality target state prediction under various adverse weather conditions within a unified domain adaptation framework. Specifically, we first use a controllable scenario generator to synthesize a small amount of unlabeled videos (less than 2% frames in source daytime datasets) in multiple weather conditions under the guidance of different text prompts. Afterwards, we design a simple yet effective domain-customized adapter (DCA), allowing the target objects' representation to rapidly adapt to various weather conditions without redundant model updating. Furthermore, to enhance the localization consistency between source and target domains, we propose a target-aware confidence alignment module (TCA) following optimal transport theorem.

However, existing approaches often struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency, spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences.

However, most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction, cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e., FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed tracking framework.

However, these solutions often sacrifice accuracy for speed to a great extent, and also have the problems of complex training process and structural limitations. Thus, we propose a general model compression framework for efficient transformer object tracking, named CompressTracker, to reduce model size while preserving tracking accuracy. Our approach features a novel stage division strategy that segments the transformer layers of the teacher model into distinct stages to break the limitation of model structure. Additionally, we also design a unique replacement training technique that randomly substitutes specific stages in the student model with those from the teacher model, as opposed to training the student model in isolation. Replacement training enhances the student model's ability to replicate the teacher model's behavior and simplifies the training process. To further forcing student model to emulate teacher model, we incorporate prediction guidance and stage-wise feature mimicking to provide additional supervision during the teacher model's compression process. CompressTracker is structurally agnostic, making it compatible with any transformer architecture. We conduct a series of experiment to verify the effectiveness and generalizability of our CompressTracker. Our CompressTracker-SUTrack, compressed from SUTrack, retains about 99 performance on LaSOT (72.2 AUC) while achieves 2.42x speed up.

While TBD is decoupled and efficient, its fragmented association steps and heuristic matching pipelines often compromise robustness in complex scenarios. TBQ provides stronger semantic modeling through end-to-end learning, but suffers from high training cost and slow inference due to tight coupling between detection and association. To address these challenges, we propose TBDQ-Net, a unified tracking-by-detection-and-query (TBDQ) framework that effectively combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method efficiently integrates pretrained, high-performance detectors with an MOT-tailored associator. The associator is lightweight and directly fetches information from the inference of detectors, enhancing the overall efficiency of the framework. The associator is also learnable, making it essential for fully end-to-end optimization, ensuring robust tracking capabilities. Specifically, the associator comprises two key modules: basic information interaction (BII) for comprehensive semantic interaction, and content-position alignment (CPA) for semantic and positional consistency. TBDQ-Net's effectiveness is extensively demonstrated on DanceTrack, SportsMOT and MOT20 benchmarks. As a structurally efficient and semantically robust tracking framework, it outperforms the leading TBD method by 6.0 IDF1 points on DanceTrack and achieves at least 37.5% faster inference than prominent TBQ methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving Token-based Object Detection with Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22562v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck.

However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities. And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures | None |

However, the study of the fundamental event data association problem is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a novel Event Data Association (called EDA) approach to explicitly address the event association and fusion problem. The proposed EDA seeks for event trajectories that best fit the event data, in order to perform unifying data association and information fusion. In EDA, we first asynchronously fuse the event data based on its information entropy. Then, we introduce a deterministic model hypothesis generation strategy, which effectively generates model hypotheses from the fused events, to represent the corresponding event trajectories. After that, we present a two-stage weighting algorithm, which robustly weighs and selects true models from the generated model hypotheses, through multi-structural geometric model fitting. Meanwhile, we also propose an adaptive model selection strategy to automatically determine the number of the true models. Finally, we use the selected true models to associate and fuse the event data, without being affected by sensor noise and irrelevant structures. We evaluate the performance of the proposed EDA on the object tracking task. The experimental results show the effectiveness of EDA under challenging scenarios, such as high speed, motion blur, and high dynamic range conditions.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures | None |

To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces effective feature representations that support more accurate target localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed. Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second. This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

Building on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions, RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition, RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.

To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel representation, extended bounding field-of-view (eBFoV), for target localization and use it as the foundation of a general 360 tracking framework which is applicable for both omnidirectional visual object tracking and segmentation tasks. Building upon our previous work on omnidirectional visual object tracking (360VOT), we propose a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that incorporates a new component called omnidirectional video object segmentation (360VOS). The 360VOS dataset includes 290 sequences accompanied by dense pixel-wise masks and covers a broader range of target categories. To support both the development and evaluation of algorithms in this domain, we divide the dataset into a training subset with 170 sequences and a testing subset with 120 sequences. Furthermore, we tailor evaluation metrics for both omnidirectional tracking and segmentation to ensure rigorous assessment. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 360 tracking framework and training dataset.

In comparison to the previous state-of-the-art, KARL (1) incorporates a novel six-stage RL curriculum that doubles the system's motion range, thereby greatly enhancing the system's grasping performance, (2) integrates a robust Kalman filter layer between the perception and reinforcement learning (RL) control modules, enabling the system to maintain an uncertain but continuous 6D pose estimate even when the target object temporarily exits the camera's field-of-view or undergoes rapid, unpredictable motion, and (3) introduces mechanisms to allow retries to gracefully recover from unavoidable policy execution failures. Extensive evaluations conducted in both simulation and real-world experiments qualitatively and quantitatively corroborate KARL's advantage over earlier systems, achieving higher grasp success rates and faster robot execution speed.

This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |

The rise of deep learning has significantly advanced MOT, particularly within the tracking-by-detection paradigm, which remains the dominant approach. Advancements in modern deep learning-based methods accelerated in 2022 with the introduction of ByteTrack for tracking-by-detection and MOTR for end-to-end tracking. Our survey provides an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based MOT methods, systematically categorizing tracking-by-detection approaches into five groups: joint detection and embedding, heuristic-based, motion-based, affinity learning, and offline methods. In addition, we examine end-to-end tracking methods and compare them with existing alternative approaches. We evaluate the performance of recent trackers across multiple benchmarks and specifically assess their generality by comparing results across different domains. Our findings indicate that heuristic-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results on densely populated datasets with linear object motion, while deep learning-based association methods, in both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end approaches, excel in scenarios with complex motion patterns.</p></details> | 39 pages | None |

Over the years, end-to-end methods based on the traditional transformer structure, like MOTR, have achieved remarkable performance in multi-object tracking. However,The substantial computational resource consumption of these methods, coupled with the optimization challenges posed by dynamic data, results in less favorable inference speeds and training times. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper optimized the network architecture and proposed an effective training strategy to mitigate the problem of prolonged training times, thereby developing DecoderTrack, a novel end-to-end tracking method. Subsequently, to tackle the optimization challenges arising from dynamic data, this paper introduced DecoderTrack+ by incorporating a Fixed-Size Query Memory and refining certain attention layers. Our methods, without any bells and whistles, outperforms MOTR on multiple benchmarks, with inference speeds 2.06 and 3.03 times faster than MOTR, respectively</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiple Object Tracking in Video SAR: A Benchmark and Tracking Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12105v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of multi-object tracking using video synthetic aperture radar (Video SAR), Doppler shifts induced by target motion result in artifacts that are easily mistaken for shadows caused by static occlusions. Moreover, appearance changes of the target caused by Doppler mismatch may lead to association failures and disrupt trajectory continuity. A major limitation in this field is the lack of public benchmark datasets for standardized algorithm evaluation. To address the above challenges, we collected and annotated 45 video SAR sequences containing moving targets, and named the Video SAR MOT Benchmark (VSMB). Specifically, to mitigate the effects of trailing and defocusing in moving targets, we introduce a line feature enhancement mechanism that emphasizes the positive role of motion shadows and reduces false alarms induced by static occlusions. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of target appearance variations, we propose a motion-aware clue discarding mechanism that substantially improves tracking robustness in Video SAR. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VSMB, and the dataset and model are released at https://github.com/softwarePupil/VSMB.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/softwarePupil/VSMB) |

Current tracking algorithms can be divided into two main categories: some approaches introduce complex heuristics and re-identification models to improve the tracking accuracy and reduce the number of identification switches, without particular attention to the timing performance, whereas other approaches are aimed at reducing response times by removing the re-identification phase, thus penalizing the tracking accuracy. This work proposes a new approach to multi-class object tracking that allows achieving smaller and more predictable execution times, without penalizing the tracking performance. The idea is to reduce the problem of matching predictions with detections into smaller sub-problems by splitting the Hungarian matrix by class and invoking the second re-identification stage only when strictly necessary for a smaller number of elements. The proposed solution was evaluated in complex urban scenarios with several objects of different types (as cars, trucks, bikes, and pedestrians), showing the effectiveness of the multi-class approach with respect to state of the art trackers.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures | None |

Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles. By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset, where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks, including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various testing sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops, 3DMM - 3D Multimedia Analytics, Search and Generation</p></details> | None |

This work addresses two pivotal challenges, namely, the implementation and the orchestration of the migration process. We first introduce a novel framework that efficiently implements stateful migration and effectively orchestrates the migration process by fulfilling both network and application KPI targets. Through experimental validation using realistic microservices, we then show that our solution (i) greatly improves migration performance, yielding up to 77% decrease of the migration downtime with respect to the state of the art, and (ii) successfully addresses the strict user QoE requirements of critical scenarios featuring latency-sensitive microservices. Further, we consider two practical use cases, featuring, respectively, a UAV autopilot microservice and a multi-object tracking task, and demonstrate how our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in configuring the migration process and in meeting KPI targets.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this bottleneck, we introduce SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives, our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments, making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches fall short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Effective matching mitigates perception errors, enhancing object identification and tracking for improved performance and safety. However, traditional metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Center Point Distances (CPDs), which are effective in 2D image planes, often fail to find critical matches in complex 3D scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce Contour Errors (CEs), an ego or object-centric metric for identifying matches of interest in tracking scenarios from a functional perspective. By comparing bounding boxes in the ego vehicle's frame, contour errors provide a more functionally relevant assessment of object matches. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that contour errors improve the reliability of matches over the state-of-the-art 2D IoU and CPD metrics in tracking-by-detection methods. In 3D car tracking, our results show that Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges and 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.</p></details> |  | None |

Predicting player positions in such scenarios is particularly difficult due to the observed highly non-linear motion patterns. Current methods are heavily reliant on object detection and appearance-based tracking, which struggle to perform in complex team sports scenarios, where appearance cues are ambiguous and motion patterns do not necessarily follow a linear pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce SportMamba, an adaptive hybrid MOT technique specifically designed for tracking in dynamic team sports. The technical contribution of SportMamba is twofold. First, we introduce a mamba-attention mechanism that models non-linear motion by implicitly focusing on relevant embedding dependencies. Second, we propose a height-adaptive spatial association metric to reduce ID switches caused by partial occlusions by accounting for scale variations due to depth changes. Additionally, we extend the detection search space with adaptive buffers to improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. Our proposed technique, SportMamba, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the SportsMOT dataset, which is characterized by complex motion and severe occlusion.

Despite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments continue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections, low-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent occlusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking Dataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically designed for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences, totaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object classes: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset captures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios, reflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated 14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed substantial performance degradation compared to their performance on general-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models demonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of domain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized tracking contexts.

In this paper, we extensively investigate the robustness of existing RGBD-based 6DoF pose estimation methods against varying levels of depth sensor noise. We highlight that existing 6DoF pose estimation methods suffer significant performance discrepancies due to depth measurement inaccuracies. In response to the robustness issue, we present a simple and effective transformer-based 6DoF pose estimation approach called DTTDNet, featuring a novel geometric feature filtering module and a Chamfer distance loss for training. Moreover, we advance the field of robust 6DoF pose estimation and introduce a new dataset -- Digital Twin Tracking Dataset Mobile (DTTD-Mobile), tailored for digital twin object tracking with noisy depth data from the mobile RGBD sensor suite of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTTDNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods at least 4.32, up to 60.74 points in ADD metrics on the DTTD-Mobile. More importantly, our approach exhibits superior robustness to varying levels of measurement noise, setting a new benchmark for robustness to measurement noise.

However, tracking in sports is challenging due to fast movements, occlusions, and camera shifts. Traditional tracking-by-detection methods require extensive tuning, while segmentation-based approaches struggle with track processing. We propose McByte, a tracking-by-detection framework that integrates temporally propagated segmentation mask as an association cue to improve robustness without per-video tuning. Unlike many existing methods, McByte does not require training, relying solely on pre-trained models and object detectors commonly used in the community.

Without using 3D features, they are ineffective in scenarios with occlusions or visually similar objects. To address this, our paper presents a novel depth-aware framework for MOT. We estimate depth using a zero-shot approach and incorporate it as an independent feature in the association process. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Alignment Score that refines IoU by integrating both coarse bounding box overlap and fine-grained (pixel-level) alignment to improve association accuracy without requiring additional learnable parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first MOT framework to incorporate 3D features (monocular depth) as an independent decision matrix in the association step. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks without any training nor fine-tuning.

| **[Camouflaged Object Tracking: A Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13877v4)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual tracking has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by the availability of large-scale training datasets that have enabled the development of highly accurate and robust algorithms. While significant progress has been made in tracking general objects, research on more challenging scenarios, such as tracking camouflaged objects, remains limited. Camouflaged objects, which blend seamlessly with their surroundings or other objects, present unique challenges for detection and tracking in complex environments. This challenge is particularly critical in applications such as military, security, agriculture, and marine monitoring, where precise tracking of camouflaged objects is essential. To address this gap, we introduce the Camouflaged Object Tracking Dataset (COTD), a specialized benchmark designed specifically for evaluating camouflaged object tracking methods. The COTD dataset comprises 200 sequences and approximately 80,000 frames, each annotated with detailed bounding boxes. Our evaluation of 20 existing tracking algorithms reveals significant deficiencies in their performance with camouflaged objects. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework, HiPTrack-MLS, which demonstrates promising results in improving tracking performance for camouflaged objects. COTD and code are avialable at https://github.com/openat25/HIPTrack-MLS.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/openat25/HIPTrack-MLS) |
| **[SSF-Net: Spatial-Spectral Fusion Network with Spectral Angle Awareness for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05852v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral video (HSV) offers valuable spatial, spectral, and temporal information simultaneously, making it highly suitable for handling challenges such as background clutter and visual similarity in object tracking. However, existing methods primarily focus on band regrouping and rely on RGB trackers for feature extraction, resulting in limited exploration of spectral information and difficulties in achieving complementary representations of object features. In this paper, a spatial-spectral fusion network with spectral angle awareness (SST-Net) is proposed for hyperspectral (HS) object tracking. Firstly, to address the issue of insufficient spectral feature extraction in existing networks, a spatial-spectral feature backbone ($S^2$FB) is designed. With the spatial and spectral extraction branch, a joint representation of texture and spectrum is obtained. Secondly, a spectral attention fusion module (SAFM) is presented to capture the intra- and inter-modality correlation to obtain the fused features from the HS and RGB modalities. It can incorporate the visual information into the HS spectral context to form a robust representation. Thirdly, to ensure a more accurate response of the tracker to the object position, a spectral angle awareness module (SAAM) investigates the region-level spectral similarity between the template and search images during the prediction stage. Furthermore, we develop a novel spectral angle awareness loss (SAAL) to offer guidance for the SAAM based on similar regions. Finally, to obtain the robust tracking results, a weighted prediction method is considered to combine the HS and RGB predicted motions of objects to leverage the strengths of each modality. Extensive experiments on the HOTC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SSF-Net, compared with state-of-the-art trackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 2025</p></details> | None |

While existing 3D object detection approaches operate globally and implicitly rely on the a priori existence of metric camera poses, our method, Rooms from Motion (RfM) operates on a collection of un-posed images. By replacing the standard 2D keypoint-based matcher of structure-from-motion with an object-centric matcher based on image-derived 3D boxes, we estimate metric camera poses, object tracks, and finally produce a global, semantic 3D object map. When a priori pose is available, we can significantly improve map quality through optimization of global 3D boxes against individual observations. RfM shows strong localization performance and subsequently produces maps of higher quality than leading point-based and multi-view 3D object detection methods on CA-1M and ScanNet++, despite these global methods relying on overparameterization through point clouds or dense volumes. Rooms from Motion achieves a general, object-centric representation which not only extends the work of Cubify Anything to full scenes but also allows for inherently sparse localization and parametric mapping proportional to the number of objects in a scene.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11496v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a significant application of multi-source information fusion in intelligent transportation perception systems, Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) involves localizing and tracking specific objects in video sequences based on language references. However, existing RMOT approaches often treat language descriptions as holistic embeddings and struggle to effectively integrate the rich semantic information contained in language expressions with visual features. This limitation is especially apparent in complex scenes requiring comprehensive understanding of both static object attributes and spatial motion information. In this paper, we propose a Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CDRMT) framework that addresses these challenges. It adapts the "what" and "where" pathways from the human visual processing system to RMOT tasks. Specifically, our framework first establishes cross-modal connections while preserving modality-specific characteristics. It then disentangles language descriptions and hierarchically injects them into object queries, refining object understanding from coarse to fine-grained semantic levels. Finally, we reconstruct language representations based on visual features, ensuring that tracked objects faithfully reflect the referring expression. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDRMT achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 6.0% in HOTA score on Refer-KITTI and 3.2% on Refer-KITTI-V2. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art in RMOT while simultaneously providing new insights into multi-source information fusion.</p></details> | 27 pages, 12 figures | None |

This requires mechanisms that can both identify semantically related objects across images and accurately produce segmentation masks. We note that Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), with its prompt-and-propagate mechanism, offers both strong segmentation capabilities and a built-in feature matching process. However, we show that its representations are entangled with task-specific cues optimized for object tracking, which impairs its use for tasks requiring higher level semantic understanding. Our key insight is that, despite its class-agnostic pretraining, SAM2 already encodes rich semantic structure in its features. We propose SANSA (Semantically AligNed Segment Anything 2), a framework that makes this latent structure explicit, and repurposes SAM2 for few-shot segmentation through minimal task-specific modifications. SANSA achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot segmentation benchmarks specifically designed to assess generalization, outperforms generalist methods in the popular in-context setting, supports various prompts flexible interaction via points, boxes, or scribbles, and remains significantly faster and more compact than prior approaches.

However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

Traditional statistical model-based tracking methods rely on predefined motion models and assumptions about system noise distributions. Although computationally efficient, they often lack adaptability to varying traffic scenarios and require extensive manual design and parameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D multi-object tracking approach for vehicles, HybridTrack, which integrates a data-driven Kalman Filter (KF) within a tracking-by-detection paradigm. In particular, it learns the transition residual and Kalman gain directly from data, which eliminates the need for manual motion and stochastic parameter modeling. Validated on the real-world KITTI dataset, HybridTrack achieves 82.72% HOTA accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate our method under different configurations, achieving the fastest processing speed of 112 FPS. Consequently, HybridTrack eliminates the dependency on scene-specific designs while improving performance and maintaining real-time efficiency.

Its task form is to guide the models to track the objects that conform to the language instruction. However, the RMOT task commonly requires clear language instructions, such methods often fail to work when complex language instructions with reasoning characteristics appear. In this work, we propose a new task, called Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT). ReaMOT is a more challenging task that requires accurate reasoning about objects that match the language instruction with reasoning characteristic and tracking the objects' trajectories. To advance the ReaMOT task and evaluate the reasoning capabilities of tracking models, we construct ReaMOT Challenge, a reasoning-based multi-object tracking benchmark built upon 12 datasets. Specifically, it comprises 1,156 language instructions with reasoning characteristic, 423,359 image-language pairs, and 869 diverse scenes, which is divided into three levels of reasoning difficulty. In addition, we propose a set of evaluation metrics tailored for the ReaMOT task. Furthermore, we propose ReaTrack, a training-free framework for reasoning-based multi-object tracking based on large vision-language models (LVLM) and SAM2, as a baseline for the ReaMOT task. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Our empirical study reveals that while scaling each factor leads to significant improvements in tracking accuracy, naive training suffers from suboptimal optimization and limited iterative refinement. To address this issue, we introduce DT-Training, a progressive scaling framework that integrates small teacher transfer and dual-branch alignment to maximize model potential. The resulting scaled tracker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and transferability of the proposed method. Furthermore, we validate the broader applicability of our approach to additional tasks, underscoring its versatility beyond tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive - a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17.81fps for HD and 7.53fps on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200K+ annotated animal instances across 19K+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT.

While many research efforts have focused on architectural advancements, such as temporal attention mechanisms, there remains a notable gap in understanding how models capture and utilize temporal semantics for effective temporal feature extraction, especially in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We propose an automated LiDAR-based captioning procedure that focuses on the temporal dynamics of traffic participants. Our approach uses a rule-based system to extract essential details such as lane position and relative motion from object tracks, followed by a template-based caption generation. Our findings show that training SwinBERT, a video captioning model, using only front camera images and supervised with our template-based captions, specifically designed to encapsulate fine-grained temporal behavior, leads to improved temporal understanding consistently across three datasets. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that integrating LiDAR-based caption supervision significantly enhances temporal understanding, effectively addressing and reducing the inherent visual/static biases prevalent in current state-of-the-art model architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

Speeding up 3D ground truth generation for such challenging scenes is performance-critical yet very challenging. The difficulties include the sparsity of the captured pedestrian point cloud and a lack of suitable benchmarks for a specific system design study. To tackle the challenges, we first collect a new multi-view LiDAR-camera 3D multiple-object-tracking benchmark of highly crowded pedestrians for in-depth analysis. We then build an offboard auto-labeling system that reconstructs pedestrian trajectories from LiDAR point cloud and multi-view images. To improve the generalization power for crowded scenes and the performance for small objects, we propose to learn high-resolution representations that are density-aware and relationship-aware. Extensive experiments validate that our approach significantly improves the 3D pedestrian tracking performance towards higher auto-labeling efficiency.

When no global position information is available (e.g., indoor or GPS-denied environments), agents must align their coordinate frames before shared spatial information can be properly expressed and interpreted. Coordinate frame alignment is particularly difficult when robots have no initial alignment and are affected by odometry drift. To this end, we develop a novel multiple hypothesis algorithm, called TCAFF, for aligning the coordinate frames of neighboring robots. TCAFF considers potential alignments from associating sparse open-set object maps and leverages temporal consistency to determine an initial alignment and correct for drift, all without any initial knowledge of neighboring robot poses. We demonstrate TCAFF being used for frame alignment in a collaborative object tracking application on a team of four robots tracking six pedestrians and show that TCAFF enables robots to achieve a tracking accuracy similar to that of a system with ground truth localization.

For this purpose, we consider the Delaunay triangulation of template features as an useful tool through which to be guided in this iterative approach. The triangulation is treated as a graph and, starting from a single triangle, neighboring nodes are considered and the corresponding features are identified; then matches related to them are evaluated to determine if they are worthy to be grouped. This evaluation is based on local consistency criteria derived from geometric and photometric properties of local features. Our solution allows the identification of the object in situations where geometric models (e.g. homography) does not hold, thus enable the detection of objects such that the template is non planar or when it is planar but appears distorted in the image. We show that our approach performs just as well or better than application of homography-based RANSAC in scenarios in which distortion is nearly absent, while when the deformation becomes relevant our method shows better description performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis at Politecnico di Milano</p></details> | None |

However, such frame-based methods inherently face challenges in achieving low-latency performance and often fail in resource-constrained environments. Visual object tracking using bio-inspired event cameras has emerged as a promising research direction in recent years, offering distinct advantages for low-latency applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Slow-Fast Tracking paradigm that flexibly adapts to different operational requirements, termed SFTrack. The proposed framework supports two complementary modes, i.e., a high-precision slow tracker for scenarios with sufficient computational resources, and an efficient fast tracker tailored for latency-aware, resource-constrained environments. Specifically, our framework first performs graph-based representation learning from high-temporal-resolution event streams, and then integrates the learned graph-structured information into two FlashAttention-based vision backbones, yielding the slow and fast trackers, respectively. The fast tracker achieves low latency through a lightweight network design and by producing multiple bounding box outputs in a single forward pass. Finally, we seamlessly combine both trackers via supervised fine-tuning and further enhance the fast tracker's performance through a knowledge distillation strategy. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks, including FE240, COESOT, and EventVOT, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method across different real-world scenarios.

Traditional tracking systems often rely on hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA).

Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data. Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing 3D SOT methods typically adhere to a point-based processing pipeline, wherein the re-sampling operation invariably leads to either redundant or missing information, thereby impacting performance. To address these issues, we propose PillarTrack, a novel pillar-based 3D SOT framework. First, we transform sparse point clouds into dense pillars to preserve the local and global geometrics. Second, we propose a Pyramid-Encoded Pillar Feature Encoder (PE-PFE) design to enhance the robustness of pillar feature for translation/rotation/scale. Third, we present an efficient Transformer-based backbone from the perspective of modality differences. Finally, we construct our PillarTrack based on above designs. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves comparable performance on the KITTI and NuScenes datasets, significantly enhancing the performance of the baseline.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DIMM: Decoupled Multi-hierarchy Kalman Filter for 3D Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12340v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation is challenging for 3D object tracking with high maneuverability, as the target's state transition function changes rapidly, irregularly, and is unknown to the estimator. Existing work based on interacting multiple model (IMM) achieves more accurate estimation than single-filter approaches through model combination, aligning appropriate models for different motion modes of the target object over time. However, two limitations of conventional IMM remain unsolved. First, the solution space of the model combination is constrained as the target's diverse kinematic properties in different directions are ignored. Second, the model combination weights calculated by the observation likelihood are not accurate enough due to the measurement uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DIMM, to effectively combine estimates from different motion models in each direction, thus increasing the 3D object tracking accuracy. First, DIMM extends the model combination solution space of conventional IMM from a hyperplane to a hypercube by designing a 3D-decoupled multi-hierarchy filter bank, which describes the target's motion with various-order linear models. Second, DIMM generates more reliable combination weight matrices through a differentiable adaptive fusion network for importance allocation rather than solely relying on the observation likelihood; it contains an attention-based twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method with a hierarchical reward. Experiments demonstrate that DIMM significantly improves the tracking accuracy of existing state estimation methods by 31.61%~99.23%.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

Additionally, we present a benchmark covering these challenging object classes, providing high-quality annotations for evaluating both tracking and reconstruction performance.

| **[Just Functioning as a Hook for Two-Stage Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07516v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to localize target trajectories specified by natural language expressions in videos. Existing RMOT methods mainly follow two paradigms: one-stage strategies and two-stage ones. The former jointly trains tracking with referring but suffers from substantial computational overhead. Although the latter improves efficiency, it overlooks the inherent contextual aggregation capabilities of pre-trained visual backbones and takes a detour. Meanwhile, its fixed dual-tower architecture restricts compatibility with other visual / text backbones. To address these limitations, we propose JustHook, a novel hook-like framework for two-stage RMOT, which introduces two core components: (1) a Visual Feature Hook (VFH), enabling JustHook to extract context-rich local features directly from the original visual backbone like a hook; (2) a Parallel Combined Decoder (PCD), which transforms the passive cosine similarity measurement between independent modalities into active contrastive learning within the combined feature space. The proposed JustHook not only leverages the capabilities of pre-trained models but also breaks free from the constraints of inherent modality alignment, achieving strong scalability. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI and Refer-KITTI-V2 demonstrate that JustHook outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse encoder combinations, achieving a notable 7.77\% HOTA improvement on Refer-KITTI-V2. Code will be made available soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[S2-Track: A Simple yet Strong Approach for End-to-End 3D Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02147v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multiple object tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving perception. Recent end-to-end query-based trackers simultaneously detect and track objects, which have shown promising potential for the 3D MOT task. However, existing methods are still in the early stages of development and lack systematic improvements, failing to track objects in certain complex scenarios, like occlusions and the small size of target object's situations. In this paper, we first summarize the current end-to-end 3D MOT framework by decomposing it into three constituent parts: query initialization, query propagation, and query matching. Then we propose corresponding improvements, which lead to a strong yet simple tracker: S2-Track. Specifically, for query initialization, we present 2D-Prompted Query Initialization, which leverages predicted 2D object and depth information to prompt an initial estimate of the object's 3D location. For query propagation, we introduce an Uncertainty-aware Probabilistic Decoder to capture the uncertainty of complex environment in object prediction with probabilistic attention. For query matching, we propose a Hierarchical Query Denoising strategy to enhance training robustness and convergence. As a result, our S2-Track achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark, i.e., 66.3% AMOTA on test split, surpassing the previous best end-to-end solution by a significant margin of 8.9% AMOTA. We achieve 1st place on the nuScenes tracking task leaderboard.</p></details> |  | None |

Our framework integrates (1) a cross-domain detection loss, (2) a multi-scale module, and (3) a small receptive field detection mechanism. These innovations enhance detection by bridging the gap between large and small detectors, capturing high-frequency details at multiple scales during training, and using filters with small receptive fields to detect tiny heads.

In this paper, we present the Asynchronous Event Multi-Object Tracking (AEMOT) algorithm for detecting and tracking multiple objects by processing individual raw events asynchronously. AEMOT detects salient event blob features by identifying regions of consistent optical flow using a novel Field of Active Flow Directions built from the Surface of Active Events. Detected features are tracked as candidate objects using the recently proposed Asynchronous Event Blob (AEB) tracker in order to construct small intensity patches of each candidate object. A novel learnt validation stage promotes or discards candidate objects based on classification of their intensity patches, with promoted objects having their position, velocity, size, and orientation estimated at their event rate. We evaluate AEMOT on a new Bee Swarm Dataset, where it tracks dozens of small bees with precision and recall performance exceeding that of alternative event-based detection and tracking algorithms by over 37%.

Nevertheless, existing BGS techniques utilizing deep learning still encounter challenges with various background noises in videos, including variations in lighting, shifts in camera angles, and disturbances like air turbulence or swaying trees. To address this problem, we design a spiking autoencoder network, termed SAEN-BGS, based on noise resilience and time-sequence sensitivity of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance the separation of foreground and background. To eliminate unnecessary background noise and preserve the important foreground elements, we begin by creating the continuous spiking conv-and-dconv block, which serves as the fundamental building block for the decoder in SAEN-BGS. Moreover, in striving for enhanced energy efficiency, we introduce a novel self-distillation spiking supervised learning method grounded in ANN-to-SNN frameworks, resulting in decreased power consumption. In extensive experiments conducted on CDnet-2014 and DAVIS-2016 datasets, our approach demonstrates superior segmentation performance relative to other baseline methods, even when challenged by complex scenarios with dynamic backgrounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Pattern Recognition</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Accurate State Estimation: Kalman Filter Incorporating Motion Dynamics for 3D Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07254v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the critical lack of precision in state estimation in the Kalman filter for 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) and the ongoing challenge of selecting the appropriate motion model. Existing literature commonly relies on constant motion models for estimating the states of objects, neglecting the complex motion dynamics unique to each object. Consequently, trajectory division and imprecise object localization arise, especially under occlusion conditions. The core of these challenges lies in the limitations of the current Kalman filter formulation, which fails to account for the variability of motion dynamics as objects navigate their environments. This work introduces a novel formulation of the Kalman filter that incorporates motion dynamics, allowing the motion model to adaptively adjust according to changes in the object's movement. The proposed Kalman filter substantially improves state estimation, localization, and trajectory prediction compared to the traditional Kalman filter. This is reflected in tracking performance that surpasses recent benchmarks on the KITTI and Waymo Open Datasets, with margins of 0.56\% and 0.81\% in higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) and multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed Kalman filter consistently outperforms the baseline across various detectors. Additionally, it shows an enhanced capability in managing long occlusions compared to the baseline Kalman filter, achieving margins of 1.22\% in higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) and 1.55\% in multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) on the KITTI dataset. The formulation's efficiency is evident, with an additional processing time of only approximately 0.078 ms per frame, ensuring its applicability in real-time applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BihoT: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Hyperspectral Camouflaged Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12232v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral object tracking (HOT) has exhibited potential in various applications, particularly in scenes where objects are camouflaged. Existing trackers can effectively retrieve objects via band regrouping because of the bias in existing HOT datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing visual appearances rather than spectral characteristics. This bias allows the tracker to directly use the visual features obtained from the false-color images generated by hyperspectral images without the need to extract spectral features. To tackle this bias, we find that the tracker should focus on the spectral information when object appearance is unreliable. Thus, we provide a new task called hyperspectral camouflaged object tracking (HCOT) and meticulously construct a large-scale HCOT dataset, termed BihoT, which consists of 41,912 hyperspectral images covering 49 video sequences. The dataset covers various artificial camouflage scenes where objects have similar appearances, diverse spectrums, and frequent occlusion, making it a very challenging dataset for HCOT. Besides, a simple but effective baseline model, named spectral prompt-based distractor-aware network (SPDAN), is proposed, comprising a spectral embedding network (SEN), a spectral prompt-based backbone network (SPBN), and a distractor-aware module (DAM). Specifically, the SEN extracts spectral-spatial features via 3-D and 2-D convolutions. Then, the SPBN fine-tunes powerful RGB trackers with spectral prompts and alleviates the insufficiency of training samples. Moreover, the DAM utilizes a novel statistic to capture the distractor caused by occlusion from objects and background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SPDAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed BihoT and other HOT datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2025</p></details> | None |

While the integration of hierarchical lightweight networks has become a prevalent strategy for enhancing efficiency in UAV tracking, it often results in a significant drop in network capacity, which further exacerbates challenges in UAV scenarios, such as frequent occlusions and extreme changes in viewing angles. To address these issues, we introduce a novel family of UAV trackers, termed CGTrack, which combines explicit and implicit techniques to expand network capacity within a coarse-to-fine framework. Specifically, we first introduce a Hierarchical Feature Cascade (HFC) module that leverages the spirit of feature reuse to increase network capacity by integrating the deep semantic cues with the rich spatial information, incurring minimal computational costs while enhancing feature representation. Based on this, we design a novel Lightweight Gated Center Head (LGCH) that utilizes gating mechanisms to decouple target-oriented coordinates from previously expanded features, which contain dense local discriminative information. Extensive experiments on three challenging UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate that CGTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while running fast.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to perform semantically conditioned open vocabulary object tracking that is specifically designed to cope with the limitations of UAV hardware. Our approach has several advantages. It can run with verbal descriptions of the missing person, e.g., the color of the shirt, it does not require dedicated training to execute the mission and can efficiently track a potentially moving person. Our experimental results demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our approach.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Transformer-based assignment decision network for multiple object tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03571v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data association is a crucial component for any multiple object tracking (MOT) method that follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm. To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification.

Existing trackers often depend on cropped template regions and have limited motion modeling capabilities, which pose challenges when dealing with tiny targets. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective infrared tiny-object tracker that enhances tracking performance by integrating global detection and motion-aware learning with temporal priors. Our method is based on object detection and achieves significant improvements through two key innovations. First, we introduce frame dynamics, leveraging frame difference and optical flow to encode both prior target features and motion characteristics at the input level, enabling the model to better distinguish the target from background clutter. Second, we propose a trajectory constraint filtering strategy in the post-processing stage, utilizing spatio-temporal priors to suppress false positives and enhance tracking robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches across multiple metrics in challenging infrared UAV tracking scenarios.

To address these issues, this paper pro-poses a novel Siamese Motion Mamba Tracker (SMMT), which integrates a bidirectional state-space model and a self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce the Motion Mamba module into the Siamese architecture to ex-tract motion features and recover overlooked edge details using bidirectional modeling and self-attention. We propose a Siamese parameter-sharing strate-gy that allows certain convolutional layers to share weights. This approach reduces computational redundancy while preserving strong feature represen-tation. In addition, we design a motion edge-aware regression loss to improve tracking accuracy, especially for motion-blurred targets. Extensive experi-ments are conducted on four TIR tracking benchmarks, including LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR 2017.

A promising solution is to predict contours using a deep learning model and then allow users to refine them. However, most existing methods focus on in-domain scenarios, limiting their effectiveness for cross-domain annotation tasks. In this paper, we propose SiamAnno, a framework inspired by the use of Siamese networks in object tracking. SiamAnno leverages one-shot learning to annotate previously unseen objects by taking a bounding box as input and predicting object boundaries, which can then be adjusted by annotators. Trained on one dataset and tested on another without fine-tuning, SiamAnno achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, demonstrating its ability to handle domain and environment shifts in cross-domain tasks. We also provide more comprehensive results compared to previous work, establishing a strong baseline for future research.

SAM2MOT has two key advantages: zero-shot generalization, allowing it to work across datasets without fine-tuning, and strong object association, inherited from SAM2. To further improve performance, we integrate a trajectory manager system for precise object addition and removal, and a cross-object interaction module to handle occlusions. Experiments on DanceTrack, UAVDT, and BDD100K show state-of-the-art results.
