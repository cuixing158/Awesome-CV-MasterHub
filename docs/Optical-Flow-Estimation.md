| **[mmFlux: Crowd Flow Analytics with Commodity mmWave MIMO Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07331v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift, dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework, underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, severe distortions caused by sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP), significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup (DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/longliangLiu/PriOr-Flow.</p></details> | 11 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/longliangLiu/PriOr-Flow) |
| **[MEMFOF: High-Resolution Training for Memory-Efficient Multi-Frame Optical Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23151v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution (FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289, leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%.

| **[MOL: Joint Estimation of Micro-Expression, Optical Flow, and Landmark via Transformer-Graph-Style Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14511v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging problem, due to transient and subtle micro-expression (ME) actions. Most existing methods depend on hand-crafted features, key frames like onset, apex, and offset frames, or deep networks limited by small-scale and low-diversity datasets. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end micro-action-aware deep learning framework with advantages from transformer, graph convolution, and vanilla convolution. In particular, we propose a novel F5C block composed of fully-connected convolution and channel correspondence convolution to directly extract local-global features from a sequence of raw frames, without the prior knowledge of key frames. The transformer-style fully-connected convolution is proposed to extract local features while maintaining global receptive fields, and the graph-style channel correspondence convolution is introduced to model the correlations among feature patterns. Moreover, MER, optical flow estimation, and facial landmark detection are jointly trained by sharing the local-global features. The two latter tasks contribute to capturing facial subtle action information for MER, which can alleviate the impact of insufficient training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on CASME II, SAMM, and SMIC benchmarks, (ii) works well for optical flow estimation and facial landmark detection, and (iii) can capture facial subtle muscle actions in local regions associated with MEs.

| **[UFM: A Simple Path towards Unified Dense Correspondence with Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09278v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification. Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow & Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and 6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://uniflowmatch.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[Spatio-Temporal State Space Model For Efficient Event-Based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07878v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications. In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount. Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency. Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark.

| **[Flow-Anything: Learning Real-World Optical Flow Estimation from Large-Scale Single-view Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07740v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, serving as a foundation for video tasks. However, the real-world robustness is limited by animated synthetic datasets for training. This introduces domain gaps when applied to real-world applications and limits the benefits of scaling up datasets. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Flow-Anything}, a large-scale data generation framework designed to learn optical flow estimation from any single-view images in the real world. We employ two effective steps to make data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D representation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows us to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second, we develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware Inpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These two steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale single-view images, namely \textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we demonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from large-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised methods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models serve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream video tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GoTrack: Generic 6DoF Object Pose Refinement and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07155v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GoTrack, an efficient and accurate CAD-based method for 6DoF object pose refinement and tracking, which can handle diverse objects without any object-specific training. Unlike existing tracking methods that rely solely on an analysis-by-synthesis approach for model-to-frame registration, GoTrack additionally integrates frame-to-frame registration, which saves compute and stabilizes tracking. Both types of registration are realized by optical flow estimation. The model-to-frame registration is noticeably simpler than in existing methods, relying only on standard neural network blocks (a transformer is trained on top of DINOv2) and producing reliable pose confidence scores without a scoring network. For the frame-to-frame registration, which is an easier problem as consecutive video frames are typically nearly identical, we employ a light off-the-shelf optical flow model. We demonstrate that GoTrack can be seamlessly combined with existing coarse pose estimation methods to create a minimal pipeline that reaches state-of-the-art RGB-only results on standard benchmarks for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/gotrack</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/facebookresearch/gotrack) |
| **[EDCFlow: Exploring Temporally Dense Difference Maps for Event-based Optical Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03512v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent learning-based methods for event-based optical flow estimation utilize cost volumes for pixel matching but suffer from redundant computations and limited scalability to higher resolutions for flow refinement. In this work, we take advantage of the complementarity between temporally dense feature differences of adjacent event frames and cost volume and present a lightweight event-based optical flow network (EDCFlow) to achieve high-quality flow estimation at a higher resolution. Specifically, an attention-based multi-scale temporal feature difference layer is developed to capture diverse motion patterns at high resolution in a computation-efficient manner. An adaptive fusion of high-resolution difference motion features and low-resolution correlation motion features is performed to enhance motion representation and model generalization. Notably, EDCFlow can serve as a plug-and-play refinement module for RAFT-like event-based methods to enhance flow details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDCFlow achieves better performance with lower complexity compared to existing methods, offering superior generalization.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Learning Optical Flow Field via Neural Ordinary Differential Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03290v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on optical flow estimation use neural networks to predict the flow field that maps positions of one image to positions of the other. These networks consist of a feature extractor, a correlation volume, and finally several refinement steps. These refinement steps mimic the iterative refinements performed by classical optimization algorithms and are usually implemented by neural layers (e.g., GRU) which are recurrently executed for a fixed and pre-determined number of steps. However, relying on a fixed number of steps may result in suboptimal performance because it is not tailored to the input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for predicting the derivative of the flow using a continuous model, namely neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). One key advantage of this approach is its capacity to model an equilibrium process, dynamically adjusting the number of compute steps based on the data at hand. By following a particular neural architecture, ODE solver, and associated hyperparameters, our proposed model can replicate the exact same updates as recurrent cells used in existing works, offering greater generality. Through extensive experimental analysis on optical flow benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive improvement over baseline and existing models, all while requiring only a single refinement step.</p></details> | CVPRW 2025 | None |
| **[LinkTo-Anime: A 2D Animation Optical Flow Dataset from 3D Model Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02733v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing optical flow datasets focus primarily on real-world simulation or synthetic human motion, but few are tailored to Celluloid(cel) anime character motion: a domain with unique visual and motion characteristics. To bridge this gap and facilitate research in optical flow estimation and downstream tasks such as anime video generation and line drawing colorization, we introduce LinkTo-Anime, the first high-quality dataset specifically designed for cel anime character motion generated with 3D model rendering. LinkTo-Anime provides rich annotations including forward and backward optical flow, occlusion masks, and Mixamo Skeleton. The dataset comprises 395 video sequences, totally 24,230 training frames, 720 validation frames, and 4,320 test frames. Furthermore, a comprehensive benchmark is constructed with various optical flow estimation methods to analyze the shortcomings and limitations across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Correlation Volume Sampling for Ultra-High-Resolution Optical Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16942v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent optical flow estimation methods often employ local cost sampling from a dense all-pairs correlation volume. This results in quadratic computational and memory complexity in the number of pixels. Although an alternative memory-efficient implementation with on-demand cost computation exists, this is slower in practice and therefore prior methods typically process images at reduced resolutions, missing fine-grained details. To address this, we propose a more efficient implementation of the all-pairs correlation volume sampling, still matching the exact mathematical operator as defined by RAFT. Our approach outperforms on-demand sampling by up to 90% while maintaining low memory usage, and performs on par with the default implementation with up to 95% lower memory usage. As cost sampling makes up a significant portion of the overall runtime, this can translate to up to 50% savings for the total end-to-end model inference in memory-constrained environments. Our evaluation of existing methods includes an 8K ultra-high-resolution dataset and an additional inference-time modification of the recent SEA-RAFT method. With this, we achieve state-of-the-art results at high resolutions both in accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[V2V: Scaling Event-Based Vision through Efficient Video-to-Voxel Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16797v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. However, the massive storage requirements and I/O burdens of existing synthetic data generation pipelines and the scarcity of real data prevent event-based training datasets from scaling up, limiting the development and generalization capabilities of event vision models. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-to-Voxel (V2V), an approach that directly converts conventional video frames into event-based voxel grid representations, bypassing the storage-intensive event stream generation entirely. V2V enables a 150 times reduction in storage requirements while supporting on-the-fly parameter randomization for enhanced model robustness. Leveraging this efficiency, we train several video reconstruction and optical flow estimation model architectures on 10,000 diverse videos totaling 52 hours--an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets, yielding substantial improvements.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Nonlinear Motion-Guided and Spatio-Temporal Aware Network for Unsupervised Event-Based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05089v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras have the potential to capture continuous motion information over time and space, making them well-suited for optical flow estimation. However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

However, accurate visible and thermal (RGB-T) image registration poses a significant challenge due to the considerable modality differences. In this paper, we present a novel joint Self-Correlation and Cross-Correspondence Estimation Framework (SC3EF), leveraging both local representative features and global contextual cues to effectively generate RGB-T correspondences. For this purpose, we design a convolution-transformer-based pipeline to extract local representative features and encode global correlations of intra-modality for inter-modality correspondence estimation between unaligned visible and thermal images. After merging the local and global correspondence estimation results, we further employ a hierarchical optical flow estimation decoder to progressively refine the estimated dense correspondence maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on representative RGB-T datasets. Furthermore, it also shows competitive generalization capabilities across challenging scenarios, including large parallax, severe occlusions, adverse weather, and other cross-modal datasets (e.g., RGB-N and RGB-D).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Perturbed State Space Feature Encoders for Optical Flow with Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10669v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With their motion-responsive nature, event-based cameras offer significant advantages over traditional cameras for optical flow estimation. While deep learning has improved upon traditional methods, current neural networks adopted for event-based optical flow still face temporal and spatial reasoning limitations. We propose Perturbed State Space Feature Encoders (P-SSE) for multi-frame optical flow with event cameras to address these challenges. P-SSE adaptively processes spatiotemporal features with a large receptive field akin to Transformer-based methods, while maintaining the linear computational complexity characteristic of SSMs. However, the key innovation that enables the state-of-the-art performance of our model lies in our perturbation technique applied to the state dynamics matrix governing the SSM system. This approach significantly improves the stability and performance of our model. We integrate P-SSE into a framework that leverages bi-directional flows and recurrent connections, expanding the temporal context of flow prediction. Evaluations on DSEC-Flow and MVSEC datasets showcase P-SSE's superiority, with 8.48% and 11.86% improvements in EPE performance, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Towards Efficient Real-Time Video Motion Transfer via Generative Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05537v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a deep learning framework designed to significantly optimize bandwidth for motion-transfer-enabled video applications, including video conferencing, virtual reality interactions, health monitoring systems, and vision-based real-time anomaly detection. To capture complex motion effectively, we utilize the First Order Motion Model (FOMM), which encodes dynamic objects by detecting keypoints and their associated local affine transformations. These keypoints are identified using a self-supervised keypoint detector and arranged into a time series corresponding to the successive frames. Forecasting is performed on these keypoints by integrating two advanced generative time series models into the motion transfer pipeline, namely the Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) and the Gated Recurrent Unit with Normalizing Flow (GRU-NF). The predicted keypoints are subsequently synthesized into realistic video frames using an optical flow estimator paired with a generator network, thereby facilitating accurate video forecasting and enabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. We validate our results across three datasets for video animation and reconstruction using the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture Embedding Distance, Structural Similarity Index, and Average Pair-wise Displacement. Our results confirm that by utilizing the superior reconstruction property of the Variational Autoencoder, the VRNN integrated FOMM excels in applications involving multi-step ahead forecasts such as video conferencing. On the other hand, by leveraging the Normalizing Flow architecture for exact likelihood estimation, and enabling efficient latent space sampling, the GRU-NF based FOMM exhibits superior capabilities for producing diverse future samples while maintaining high visual quality for tasks like real-time video-based anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GG-SSMs: Graph-Generating State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12423v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs) are powerful tools for modeling sequential data in computer vision and time series analysis domains. However, traditional SSMs are limited by fixed, one-dimensional sequential processing, which restricts their ability to model non-local interactions in high-dimensional data. While methods like Mamba and VMamba introduce selective and flexible scanning strategies, they rely on predetermined paths, which fails to efficiently capture complex dependencies. We introduce Graph-Generating State Space Models (GG-SSMs), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by dynamically constructing graphs based on feature relationships. Using Chazelle's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, GG-SSMs adapt to the inherent data structure, enabling robust feature propagation across dynamically generated graphs and efficiently modeling complex dependencies. We validate GG-SSMs on 11 diverse datasets, including event-based eye-tracking, ImageNet classification, optical flow estimation, and six time series datasets. GG-SSMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, surpassing existing methods by significant margins. Specifically, GG-SSM attains a top-1 accuracy of 84.9% on ImageNet, outperforming prior SSMs by 1%, reducing the KITTI-15 error rate to 2.77%, and improving eye-tracking detection rates by up to 0.33% with fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that dynamic scanning based on feature relationships significantly improves SSMs' representational power and efficiency, offering a versatile tool for various applications in computer vision and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures, CVPR 2025 Camera Ready paper</p></details> | None |

Specifically, our work explores to provide a general representation to boost the temporal matching ability in various downstream tracking tasks. To achieve this, we firstly find that a simple extension of MAE, which randomly masks out frame patches in videos and reconstruct the frame pixels, heavily relies on spatial cues while ignoring temporal relations for frame reconstruction, thus leading to sub-optimal temporal matching representations. To alleviate this, we propose DropMAE, which adaptively performs spatial-attention dropout in the frame reconstruction to facilitate temporal correspondence learning in videos. We obtain several important findings with DropMAE: 1) DropMAE is a strong and efficient temporal matching learner, which achieves better fine-tuning results on matching-based tasks than the ImageNet-based MAE with 2x faster pre-training speed. 2) DropMAE is effective for different tracking tasks, i.e., object-level matching tasks including VOT and VOS, dense tracking tasks including optical flow estimation and tracking any point (TAP), and even 3D tracking in the different modality of point cloud data. Since none exists, we build ViT-based trackers for different downstream tracking tasks, and our pre-trained DropMAE model can be directly loaded in these ViT-based trackers for fine-tuning without further modifications. Experiments on 6 downstream tracking tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DropMAE as a general pre-trained representation for diverse tracking tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of DropMAE for 6 temporal matching-based downstream tasks</p></details> | None |

However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.</p></details> |  | None |

The quality of videos is constantly increasing, with current standards reaching 8K resolution. However, optical flow methods are usually designed for low resolution and do not generalize to large inputs due to their rigid architectures. They adopt downscaling or input tiling to reduce the input size, causing a loss of details and global information. There is also a lack of optical flow benchmarks to judge the actual performance of existing methods on high-resolution samples. Previous works only conducted qualitative high-resolution evaluations on hand-picked samples. This paper fills this gap in optical flow estimation in two ways. We propose DPFlow, an adaptive optical flow architecture capable of generalizing up to 8K resolution inputs while trained with only low-resolution samples. We also introduce Kubric-NK, a new benchmark for evaluating optical flow methods with input resolutions ranging from 1K to 8K. Our high-resolution evaluation pushes the boundaries of existing methods and reveals new insights about their generalization capabilities. Extensive experimental results show that DPFlow achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPI-Sintel, KITTI 2015, Spring, and other high-resolution benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025.

Traditional optical flow methods require consecutive frames, which are often unavailable due to limitations in data acquisition or real-world scene disruptions. Thus, single-frame optical flow estimation is emerging in the literature. However, existing single-frame approaches suffer from two major limitations: (1) they rely on labeled training data, making them task-specific, and (2) they produce deterministic predictions, failing to capture motion uncertainty. To overcome these challenges, we propose ProbDiffFlow, a training-free framework that estimates optical flow distributions from a single image. Instead of directly predicting motion, ProbDiffFlow follows an estimation-by-synthesis paradigm: it first generates diverse plausible future frames using a diffusion-based model, then estimates motion from these synthesized samples using a pre-trained optical flow model, and finally aggregates the results into a probabilistic flow distribution. This design eliminates the need for task-specific training while capturing multiple plausible motions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ProbDiffFlow achieves superior accuracy, diversity, and efficiency, outperforming existing single-image and two-frame baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

We present FG-DFPN, a novel architecture that harnesses the synergy between optical flow estimation and deformable convolutions to model complex spatio-temporal dynamics. By guiding deformable sampling with motion cues, our approach addresses the limitations of fixed-kernel networks when handling diverse motion patterns. The multi-scale design enables FG-DFPN to simultaneously capture global scene transformations and local object movements with remarkable precision. Our experiments demonstrate that FG-DFPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight diverse MPEG test sequences, outperforming existing methods by 1dB PSNR while maintaining competitive inference speeds. The integration of motion cues with adaptive geometric transformations makes FG-DFPN a promising solution for next-generation video processing systems that require high-fidelity temporal predictions.

Recent development either relies on correspondence priors for regularization or uses off-the-shelf flow estimators to derive analytical poses. However, the potential for jointly learning scene geometry, camera poses, and dense flow within a unified neural representation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Flow-NeRF, a unified framework that simultaneously optimizes scene geometry, camera poses, and dense optical flow all on-the-fly. To enable the learning of dense flow within the neural radiance field, we design and build a bijective mapping for flow estimation, conditioned on pose. To make the scene reconstruction benefit from the flow estimation, we develop an effective feature enhancement mechanism to pass canonical space features to world space representations, significantly enhancing scene geometry. We validate our model across four important tasks, i.e., novel view synthesis, depth estimation, camera pose prediction, and dense optical flow estimation, using several datasets. Our approach surpasses previous methods in almost all metrics for novel-view view synthesis and depth estimation and yields both qualitatively sound and quantitatively accurate novel-view flow.

However, the performance of SNN models is often constrained, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel neural network architecture, ST-FlowNet, specifically tailored for optical flow estimation from event-based data. The ST-FlowNet architecture integrates ConvGRU modules to facilitate cross-modal feature augmentation and temporal alignment of the predicted optical flow, improving the network's ability to capture complex motion dynamics. Additionally, to overcome the challenges associated with training SNNs, we introduce a novel approach to derive SNN models from pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) through ANN-to-SNN conversion or our proposed BISNN method. Notably, the BISNN method alleviates the complexities involved in biological parameter selection, further enhancing the robustness of SNNs in optical flow estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark event-based datasets demonstrate that the SNN-based ST-FlowNet model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior performance in accurate optical flow estimation across a diverse range of dynamic visual scenes. Furthermore, the inherent energy efficiency of SNN models is highlighted, establishing a compelling advantage for their practical deployment. Overall, our work presents a novel framework for optical flow estimation using SNNs and event-based data, contributing to the advancement of neuromorphic vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables; This work has been submitted for possible publication</p></details> | None |

However, the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanism in the Transformers results in time-consuming training and inference. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel MambaFlow framework that leverages the high accuracy and efficiency of Mamba architecture to capture features with local correlation while preserving its global information, achieving remarkable performance. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first Mamba-centric architecture for end-to-end optical flow estimation. It comprises two primary contributed components, both of which are Mamba-centric: a feature enhancement Mamba (FEM) module designed to optimize feature representation quality and a flow propagation Mamba (FPM) module engineered to address occlusion issues by facilitate effective flow information dissemination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, despite encountering occluded regions. On the Sintel benchmark, MambaFlow achieves an EPE all of 1.60, surpassing the leading 1.74 of GMFlow. Additionally, MambaFlow significantly improves inference speed with a runtime of 0.113 seconds, making it 18% faster than GMFlow.

| **[ReynoldsFlow: Exquisite Flow Estimation via Reynolds Transport Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04500v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow is a fundamental technique for motion estimation, widely applied in video stabilization, interpolation, and object tracking. Traditional optical flow estimation methods rely on restrictive assumptions like brightness constancy and slow motion constraints. Recent deep learning-based flow estimations require extensive training on large domain-specific datasets, making them computationally demanding. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) advances have enabled deep learning models to take advantage of optical flow as an important feature for object tracking and motion analysis. Since optical flow is commonly encoded in HSV for visualization, its conversion to RGB for neural network processing is nonlinear and may introduce perceptual distortions. These transformations amplify the sensitivity to estimation errors, potentially affecting the predictive accuracy of the networks. To address these challenges that are influential to the performance of downstream network models, we propose Reynolds flow, a novel training-free flow estimation inspired by the Reynolds transport theorem, offering a principled approach to modeling complex motion dynamics. In addition to conventional HSV-based visualization of Reynolds flow, we also introduce an RGB-encoded representation of Reynolds flow designed to improve flow visualization and feature enhancement for neural networks. We evaluated the effectiveness of Reynolds flow in video-based tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks, tiny object detection on UAVDB, infrared object detection on Anti-UAV, and pose estimation on GolfDB, demonstrate that networks trained with RGB-encoded Reynolds flow achieve SOTA performance, exhibiting improved robustness and efficiency across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Current advanced optical flow methods for event cameras largely adopt established image-based frameworks. However, the spatial sparsity of event data limits their performance. In this paper, we present BAT, an innovative framework that estimates event-based optical flow using bidirectional adaptive temporal correlation. BAT includes three novel designs: 1) a bidirectional temporal correlation that transforms bidirectional temporally dense motion cues into spatially dense ones, enabling accurate and spatially dense optical flow estimation; 2) an adaptive temporal sampling strategy for maintaining temporal consistency in correlation; 3) spatially adaptive temporal motion aggregation to efficiently and adaptively aggregate consistent target motion features into adjacent motion features while suppressing inconsistent ones. Our results rank $1^{st}$ on the DSEC-Flow benchmark, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while also exhibiting sharp edges and high-quality details. Notably, our BAT can accurately predict future optical flow using only past events, significantly outperforming E-RAFT's warm-start approach.

However, their memory consumption increases quadratically with input resolution, rendering them impractical for high-resolution images. In this paper, we present MeFlow, a novel memory-efficient method for high-resolution optical flow estimation. The key of MeFlow is a recurrent local orthogonal cost volume representation, which decomposes the 2D search space dynamically into two 1D orthogonal spaces, enabling our method to scale effectively to very high-resolution inputs. To preserve essential information in the orthogonal space, we utilize self attention to propagate feature information from the 2D space to the orthogonal space. We further propose a radius-distribution multi-scale lookup strategy to model the correspondences of large displacements at a negligible cost. We verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method on the challenging Sintel and KITTI benchmarks, and real-world 4K ($2160\!\times\!3840$) images. Our method achieves competitive performance on both Sintel and KITTI benchmarks, while maintaining the highest memory efficiency on high-resolution inputs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures | None |

In this paper, we explore their potential for localization within pre-existing LiDAR maps, a critical task for applications that require precise navigation and mobile manipulation. Our framework follows a paradigm based on the refinement of an initial pose. Specifically, we first project LiDAR points into 2D space based on a rough initial pose to obtain depth maps, and then employ an optical flow estimation network to align events with LiDAR points in 2D space, followed by camera pose estimation using a PnP solver. To enhance geometric consistency between these two inherently different modalities, we develop a novel frame-based event representation that improves structural clarity. Additionally, given the varying degrees of bias observed in the ground truth poses, we design a module that predicts an auxiliary variable as a regularization term to mitigate the impact of this bias on network convergence. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. To facilitate future research, both the code and the pre-trained models are made available online.</p></details> |  | None |

A single model that reasons about it should be able to solve several such tasks well. Yet, most state-of-the-art methods rely on architectures specialized for the task at hand. We present L4P (pronounced "LAP"), a feedforward, general-purpose architecture that solves low-level 4D perception tasks in a unified framework. L4P combines a ViT-based backbone with per-task heads that are lightweight and therefore do not require extensive training. Despite its general and feedforward formulation, our method matches or surpasses the performance of existing specialized methods on both dense tasks, such as depth or optical flow estimation, and sparse tasks, such as 2D/3D tracking. Moreover, it solves all those tasks at once in a time comparable to that of individual single-task methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Further we discuss data interpolation methods on unstructured grids in the context of image processing and present a pixel-based interpolation method. The efficiency of our derived adaptive finite element scheme is demonstrated on image inpainting and the task of computing the optical flow in image sequences. In particular, for optical flow estimation we derive an adaptive finite element coarse-to-fine scheme which allows resolving large displacements and speeds-up the computing time significantly.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their high cost limits their widespread adoption. On the other hand, monocular localization in LiDAR maps using inexpensive cameras is a cost-effective alternative for large-scale deployment. Nevertheless, most existing approaches struggle to generalize to new sensor setups and environments, requiring retraining or fine-tuning. In this paper, we present CMRNext, a novel approach for camera-LIDAR matching that is independent of sensor-specific parameters, generalizable, and can be used in the wild for monocular localization in LiDAR maps and camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration. CMRNext exploits recent advances in deep neural networks for matching cross-modal data and standard geometric techniques for robust pose estimation. We reformulate the point-pixel matching problem as an optical flow estimation problem and solve the Perspective-n-Point problem based on the resulting correspondences to find the relative pose between the camera and the LiDAR point cloud. We extensively evaluate CMRNext on six different robotic platforms, including three publicly available datasets and three in-house robots. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMRNext outperforms existing approaches on both tasks and effectively generalizes to previously unseen environments and sensor setups in a zero-shot manner.

In this work, we introduces an effective and robust high-dimensional (HD) feature descriptor for event frames, utilizing Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). The topological similarity among neighboring variables within VSA contributes to the enhanced representation similarity of feature descriptors for flow-matching points, while its structured symbolic representation capacity facilitates feature fusion from both event polarities and multiple spatial scales. Based on this HD feature descriptor, we propose a novel feature matching framework for event-based optical flow, encompassing both model-based (VSA-Flow) and self-supervised learning (VSA-SM) methods. In VSA-Flow, accurate optical flow estimation validates the effectiveness of HD feature descriptors. In VSA-SM, a novel similarity maximization method based on the HD feature descriptor is proposed to learn optical flow in a self-supervised way from events alone, eliminating the need for auxiliary grayscale images. Evaluation results demonstrate that our VSA-based method achieves superior accuracy in comparison to both model-based and self-supervised learning methods on the DSEC benchmark, while remains competitive among both methods on the MVSEC benchmark. This contribution marks a significant advancement in event-based optical flow within the feature matching methodology.</p></details> |  | None |

Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\% accuracy gain and a 45\% reduction in inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

Existing methods often rely on simplistic feature stacking or apply optical flow without thorough analysis. This results in suboptimal utilization of both inter-frame and intra-frame information, and it also neglects the potential of optical flow alignment under self-supervised conditions, leading to biased and insufficient denoising outcomes. To this end, we first explore the practicality of optical flow in the self-supervised setting and introduce a SpatioTemporal Blind-spot Network (STBN) for global frame feature utilization. In the temporal domain, we utilize bidirectional blind-spot feature propagation through the proposed blind-spot alignment block to ensure accurate temporal alignment and effectively capture long-range dependencies. In the spatial domain, we introduce the spatial receptive field expansion module, which enhances the receptive field and improves global perception capabilities. Additionally, to reduce the sensitivity of optical flow estimation to noise, we propose an unsupervised optical flow distillation mechanism that refines fine-grained inter-frame interactions during optical flow alignment. Our method demonstrates superior performance across both synthetic and real-world video denoising datasets.

However, current optical flow methods face challenges: learning-based approaches, often frame-based and relying on CNNs, lack cross-domain transferability, while model-based methods, though more robust, are less accurate. To address the limitations of optical flow estimation, recent works have focused on normal flow, which can be more reliably measured in regions with limited texture or strong edges. However, existing normal flow estimators are predominantly model-based and suffer from high errors. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised point-based method for normal flow estimation that overcomes the limitations of existing event learning-based approaches. Using a local point cloud encoder, our method directly estimates per-event normal flow from raw events, offering multiple unique advantages: 1) It produces temporally and spatially sharp predictions. 2) It supports more diverse data augmentation, such as random rotation, to improve robustness across various domains. 3) It naturally supports uncertainty quantification via ensemble inference, which benefits downstream tasks. 4) It enables training and inference on undistorted data in normalized camera coordinates, improving transferability across cameras. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves better and more consistent performance than state-of-the-art methods when transferred across different datasets. Leveraging this transferability, we train our model on the union of datasets and release it for public use. Finally, we introduce an egomotion solver based on a maximum-margin problem that uses normal flow and IMU to achieve strong performance in challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This makes them well-suited for sequential tasks like processing event-based data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and event-based speech tasks. Harnessing the temporal capabilities of SNNs requires mitigating vanishing spikes during training, capturing spatio-temporal patterns and enhancing precise spike timing. To address these challenges, we propose TSkips, augmenting SNN architectures with forward and backward skip connections that incorporate explicit temporal delays. These connections capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies and facilitate better spike flow over long sequences. The introduction of TSkips creates a vast search space of possible configurations, encompassing skip positions and time delay values. To efficiently navigate this search space, this work leverages training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal network structures and corresponding delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four event-based datasets: DSEC-flow for optical flow estimation, DVS128 Gesture for hand gesture recognition and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) for speech recognition. Our method achieves significant improvements across these datasets: up to 18% reduction in Average Endpoint Error (AEE) on DSEC-flow, 8% increase in classification accuracy on DVS128 Gesture, and up to 8% and 16% higher classification accuracy on SHD and SSC, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, the robustness of these methods has been infrequently investigated. Despite some research focusing on the robustness of optical flow models against adversarial attacks, there has been a lack of studies investigating their robustness to common corruptions. Taking into account the unique temporal characteristics of optical flow, we introduce 7 temporal corruptions specifically designed for benchmarking the robustness of optical flow models, in addition to 17 classical single-image corruptions, in which advanced PSF Blur simulation method is performed. Two robustness benchmarks, KITTI-FC and GoPro-FC, are subsequently established as the first corruption robustness benchmark for optical flow estimation, with Out-Of-Domain (OOD) and In-Domain (ID) settings to facilitate comprehensive studies. Robustness metrics, Corruption Robustness Error (CRE), Corruption Robustness Error ratio (CREr), and Relative Corruption Robustness Error (RCRE) are further introduced to quantify the optical flow estimation robustness. 29 model variants from 15 optical flow methods are evaluated, yielding 10 intriguing observations, such as 1) the absolute robustness of the model is heavily dependent on the estimation performance; 2) the corruptions that diminish local information are more serious than that reduce visual effects. We also give suggestions for the design and application of optical flow models. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as a foundational resource for advancing research in robust optical flow estimation.

However, existing works only focus event data within the confines of task-specific domains, overlooking how tasks across the temporal and spatial domains can reinforce each other. In this paper, we reformulate event-based flow estimation and stereo matching as a unified dense correspondence matching problem, enabling us to solve both tasks within a single model by directly matching features in a shared representation space. Specifically, our method utilizes a Temporal Recurrent Network to aggregate event features across temporal or spatial domains, and a Spatial Contextual Attention to enhance knowledge transfer across event flows via temporal or spatial interactions. By utilizing a shared feature similarities module that integrates knowledge from event streams via temporal or spatial interactions, our network performs optical flow estimation from temporal event segment inputs and stereo matching from spatial event segment inputs simultaneously. We demonstrate that our unified model inherently supports multi-task fusion and cross-task transfer. Without the need for retraining for specific task, our model can effectively handle both optical flow and stereo estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

These patterns vary in color, shape, and location across video frames, posing challenges in extracting information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency throughout the restoration process. Existing deep learning methods often depend on well-designed alignment modules, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, incurring high computational costs. Recent studies indicate that utilizing raw data as input can significantly improve the effectiveness of video demoireing by providing the pristine degradation information and more detailed content. However, previous works fail to design both efficient and effective raw video demoireing methods that can maintain temporal consistency and prevent degradation of color and spatial details. This paper introduces a novel alignment-free raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). It features sequentially arranged Spatial Mamba Blocks (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to effectively model the inter- and intra-relationships in raw videos affected by moire patterns. An Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) within the SMB facilitates demoireing in the frequency domain, while a Channel Attention Block (CAB) in the TMB enhances the temporal information interactions by leveraging inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.3 dB in PSNR, and also provides a satisfactory visual experience.</p></details> |  | None |

Most methods tacking this problem rely on providing user-defined controls, such as binary masks or camera movement embeddings. In our approach we propose OnlyFlow, an approach leveraging the optical flow firstly extracted from an input video to condition the motion of generated videos. Using a text prompt and an input video, OnlyFlow allows the user to generate videos that respect the motion of the input video as well as the text prompt. This is implemented through an optical flow estimation model applied on the input video, which is then fed to a trainable optical flow encoder. The output feature maps are then injected into the text-to-video backbone model. We perform quantitative, qualitative and user preference studies to show that OnlyFlow positively compares to state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of tasks, even though OnlyFlow was not specifically trained for such tasks. OnlyFlow thus constitutes a versatile, lightweight yet efficient method for controlling motion in text-to-video generation.

In this work, we present a novel method, dubbed HMAFlow, to improve optical flow estimation in challenging scenes, particularly those involving small objects. The proposed model mainly consists of two core components: a Hierarchical Motion Field Alignment (HMA) module and a Correlation Self-Attention (CSA) module. In addition, we rebuild 4D cost volumes by employing a Multi-Scale Correlation Search (MCS) layer and replacing average pooling in common cost volumes with a search strategy utilizing multiple search ranges.

However, training of SNNs poses significant challenges due to the necessity for precise temporal and spatial credit assignment. Back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, whilst the most widely used method for addressing these issues, incurs high computational cost due to its temporal dependency. In this work, we propose S-TLLR, a novel three-factor temporal local learning rule inspired by the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) mechanism, aimed at training deep SNNs on event-based learning tasks. Furthermore, S-TLLR is designed to have low memory and time complexities, which are independent of the number of time steps, rendering it suitable for online learning on low-power edge devices. To demonstrate the scalability of our proposed method, we have conducted extensive evaluations on event-based datasets spanning a wide range of applications, such as image and gesture recognition, audio classification, and optical flow estimation. In all the experiments, S-TLLR achieved high accuracy, comparable to BPTT, with a reduction in memory between $5-50\times$ and multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations between $1.3-6.6\times$.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures | None |

While data-driven optical flow estimation has obtained great success in RGB cameras, its generalization performance is seriously hindered in event cameras mainly due to the limited and biased training data. In this paper, we present a novel simulator, BlinkSim, for the fast generation of large-scale data for event-based optical flow. BlinkSim incorporates a configurable rendering engine alongside an event simulation suite. By leveraging the wealth of current 3D assets, the rendering engine enables us to automatically build up thousands of scenes with different objects, textures, and motion patterns and render very high-frequency images for realistic event data simulation. Based on BlinkSim, we construct a large training dataset and evaluation benchmark BlinkFlow that contains sufficient, diversiform, and challenging event data with optical flow ground truth. Experiments show that BlinkFlow improves the generalization performance of state-of-the-art methods by more than 40\% on average and up to 90\%. Moreover, we further propose an Event-based optical Flow transFormer (E-FlowFormer) architecture. Powered by our BlinkFlow, E-FlowFormer outperforms the SOTA methods by up to 91\% on the MVSEC dataset and 14\% on the DSEC dataset and presents the best generalization performance.

Due to the event-triggering mechanism, such cameras record event streams with much shorter response latency and higher intensity sensitivity compared to conventional cameras. On the basis of these features, previous works have attempted to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) videos from events, but have either suffered from unrealistic artifacts or failed to provide sufficiently high frame rates. In this paper, we present a recurrent convolutional neural network that reconstruct high-speed HDR videos from event sequences, with a key frame guidance to prevent potential error accumulation caused by the sparse event data. Additionally, to address the problem of severely limited real dataset, we develop a new optical system to collect a real-world dataset with paired high-speed HDR videos and event streams, facilitating future research in this field. Our dataset provides the first real paired dataset for event-to-HDR reconstruction, avoiding potential inaccuracies from simulation strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality, high-speed HDR videos. We further explore the potential of our work in cross-camera reconstruction and downstream computer vision tasks, including object detection, panoramic segmentation, optical flow estimation, and monocular depth estimation under HDR scenarios.</p></details> | TPAMI 2024 | None |
| **[TempBEV: Improving Learned BEV Encoders with Combined Image and BEV Space Temporal Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11803v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment. A strategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual sensors into one joint latent space. For cost-efficient camera-only systems, this provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with different views. Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor information over time. This is especially important in monocular camera systems to account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements. Thereby, the effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators used to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation spaces. We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their effectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent representations. While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information either in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance comparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary strengths. Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which integrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces. We consider subsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from optical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding. Empirical evaluation on the NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the baseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation. The ablation uncovers a strong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space. These results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a strong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> | None |

The nature of videos exhibits redundant temporal cues for rain removal with higher stability. Traditional video deraining methods heavily rely on optical flow estimation and kernel-based manners, which have a limited receptive field. Yet, transformer architectures, while enabling long-term dependencies, bring about a significant increase in computational complexity. Recently, the linear-complexity operator of the state space models (SSMs) has contrarily facilitated efficient long-term temporal modeling, which is crucial for rain streaks and raindrops removal in videos. Unexpectedly, its uni-dimensional sequential process on videos destroys the local correlations across the spatio-temporal dimension by distancing adjacent pixels. To address this, we present an improved SSMs-based video deraining network (RainMamba) with a novel Hilbert scanning mechanism to better capture sequence-level local information. We also introduce a difference-guided dynamic contrastive locality learning strategy to enhance the patch-level self-similarity learning ability of the proposed network. Extensive experiments on four synthesized video deraining datasets and real-world rainy videos demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our network in the removal of rain streaks and raindrops.

However, the scarcity of datasets and a modern baseline hinders the progress in facial optical flow research. This paper proposes FacialFlowNet (FFN), a novel large-scale facial optical flow dataset, and the Decomposed Facial Flow Model (DecFlow), the first method capable of decomposing facial flow. FFN comprises 9,635 identities and 105,970 image pairs, offering unprecedented diversity for detailed facial and head motion analysis. DecFlow features a facial semantic-aware encoder and a decomposed flow decoder, excelling in accurately estimating and decomposing facial flow into head and expression components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FFN significantly enhances the accuracy of facial flow estimation across various optical flow methods, achieving up to an 11% reduction in Endpoint Error (EPE) (from 3.91 to 3.48). Moreover, DecFlow, when coupled with FFN, outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, enhancing facial expression analysis. The decomposed expression flow achieves a substantial accuracy improvement of 18% (from 69.1% to 82.1%) in micro-expressions recognition. These contributions represent a significant advancement in facial motion analysis and optical flow estimation. Codes and datasets can be found.</p></details> | ACMMM2024 | None |

State-of-the-art cameras provide this required high frame-rate and high spatial resolution together, albeit at a high cost. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a dual camera system for the generation of HSTR video using reference-based super-resolution (RefSR). One camera captures high spatial resolution low frame rate (HSLF) video while the other captures low spatial resolution high frame rate (LSHF) video simultaneously for the same scene. A novel deep learning architecture is proposed to fuse HSLF and LSHF video feeds and synthesize HSTR video frames. The proposed model combines optical flow estimation and (channel-wise and spatial) attention mechanisms to capture the fine motion and complex dependencies between frames of the two video feeds. Simulations show that the proposed model provides significant improvement over existing reference-based SR techniques in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics. The method also exhibits sufficient frames per second (FPS) for aerial monitoring when deployed on a power-constrained drone equipped with dual cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

They offer significant advantages over conventional frame-based cameras, such as a higher dynamic range and an extremely faster data rate, making them particularly useful in scenarios involving fast motion or challenging lighting conditions. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) share similar asynchronous and sparse characteristics and are well-suited for processing data from event cameras. Inspired by the potential of transformers and spike-driven transformers (spikeformers) in other computer vision tasks, we propose two solutions for fast and robust optical flow estimation for event cameras: STTFlowNet and SDformerFlow. STTFlowNet adopts a U-shaped artificial neural network (ANN) architecture with spatiotemporal shifted window self-attention (swin) transformer encoders, while SDformerFlow presents its fully spiking counterpart, incorporating swin spikeformer encoders. Furthermore, we present two variants of the spiking version with different neuron models. Our work is the first to make use of spikeformers for dense optical flow estimation. We conduct end-to-end training for all models using supervised learning. Our results yield state-of-the-art performance among SNN-based event optical flow methods on both the DSEC and MVSEC datasets, and show significant reduction in power consumption compared to the equivalent ANNs.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

It is very challenging due to the high dimensionality of the data and the temporal consistency required for obtaining convincing results. Recently, diffusion models have shown impressive results in modeling complex data distributions, including images and videos. Such models remain nonetheless very expensive to train and to perform inference with, which strongly reduce their applicability to videos, and yields unreasonable computational loads. We show that in the case of video inpainting, thanks to the highly auto-similar nature of videos, the training data of a diffusion model can be restricted to the input video and still produce very satisfying results. This leads us to adopt an internal learning approach, which also allows us to greatly reduce the neural network size by about three orders of magnitude less than current diffusion models used for image inpainting. We also introduce a new method for efficient training and inference of diffusion models in the context of internal learning, by splitting the diffusion process into different learning intervals corresponding to different noise levels of the diffusion process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first video inpainting method based purely on diffusion. Other methods require additional components such as optical flow estimation, which limits their performance in the case of dynamic textures and complex motions. We show qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating that our method reaches state of the art performance in the case of dynamic textures and complex dynamic backgrounds.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, most existing methods focus on the network training under weak supervision, while efficient annotation strategies remain largely unexplored. To tackle this gap, we implement LiDAR semantic segmentation using scatter image annotation, effectively integrating an efficient annotation strategy with network training. Specifically, we propose employing scatter images to annotate LiDAR point clouds, combining a pre-trained optical flow estimation network with a foundation image segmentation model to rapidly propagate manual annotations into dense labels for both images and point clouds. Moreover, we propose ScatterNet, a network that includes three pivotal strategies to reduce the performance gap caused by such annotations. Firstly, it utilizes dense semantic labels as supervision for the image branch, alleviating the modality imbalance between point clouds and images. Secondly, an intermediate fusion branch is proposed to obtain multimodal texture and structural features. Lastly, a perception consistency loss is introduced to determine which information needs to be fused and which needs to be discarded during the fusion process. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets have demonstrated that our method requires less than 0.02% of the labeled points to achieve over 95% of the performance of fully-supervised methods. Notably, our labeled points are only 5% of those used in the most advanced weakly supervised methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous approaches have depended on supervised learning on synthetic data, which lacks interpretability and risk over-fitting to the setting of the event simulator. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) based methods, which primarily utilize per-frame optical flow to estimate intensity via photometric constancy, has been actively investigated. However, they are vulnerable to errors in the case of inaccurate optical flow. This paper proposes a novel SSL event-to-video reconstruction approach, dubbed EvINR, which eliminates the need for labeled data or optical flow estimation. Our core idea is to reconstruct intensity frames by directly addressing the event generation model, essentially a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how events are generated based on the time-varying brightness signals. Specifically, we utilize an implicit neural representation (INR), which takes in spatiotemporal coordinate $(x, y, t)$ and predicts intensity values, to represent the solution of the event generation equation. The INR, parameterized as a fully-connected Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), can be optimized with its temporal derivatives supervised by events. To make EvINR feasible for online requisites, we propose several acceleration techniques that substantially expedite the training process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our EvINR surpasses previous SSL methods by 38% w.r.t. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and is comparable or superior to SoTA supervised methods.

Adversarial attacks such as the seminal projected gradient descent (PGD) offer an effective means to evaluate a model's robustness and dedicated solutions have been proposed for attacks on semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation. While they attempt to increase the attack's efficiency, a further objective is to balance its effect, so that it acts on the entire image domain instead of isolated point-wise predictions. This often comes at the cost of optimization stability and thus efficiency. Here, we propose CosPGD, an attack that encourages more balanced errors over the entire image domain while increasing the attack's overall efficiency. To this end, CosPGD leverages a simple alignment score computed from any pixel-wise prediction and its target to scale the loss in a smooth and fully differentiable way. It leads to efficient evaluations of a model's robustness for semantic segmentation as well as regression models (such as optical flow, disparity estimation, or image restoration), and it allows it to outperform the previous SotA attack on semantic segmentation.

However, existing methods lack attention to local details, such as facial state changes between video frames, which can reduce the discriminability of features and thus lower recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Detail-Enhanced Intra- and Inter-modal Interaction network(DE-III) for AVER, incorporating several novel aspects. We introduce optical flow information to enrich video representations with texture details that better capture facial state changes. A fusion module integrates the optical flow estimation with the corresponding video frames to enhance the representation of facial texture variations. We also design attentive intra- and inter-modal feature enhancement modules to further improve the richness and discriminability of video and audio representations. A detailed quantitative evaluation shows that our proposed model outperforms all existing methods on three benchmark datasets for both concrete and continuous emotion recognition. To encourage further research and ensure replicability, we will release our full code upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 27th International Conference of Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2024)</p></details> | None |

Although certain applications are security-critical or bear societal significance, the adversarial robustness of such models are not sufficiently studied, especially in the black-box scenario. In this work, we introduce the first unified black-box adversarial patch attack framework against pixel-wise regression tasks, aiming to identify the vulnerabilities of these models under query-based black-box attacks. We propose a novel square-based adversarial patch optimization framework and employ probabilistic square sampling and score-based gradient estimation techniques to generate the patch effectively and efficiently, overcoming the scalability problem of previous black-box patch attacks. Our attack prototype, named BadPart, is evaluated on both MDE and OFE tasks, utilizing a total of 7 models. BadPart surpasses 3 baseline methods in terms of both attack performance and efficiency. We also apply BadPart on the Google online service for portrait depth estimation, causing 43.5% relative distance error with 50K queries. State-of-the-art (SOTA) countermeasures cannot defend our attack effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Rethink Predicting the Optical Flow with the Kinetics Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12512v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation is one of the fundamental tasks in low-level computer vision, which describes the pixel-wise displacement and can be used in many other tasks. From the apparent aspect, the optical flow can be viewed as the correlation between the pixels in consecutive frames, so continuously refining the correlation volume can achieve an outstanding performance. However, it will make the method have a catastrophic computational complexity. Not only that, the error caused by the occlusion regions of the successive frames will be amplified through the inaccurate warp operation. These challenges can not be solved only from the apparent view, so this paper rethinks the optical flow estimation from the kinetics viewpoint.We propose a method combining the apparent and kinetics information from this motivation. The proposed method directly predicts the optical flow from the feature extracted from images instead of building the correlation volume, which will improve the efficiency of the whole network. Meanwhile, the proposed method involves a new differentiable warp operation that simultaneously considers the warping and occlusion. Moreover, the proposed method blends the kinetics feature with the apparent feature through the novel self-supervised loss function. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies prove that the proposed novel insight into how to predict the optical flow can achieve the better performance of the state-of-the-art methods, and in some metrics, the proposed method outperforms the correlation-based method, especially in situations containing occlusion and fast moving. The code will be public.</p></details> |  | None |

Namely, we focus on integrating scene global motion knowledge to improve large-scale semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation. Prior works on VOS mostly rely on direct comparison of semantic and contextual features to perform dense matching between current and past frames, passing over actual motion structure. On the other hand, Optical Flow Estimation task aims to approximate the scene motion field, exposing global motion patterns which are typically undiscoverable during all pairs similarity search. We present WarpFormer, an architecture for semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation that exploits existing knowledge in motion understanding to conduct smoother propagation and more accurate matching. Our framework employs a generic pretrained Optical Flow Estimation network whose prediction is used to warp both past frames and instance segmentation masks to the current frame domain. Consequently, warped segmentation masks are refined and fused together aiming to inpaint occluded regions and eliminate artifacts caused by flow field imperfects. Additionally, we employ novel large-scale MOSE 2023 dataset to train model on various complex scenarios. Our method demonstrates strong performance on DAVIS 2016/2017 validation (93.0% and 85.9%), DAVIS 2017 test-dev (80.6%) and YouTube-VOS 2019 validation (83.8%) that is competitive with alternative state-of-the-art methods while using much simpler memory mechanism and instance understanding logic.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we address these challenges at the task level by introducing Amodal Optical Flow, which integrates optical flow with amodal perception. Instead of only representing the visible regions, we define amodal optical flow as a multi-layered pixel-level motion field that encompasses both visible and occluded regions of the scene. To facilitate research on this new task, we extend the AmodalSynthDrive dataset to include pixel-level labels for amodal optical flow estimation. We present several strong baselines, along with the Amodal Flow Quality metric to quantify the performance in an interpretable manner. Furthermore, we propose the novel AmodalFlowNet as an initial step toward addressing this task. AmodalFlowNet consists of a transformer-based cost-volume encoder paired with a recurrent transformer decoder which facilitates recurrent hierarchical feature propagation and amodal semantic grounding. We demonstrate the tractability of amodal optical flow in extensive experiments and show its utility for downstream tasks such as panoptic tracking.

Moreover, correlation volumes scale poorly with resolution, prohibiting them from estimating high-resolution flow. We observe that the spatiotemporally continuous traces of events provide a natural search direction for seeking pixel correspondences, obviating the need to rely on gradients of explicit correlation volumes as such search directions. We introduce IDNet (Iterative Deblurring Network), a lightweight yet high-performing event-based optical flow network directly estimating flow from event traces without using correlation volumes. We further propose two iterative update schemes: "ID" which iterates over the same batch of events, and "TID" which iterates over time with streaming events in an online fashion. Our top-performing ID model sets a new state of the art on DSEC benchmark. Meanwhile, the base ID model is competitive with prior arts while using 80% fewer parameters, consuming 20x less memory footprint and running 40% faster on the NVidia Jetson Xavier NX. Furthermore, the TID model is even more efficient offering an additional 5x faster inference speed and 8 ms ultra-low latency at the cost of only a 9% performance drop, making it the only model among current literature capable of real-time operation while maintaining decent performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA'24), Yokohama, Japan, May 13-17, 2024. arXiv revision includes additional ablation studies results</p></details> | None |

Despite substantial recent advancements, achieving real-time on-device optical flow estimation remains a complex challenge. First, an optical flow model must be sufficiently lightweight to meet computation and memory constraints to ensure real-time performance on devices. Second, the necessity for real-time on-device operation imposes constraints that weaken the model's capacity to adequately handle ambiguities in flow estimation, thereby intensifying the difficulty of preserving flow accuracy. This paper introduces two synergistic techniques, Self-Cleaning Iteration (SCI) and Regression Focal Loss (RFL), designed to enhance the capabilities of optical flow models, with a focus on addressing optical flow regression ambiguities. These techniques prove particularly effective in mitigating error propagation, a prevalent issue in optical flow models that employ iterative refinement. Notably, these techniques add negligible to zero overhead in model parameters and inference latency, thereby preserving real-time on-device efficiency. The effectiveness of our proposed SCI and RFL techniques, collectively referred to as SciFlow for brevity, is demonstrated across two distinct lightweight optical flow model architectures in our experiments. Remarkably, SciFlow enables substantial reduction in error metrics (EPE and Fl-all) over the baseline models by up to 6.3% and 10.5% for in-domain scenarios and by up to 6.2% and 13.5% for cross-domain scenarios on the Sintel and KITTI 2015 datasets, respectively.</p></details> | CVPRW 2024 | None |

Classical optical flow estimation uses two frames as input, whilst some recent methods consider multiple frames to explicitly model long-range information. The former ones limit their ability to fully leverage temporal coherence along the video sequence; and the latter ones incur heavy computational overhead, typically not possible for real-time flow estimation. Some multi-frame-based approaches even necessitate unseen future frames for current estimation, compromising real-time applicability in safety-critical scenarios. To this end, we present MemFlow, a real-time method for optical flow estimation and prediction with memory. Our method enables memory read-out and update modules for aggregating historical motion information in real-time. Furthermore, we integrate resolution-adaptive re-scaling to accommodate diverse video resolutions. Besides, our approach seamlessly extends to the future prediction of optical flow based on past observations. Leveraging effective historical motion aggregation, our method outperforms VideoFlow with fewer parameters and faster inference speed on Sintel and KITTI-15 datasets in terms of generalization performance. At the time of submission, MemFlow also leads in performance on the 1080p Spring dataset.

Such self-supervised methods require high-quality salient features and consequently suffer from severe performance drop for indoor scenes, where low-textured regions dominant in the scenes are almost indiscriminative. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised indoor monocular depth estimation framework called $\mathrm{F^2Depth}$. A self-supervised optical flow estimation network is introduced to supervise depth learning. To improve optical flow estimation performance in low-textured areas, only some patches of points with more discriminative features are adopted for finetuning based on our well-designed patch-based photometric loss. The finetuned optical flow estimation network generates high-accuracy optical flow as a supervisory signal for depth estimation. Correspondingly, an optical flow consistency loss is designed. Multi-scale feature maps produced by finetuned optical flow estimation network perform warping to compute feature map synthesis loss as another supervisory signal for depth learning. Experimental results on the NYU Depth V2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and our proposed losses. To evaluate the generalization ability of our $\mathrm{F^2Depth}$, we collect a Campus Indoor depth dataset composed of approximately 1500 points selected from 99 images in 18 scenes. Zero-shot generalization experiments on 7-Scenes dataset and Campus Indoor achieve $\delta_1$ accuracy of 75.8% and 76.0% respectively. The accuracy results show that our model can generalize well to monocular images captured in unknown indoor scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

While current methods rely on data augmentation, they have yet to fully exploit the rich information available in labeled video sequences. We propose OCAI, a method that supports robust frame interpolation by generating intermediate video frames alongside optical flows in between. Utilizing a forward warping approach, OCAI employs occlusion awareness to resolve ambiguities in pixel values and fills in missing values by leveraging the forward-backward consistency of optical flows. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student style semi-supervised learning method on top of the interpolated frames. Using a pair of unlabeled frames and the teacher model's predicted optical flow, we generate interpolated frames and flows to train a student model. The teacher's weights are maintained using Exponential Moving Averaging of the student. Our evaluations demonstrate perceptually superior interpolation quality and enhanced optical flow accuracy on established benchmarks such as Sintel and KITTI.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 | None |

Prior methods often employ high-level architectural priors, separating static and dynamic elements, resulting in suboptimal capture of their synergistic interactions. To address this challenge, we present a unified representation model, called Periodic Vibration Gaussian (PVG). PVG builds upon the efficient 3D Gaussian splatting technique, originally designed for static scene representation, by introducing periodic vibration-based temporal dynamics. This innovation enables PVG to elegantly and uniformly represent the characteristics of various objects and elements in dynamic urban scenes. To enhance temporally coherent and large scene representation learning with sparse training data, we introduce a novel temporal smoothing mechanism and a position-aware adaptive control strategy respectively. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that PVG surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis for both dynamic and static scenes. Notably, PVG achieves this without relying on manually labeled object bounding boxes or expensive optical flow estimation. Moreover, PVG exhibits 900-fold acceleration in rendering over the best alternative.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fudan-zvg.github.io/PVG/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://fudan-zvg.github.io/PVG) |
| **[Best of Both Worlds: Hybrid SNN-ANN Architecture for Event-based Optical Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02960v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of robotics, event-based cameras are emerging as a promising low-power alternative to traditional frame-based cameras for capturing high-speed motion and high dynamic range scenes. This is due to their sparse and asynchronous event outputs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their asynchronous event-driven compute, show great potential for extracting the spatio-temporal features from these event streams. In contrast, the standard Analog Neural Networks (ANNs) fail to process event data effectively. However, training SNNs is difficult due to additional trainable parameters (thresholds and leaks), vanishing spikes at deeper layers, and a non-differentiable binary activation function. Furthermore, an additional data structure, membrane potential, responsible for keeping track of temporal information, must be fetched and updated at every timestep in SNNs. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel SNN-ANN hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of both. Specifically, we leverage the asynchronous compute capabilities of SNN layers to effectively extract the input temporal information. Concurrently, the ANN layers facilitate training and efficient hardware deployment on traditional machine learning hardware such as GPUs. We provide extensive experimental analysis for assigning each layer to be spiking or analog, leading to a network configuration optimized for performance and ease of training. We evaluate our hybrid architecture for optical flow estimation on DSEC-flow and Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event-Camera (MVSEC) datasets. On the DSEC-flow dataset, the hybrid SNN-ANN architecture achieves a 40% reduction in average endpoint error (AEE) with 22% lower energy consumption compared to Full-SNN, and 48% lower AEE compared to Full-ANN, while maintaining comparable energy usage.</p></details> |  | None |

To model complex motion, we use the First Order Motion Model (FOMM) that represents dynamic objects using learned keypoints along with their local affine transformations. Keypoints are extracted by a self-supervised keypoint detector and organized in a time series corresponding to the video frames. Prediction of keypoints, to enable transmission using lower frames per second on the source device, is performed using a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN). The predicted keypoints are then synthesized to video frames using an optical flow estimator and a generator network. This efficacy of leveraging keypoint based representations in conjunction with VRNN based prediction for both video animation and reconstruction is demonstrated on three diverse datasets. For real-time applications, our results show the effectiveness of our proposed architecture by enabling up to 2x additional bandwidth reduction over existing keypoint based video motion transfer frameworks without significantly compromising video quality.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent learning-based optical flow methods have achieved high accuracy, they often come with heavy computation costs. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient optical flow architecture, called NeuFlow, that addresses both high accuracy and computational cost concerns. The architecture follows a global-to-local scheme. Given the features of the input images extracted at different spatial resolutions, global matching is employed to estimate an initial optical flow on the 1/16 resolution, capturing large displacement, which is then refined on the 1/8 resolution with lightweight CNN layers for better accuracy. We evaluate our approach on Jetson Orin Nano and RTX 2080 to demonstrate efficiency improvements across different computing platforms. We achieve a notable 10x-80x speedup compared to several state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach achieves around 30 FPS on edge computing platforms, which represents a significant breakthrough in deploying complex computer vision tasks such as SLAM on small robots like drones.

Due to the specific requirements of different tasks like optical flow estimation and local feature matching, previous works are primarily categorized into dense matching and sparse feature matching focusing on specialized architectures along with task-specific datasets, which may somewhat hinder the generalization performance of specialized models. In this paper, we propose a deep model for sparse and dense matching, termed RGM (Robust Generalist Matching). In particular, we elaborately design a cascaded GRU module for refinement by exploring the geometric similarity iteratively at multiple scales following an additional uncertainty estimation module for sparsification. To narrow the gap between synthetic training samples and real-world scenarios, we build a new, large-scale dataset with sparse correspondence ground truth by generating optical flow supervision with greater intervals. As such, we are able to mix up various dense and sparse matching datasets, significantly improving the training diversity. The generalization capacity of our proposed RGM is greatly improved by learning the matching and uncertainty estimation in a two-stage manner on the large, mixed data.

However, previous learned approaches often directly extend neural P-frame codecs to B-frame relying on bi-directional optical-flow estimation or video frame interpolation. They suffer from inaccurate quantized motions and inefficient motion compensation. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective structure called Interpolation-driven B-frame Video Compression (IBVC). Our approach only involves two major operations: video frame interpolation and artifact reduction compression. IBVC introduces a bit-rate free MEMC based on interpolation, which avoids optical-flow quantization and additional compression distortions. Later, to reduce duplicate bit-rate consumption and focus on unaligned artifacts, a residual guided masking encoder is deployed to adaptively select the meaningful contexts with interpolated multi-scale dependencies. In addition, a conditional spatio-temporal decoder is proposed to eliminate location errors and artifacts instead of using MEMC coding in other methods. The experimental results on B-frame coding demonstrate that IBVC has significant improvements compared to the relevant state-of-the-art methods.

While their operational principle ensures event streams are spatially sparse, the high temporal resolution of the sensors can result in high data rates from the sensor depending on scene dynamics. For systems operating in communication-bandwidth-constrained and power-constrained environments, it is essential to compress these streams before transmitting them to a remote receiver. Therefore, we introduce a flow-based method for the real-time asynchronous compression of event streams as they are generated. This method leverages real-time optical flow estimates to predict future events without needing to transmit them, therefore, drastically reducing the amount of data transmitted. The flow-based compression introduced is evaluated using a variety of methods including spatiotemporal distance between event streams. The introduced method itself is shown to achieve an average compression ratio of 2.81 on a variety of event-camera datasets with the evaluation configuration used. That compression is achieved with a median temporal error of 0.48 ms and an average spatiotemporal event-stream distance of 3.07. When combined with LZMA compression for non-real-time applications, our method can achieve state-of-the-art average compression ratios ranging from 10.45 to 17.24.

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method to jointly learn 3D motion and depth from monocular videos. Our system contains a depth estimation module to predict depth, and a new decomposed object-wise 3D motion (DO3D) estimation module to predict ego-motion and 3D object motion. Depth and motion networks work collaboratively to faithfully model the geometry and dynamics of real-world scenes, which, in turn, benefits both depth and 3D motion estimation. Their predictions are further combined to synthesize a novel video frame for self-supervised training. As a core component of our framework, DO3D is a new motion disentanglement module that learns to predict camera ego-motion and instance-aware 3D object motion separately. To alleviate the difficulties in estimating non-rigid 3D object motions, they are decomposed to object-wise 6-DoF global transformations and a pixel-wise local 3D motion deformation field. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, including KITTI, Cityscapes, and VKITTI2, where our model delivers superior performance in all evaluated settings. For the depth estimation task, our model outperforms all compared research works in the high-resolution setting, attaining an absolute relative depth error (abs rel) of 0.099 on the KITTI benchmark. Besides, our optical flow estimation results (an overall EPE of 7.09 on KITTI) also surpass state-of-the-art methods and largely improve the estimation of dynamic regions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our motion model.

They are, however, too slow in practice to track every point observed in a single frame in a reasonable amount of time. This paper introduces DOT, a novel, simple and efficient method for solving this problem. It first extracts a small set of tracks from key regions at motion boundaries using an off-the-shelf point tracking algorithm. Given source and target frames, DOT then computes rough initial estimates of a dense flow field and visibility mask through nearest-neighbor interpolation, before refining them using a learnable optical flow estimator that explicitly handles occlusions and can be trained on synthetic data with ground-truth correspondences. We show that DOT is significantly more accurate than current optical flow techniques, outperforms sophisticated "universal" trackers like OmniMotion, and is on par with, or better than, the best point tracking algorithms like CoTracker while being at least two orders of magnitude faster. Quantitative and qualitative experiments with synthetic and real videos validate the promise of the proposed approach.

Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) approaches take noisy motion estimation as input or model motion implicitly, restricting detection performance in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel Explicit Motion handling and Interactive Prompting framework for VCOD, dubbed EMIP, which handles motion cues explicitly using a frozen pre-trained optical flow fundamental model. EMIP is characterized by a two-stream architecture for simultaneously conducting camouflaged segmentation and optical flow estimation. Interactions across the dual streams are realized in an interactive prompting way that is inspired by emerging visual prompt learning. Two learnable modules, i.e. the camouflaged feeder and motion collector, are designed to incorporate segmentation-to-motion and motion-to-segmentation prompts, respectively, and enhance outputs of the both streams. The prompt fed to the motion stream is learned by supervising optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we show that long-term historical information can also be incorporated as a prompt into EMIP and achieve more robust results with temporal consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our EMIP achieves new state-of-the-art records on popular VCOD benchmarks. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

Despite the recent significant progress brought about by deep learning, most existing deep learning OFE methods still struggle to handle occlusions; in particular, those based on two frames cannot correctly handle occlusions because occluded regions have no visual correspondences. However, there is still hope in multi-frame settings, which can potentially mitigate the occlusion issue in OFE. Unfortunately, multi-frame OFE (MOFE) remains underexplored, and the limited studies on it are mainly specially designed for pyramid backbones or else obtain the aligned previous frame's features, such as correlation volume and optical flow, through time-consuming backward flow calculation or non-differentiable forward warping transformation. This study proposes an efficient MOFE framework named SplatFlow to address these shortcomings. SplatFlow introduces the differentiable splatting transformation to align the previous frame's motion feature and designs a Final-to-All embedding method to input the aligned motion feature into the current frame's estimation, thus remodeling the existing two-frame backbones. The proposed SplatFlow is efficient yet more accurate, as it can handle occlusions properly. Extensive experimental evaluations show that SplatFlow substantially outperforms all published methods on the KITTI2015 and Sintel benchmarks. Especially on the Sintel benchmark, SplatFlow achieves errors of 1.12 (clean pass) and 2.07 (final pass), with surprisingly significant 19.4% and 16.2% error reductions, respectively, from the previous best results submitted. The code for SplatFlow is available at https://github.com/wwsource/SplatFlow.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/wwsource/SplatFlow) |

Detecting these currents currently relies on costly equipment and is challenging to implement on a larger scale. The advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and camera technology, however, has made monitoring near-shore regions more accessible and scalable. This paper proposes a new framework for detecting rip currents using video-based methods that leverage optical flow estimation, offshore direction calculation, earth camera projection with almost local-isometric embedding on the sphere, and temporal data fusion techniques. Through the analysis of videos from multiple beaches, including Palm Beach, Haulover, Ocean Reef Park, and South Beach, as well as YouTube footage, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, which aligns with human experts' annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Traditional numerical simulation systems depend largely on the initial settings and correctness of the constructed partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite recent efforts yielding significant success in discovering data-driven PDEs with neural networks, the limitations posed by singular scenarios and the absence of local insights prevent them from performing effectively in a broader real-world context. To this end, this paper propose the universal expert module -- that is, optical flow estimation component, to capture the evolution laws of general physical processes in a data-driven fashion. To enhance local insight, we painstakingly design a finer-grained physical pipeline, since local characteristics may be influenced by various internal contextual information, which may contradict the macroscopic properties of the whole system. Further, we harness currently popular neural discrete learning to unveil the underlying important features in its latent space, this process better injects interpretability, which can help us obtain a powerful prior over these discrete random variables. We conduct extensive experiments and ablations to demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves large performance margins, compared with the existing SOTA baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Motion-Aware Video Frame Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02892v1)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video frame interpolation methodologies endeavor to create novel frames betwixt extant ones, with the intent of augmenting the video's frame frequency. However, current methods are prone to image blurring and spurious artifacts in challenging scenarios involving occlusions and discontinuous motion. Moreover, they typically rely on optical flow estimation, which adds complexity to modeling and computational costs. To address these issues, we introduce a Motion-Aware Video Frame Interpolation (MA-VFI) network, which directly estimates intermediate optical flow from consecutive frames by introducing a novel hierarchical pyramid module. It not only extracts global semantic relationships and spatial details from input frames with different receptive fields, enabling the model to capture intricate motion patterns, but also effectively reduces the required computational cost and complexity. Subsequently, a cross-scale motion structure is presented to estimate and refine intermediate flow maps by the extracted features. This approach facilitates the interplay between input frame features and flow maps during the frame interpolation process and markedly heightens the precision of the intervening flow delineations. Finally, a discerningly fashioned loss centered around an intermediate flow is meticulously contrived, serving as a deft rudder to skillfully guide the prognostication of said intermediate flow, thereby substantially refining the precision of the intervening flow mappings. Experiments illustrate that MA-VFI surpasses several representative VFI methods across various datasets, and can enhance efficiency while maintaining commendable efficacy.</p></details> |  | None |

Tracking-by-detection has long been a dominant paradigm for object tracking of specific object categories. Recently, large-scale pre-trained models have shown promising advances in detecting and segmenting objects and parts in 2D static images in the wild. This begs the question: can we re-purpose these large-scale pre-trained static image models for open-vocabulary video tracking? In this paper, we re-purpose an open-vocabulary detector, segmenter, and dense optical flow estimator, into a model that tracks and segments objects of any category in 2D videos. Our method predicts object and part tracks with associated language descriptions in monocular videos, rebuilding the pipeline of Tractor with modern large pre-trained models for static image detection and segmentation: we detect open-vocabulary object instances and propagate their boxes from frame to frame using a flow-based motion model, refine the propagated boxes with the box regression module of the visual detector, and prompt an open-world segmenter with the refined box to segment the objects. We decide the termination of an object track based on the objectness score of the propagated boxes, as well as forward-backward optical flow consistency. We re-identify objects across occlusions using deep feature matching. We show that our model achieves strong performance on multiple established video object segmentation and tracking benchmarks, and can produce reasonable tracks in manipulation data. In particular, our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art in UVO and BURST, benchmarks for open-world object tracking and segmentation, despite never being explicitly trained for tracking. We hope that our approach can serve as a simple and extensible framework for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at https://wenhsuanchu.github.io/ovtracktor/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wenhsuanchu.github.io/ovtracktor) |

Recently, detector-free methods present generally better performance but are not satisfactory in image pairs with large scale differences. In this paper, we propose Patch Area Transportation with Subdivision (PATS) to tackle this issue. Instead of building an expensive image pyramid, we start by splitting the original image pair into equal-sized patches and gradually resizing and subdividing them into smaller patches with the same scale. However, estimating scale differences between these patches is non-trivial since the scale differences are determined by both relative camera poses and scene structures, and thus spatially varying over image pairs. Moreover, it is hard to obtain the ground truth for real scenes. To this end, we propose patch area transportation, which enables learning scale differences in a self-supervised manner. In contrast to bipartite graph matching, which only handles one-to-one matching, our patch area transportation can deal with many-to-many relationships. PATS improves both matching accuracy and coverage, and shows superior performance in downstream tasks, such as relative pose estimation, visual localization, and optical flow estimation.

| **[YOIO: You Only Iterate Once by mining and fusing multiple necessary global information in the optical flow estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05879v1)** | 2024-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occlusions pose a significant challenge to optical flow algorithms that even rely on global evidences. We consider an occluded point to be one that is imaged in the reference frame but not in the next. Estimating the motion of these points is extremely difficult, particularly in the two-frame setting. Previous work only used the current frame as the only input, which could not guarantee providing correct global reference information for occluded points, and had problems such as long calculation time and poor accuracy in predicting optical flow at occluded points. To enable both high accuracy and efficiency, We fully mine and utilize the spatiotemporal information provided by the frame pair, design a loopback judgment algorithm to ensure that correct global reference information is obtained, mine multiple necessary global information, and design an efficient refinement module that fuses these global information. Specifically, we propose a YOIO framework, which consists of three main components: an initial flow estimator, a multiple global information extraction module, and a unified refinement module. We demonstrate that optical flow estimates in the occluded regions can be significantly improved in only one iteration without damaging the performance in non-occluded regions. Compared with GMA, the optical flow prediction accuracy of this method in the occluded area is improved by more than 10%, and the occ_out area exceeds 15%, while the calculation time is 27% shorter. This approach, running up to 18.9fps with 436*1024 image resolution, obtains new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel dataset among all published and unpublished approaches that can run in real-time, suggesting a new paradigm for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2104.02409 by other authors</p></details> | None |

An efficient network should skip iterations when the flow improvement is limited. In this paper, we develop a Context-Aware Iteration Policy Network for efficient optical flow estimation, which determines the optimal number of iterations per sample. The policy network achieves this by learning contextual information to realize whether flow improvement is bottlenecked or minimal. On the one hand, we use iteration embedding and historical hidden cell, which include previous iterations information, to convey how flow has changed from previous iterations. On the other hand, we use the incremental loss to make the policy network implicitly perceive the magnitude of optical flow improvement in the subsequent iteration. Furthermore, the computational complexity in our dynamic network is controllable, allowing us to satisfy various resource preferences with a single trained model. Our policy network can be easily integrated into state-of-the-art optical flow networks. Extensive experiments show that our method maintains performance while reducing FLOPs by about 40%/20% for the Sintel/KITTI datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024,...</summary><p>2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence</p></details> | None |

A shortage of datasets significantly constrains the real-world performance of optical flow models. Building virtual datasets that resemble real scenarios offers a potential solution for performance enhancement, yet a domain gap separates virtual and real datasets. This paper introduces FlowDA, an unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) framework for optical flow estimation. FlowDA employs a UDA architecture based on mean-teacher and integrates concepts and techniques in unsupervised optical flow estimation. Furthermore, an Adaptive Curriculum Weighting (ACW) module based on curriculum learning is proposed to enhance the training effectiveness. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that our FlowDA outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised optical flow estimation method SMURF by 21.6%, real optical flow dataset generation method MPI-Flow by 27.8%, and optical flow estimation adaptive method FlowSupervisor by 30.9%, offering novel insights for enhancing the performance of optical flow estimation in real-world scenarios.

We propose a novel end-to-end approach that leverages the learning of dense pixel-wise flow fields in pairs of ground and satellite images to calculate the camera pose. Our approach differs from existing methods by constructing the feature metric at the pixel level, enabling full-image supervision for learning distinctive geometric configurations and visual appearances across views. Specifically, our method employs two distinct convolution networks for ground and satellite feature extraction. Then, we project the ground feature map to the bird's eye view (BEV) using a fixed camera height assumption to achieve preliminary geometric alignment. To further establish content association between the BEV and satellite features, we introduce a residual convolution block to refine the projected BEV feature. Optical flow estimation is performed on the refined BEV feature map and the satellite feature map using flow decoder networks based on RAFT. After obtaining dense flow correspondences, we apply the least square method to filter matching inliers and regress the ground camera pose. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach reduces the median localization error by 89%, 19%, 80% and 35% on the KITTI, Ford multi-AV, VIGOR and Oxford RobotCar datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the limitation of model structures and training datasets, existing methods often rely too much on local clues and ignore the integrity of objects, resulting in fragmented motion estimation. Through theoretical analysis, we find the pre-trained large vision models are helpful in optical flow estimation, and we notice that the recently famous Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates a strong ability to segment complete objects, which is suitable for solving the fragmentation problem. We thus propose a solution to embed the frozen SAM image encoder into FlowFormer to enhance object perception. To address the challenge of in-depth utilizing SAM in non-segmentation tasks like optical flow estimation, we propose an Optical Flow Task-Specific Adaption scheme, including a Context Fusion Module to fuse the SAM encoder with the optical flow context encoder, and a Context Adaption Module to adapt the SAM features for optical flow task with Learned Task-Specific Embedding. Our proposed SAMFlow model reaches 0.86/2.10 clean/final EPE and 3.55/12.32 EPE/F1-all on Sintel and KITTI-15 training set, surpassing Flowformer by 8.5%/9.9% and 13.2%/16.3%.

It is widely utilized in video segmentation tasks. However, existing optical flow-based methods have a significant dependency on optical flow, which results in poor performance when the optical flow estimation fails for a particular scene. The temporal consistency provided by the optical flow could be effectively supplemented by modeling in a structural form. This paper proposes a new hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) architecture, dubbed hierarchical graph pattern understanding (HGPU), for zero-shot video object segmentation (ZS-VOS). Inspired by the strong ability of GNNs in capturing structural relations, HGPU innovatively leverages motion cues (\ie, optical flow) to enhance the high-order representations from the neighbors of target frames. Specifically, a hierarchical graph pattern encoder with message aggregation is introduced to acquire different levels of motion and appearance features in a sequential manner. Furthermore, a decoder is designed for hierarchically parsing and understanding the transformed multi-modal contexts to achieve more accurate and robust results. HGPU achieves state-of-the-art performance on four publicly available benchmarks (DAVIS-16, YouTube-Objects, Long-Videos and DAVIS-17).

We show that they also excel in estimating optical flow and monocular depth, surprisingly, without task-specific architectures and loss functions that are predominant for these tasks. Compared to the point estimates of conventional regression-based methods, diffusion models also enable Monte Carlo inference, e.g., capturing uncertainty and ambiguity in flow and depth. With self-supervised pre-training, the combined use of synthetic and real data for supervised training, and technical innovations (infilling and step-unrolled denoising diffusion training) to handle noisy-incomplete training data, and a simple form of coarse-to-fine refinement, one can train state-of-the-art diffusion models for depth and optical flow estimation. Extensive experiments focus on quantitative performance against benchmarks, ablations, and the model's ability to capture uncertainty and multimodality, and impute missing values. Our model, DDVM (Denoising Diffusion Vision Model), obtains a state-of-the-art relative depth error of 0.074 on the indoor NYU benchmark and an Fl-all outlier rate of 3.26\% on the KITTI optical flow benchmark, about 25\% better than the best published method.

Capsules, on the other hand, are specialized to model seperate entities and their pose as a continuous matrix.

Because of these properties, they are well-suited for processing fast motions that require rapid reactions. Although event cameras have recently shown competitive performance in unsupervised optical flow estimation, performance in detecting independently moving objects (IMOs) is lacking behind, although event-based methods would be suited for this task based on their low latency and HDR properties. Previous approaches to event-based IMO segmentation have been heavily dependent on labeled data. However, biological vision systems have developed the ability to avoid moving objects through daily tasks without being given explicit labels. In this work, we propose the first event framework that generates IMO pseudo-labels using geometric constraints. Due to its unsupervised nature, our method can handle an arbitrary number of not predetermined objects and is easily scalable to datasets where expensive IMO labels are not readily available. We evaluate our approach on the EVIMO dataset and show that it performs competitively with supervised methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  | None |

The inherent ambiguity introduced by occlusions directly violates the brightness constancy constraint and considerably hinders pixel-to-pixel matching. To address this issue, multi-frame optical flow methods leverage adjacent frames to mitigate the local ambiguity. Nevertheless, prior multi-frame methods predominantly adopt recursive flow estimation, resulting in a considerable computational overlap. In contrast, we propose a streamlined in-batch framework that eliminates the need for extensive redundant recursive computations while concurrently developing effective spatio-temporal modeling approaches under in-batch estimation constraints. Specifically, we present a Streamlined In-batch Multi-frame (SIM) pipeline tailored to video input, attaining a similar level of time efficiency to two-frame networks. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient Integrative Spatio-temporal Coherence (ISC) modeling method for effective spatio-temporal modeling during the encoding phase, which introduces no additional parameter overhead. Additionally, we devise a Global Temporal Regressor (GTR) that effectively explores temporal relations during decoding. Benefiting from the efficient SIM pipeline and effective modules, StreamFlow not only excels in terms of performance on the challenging KITTI and Sintel datasets, with particular improvement in occluded areas but also attains a remarkable $63.82\%$ enhancement in speed compared with previous multi-frame methods.

Along with scene object information, visual stimulation can be primarily indicated by optical flow, which characterizes the motion pattern, such as the intensity and direction of the moving image. We estimated the real time optical flow in 360-degree videos targeted at immersive user interactive visualization based on the user's current viewport. The proposed method allows the estimation of customized visual flow for each experience of dynamic 360-degree videos and is an improvement over previous methods that consider a single optical flow value for the entire equirectangular frame. We applied our method to modulate the opacity of granulated rest frames (GRFs), a technique consisting of visual noise-like randomly distributed visual references that are stable to the user's body during immersive pre-recorded 360-degree video experience. We report the results of a pilot one-session between-subject study with 18 participants, where users watched a 2-minute high-intensity 360-degree video. The results show that our proposed method successfully estimates optical flow, with pilot data showing that GRFs combined with real-time optical flow estimation may improve user comfort when watching 360-degree videos.

Despite extensive research in cognitive neuroscience, image-computable models that can extract informative motion flow from natural scenes in a manner consistent with human visual processing have yet to be established. Meanwhile, recent advancements in computer vision (CV), propelled by deep learning, have led to significant progress in optical flow estimation, a task closely related to motion perception. Here we propose an image-computable model of human motion perception by bridging the gap between biological and CV models. Specifically, we introduce a novel two-stages approach that combines trainable motion energy sensing with a recurrent self-attention network for adaptive motion integration and segregation. This model architecture aims to capture the computations in V1-MT, the core structure for motion perception in the biological visual system, while providing the ability to derive informative motion flow for a wide range of stimuli, including complex natural scenes. In silico neurophysiology reveals that our model's unit responses are similar to mammalian neural recordings regarding motion pooling and speed tuning. The proposed model can also replicate human responses to a range of stimuli examined in past psychophysical studies. The experimental results on the Sintel benchmark demonstrate that our model predicts human responses better than the ground truth, whereas the state-of-the-art CV models show the opposite. Our study provides a computational architecture consistent with human visual motion processing, although the physiological correspondence may not be exact.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[CCMR: High Resolution Optical Flow Estimation via Coarse-to-Fine Context-Guided Motion Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02661v1)** | 2023-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention-based motion aggregation concepts have recently shown their usefulness in optical flow estimation, in particular when it comes to handling occluded regions. However, due to their complexity, such concepts have been mainly restricted to coarse-resolution single-scale approaches that fail to provide the detailed outcome of high-resolution multi-scale networks. In this paper, we hence propose CCMR: a high-resolution coarse-to-fine approach that leverages attention-based motion grouping concepts to multi-scale optical flow estimation. CCMR relies on a hierarchical two-step attention-based context-motion grouping strategy that first computes global multi-scale context features and then uses them to guide the actual motion grouping. As we iterate both steps over all coarse-to-fine scales, we adapt cross covariance image transformers to allow for an efficient realization while maintaining scale-dependent properties. Experiments and ablations demonstrate that our efforts of combining multi-scale and attention-based concepts pay off. By providing highly detailed flow fields with strong improvements in both occluded and non-occluded regions, our CCMR approach not only outperforms both the corresponding single-scale attention-based and multi-scale attention-free baselines by up to 23.0% and 21.6%, respectively, it also achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first on KITTI 2015 and second on MPI Sintel Clean and Final.

| **[EmerNeRF: Emergent Spatial-Temporal Scene Decomposition via Self-Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02077v1)** | 2023-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present EmerNeRF, a simple yet powerful approach for learning spatial-temporal representations of dynamic driving scenes. Grounded in neural fields, EmerNeRF simultaneously captures scene geometry, appearance, motion, and semantics via self-bootstrapping. EmerNeRF hinges upon two core components: First, it stratifies scenes into static and dynamic fields. This decomposition emerges purely from self-supervision, enabling our model to learn from general, in-the-wild data sources. Second, EmerNeRF parameterizes an induced flow field from the dynamic field and uses this flow field to further aggregate multi-frame features, amplifying the rendering precision of dynamic objects. Coupling these three fields (static, dynamic, and flow) enables EmerNeRF to represent highly-dynamic scenes self-sufficiently, without relying on ground truth object annotations or pre-trained models for dynamic object segmentation or optical flow estimation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in sensor simulation, significantly outperforming previous methods when reconstructing static (+2.93 PSNR) and dynamic (+3.70 PSNR) scenes. In addition, to bolster EmerNeRF's semantic generalization, we lift 2D visual foundation model features into 4D space-time and address a general positional bias in modern Transformers, significantly boosting 3D perception performance (e.g., 37.50% relative improvement in occupancy prediction accuracy on average). Finally, we construct a diverse and challenging 120-sequence dataset to benchmark neural fields under extreme and highly-dynamic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>See t...</summary><p>See the project page for code, data, and request pre-trained models: https://emernerf.github.io</p></details> | None |

Walking sticks used by them can only give them information about the obstacles in the stick's proximity. Moreover, it is mostly effective in static or very slow-paced environments. Hence, this paper introduces a method to guide them in a busy street. To create such a system it is very important to know about the approaching object and its direction of approach. To achieve this objective we created a method in which the image frame received from the video is divided into three parts i.e. center, left, and right to know the direction of approach of the approaching object. Object detection is done using YOLOv3. Lucas Kanade's optical flow estimation method is used for the optical flow estimation and Depth-net is used for depth estimation. Using the depth information, object motion trajectory, and object category information, the model provides necessary information/warning to the person. This model has been tested in the real world to show its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Anytime Optical Flow Estimation with Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05033v2)** | 2023-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation is a fundamental task in the field of autonomous driving. Event cameras are capable of responding to log-brightness changes in microseconds. Its characteristic of producing responses only to the changing region is particularly suitable for optical flow estimation. In contrast to the super low-latency response speed of event cameras, existing datasets collected via event cameras, however, only provide limited frame rate optical flow ground truth, (e.g., at 10Hz), greatly restricting the potential of event-driven optical flow. To address this challenge, we put forward a high-frame-rate, low-latency event representation Unified Voxel Grid, sequentially fed into the network bin by bin. We then propose EVA-Flow, an EVent-based Anytime Flow estimation network to produce high-frame-rate event optical flow with only low-frame-rate optical flow ground truth for supervision. The key component of our EVA-Flow is the stacked Spatiotemporal Motion Refinement (SMR) module, which predicts temporally dense optical flow and enhances the accuracy via spatial-temporal motion refinement. The time-dense feature warping utilized in the SMR module provides implicit supervision for the intermediate optical flow. Additionally, we introduce the Rectified Flow Warp Loss (RFWL) for the unsupervised evaluation of intermediate optical flow in the absence of ground truth. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work focusing on anytime optical flow estimation via event cameras. A comprehensive variety of experiments on MVSEC, DESC, and our EVA-FlowSet demonstrates that EVA-Flow achieves competitive performance, super-low-latency (5ms), fastest inference (9.2ms), time-dense motion estimation (200Hz), and strong generalization.

As a direct measure of the shear-induced friction forces, an accurate prediction of the wall-shear stress can contribute to sustainability, conservation of resources, and carbon neutrality in civil aviation as well as enhanced medical treatment of vascular diseases and cancer. Despite such importance for our modern society, we still lack adequate experimental methods to capture the instantaneous wall-shear stress dynamics. In this contribution, we present a holistic approach that derives velocity and wall-shear stress fields with impressive spatial and temporal resolution from flow measurements using a deep optical flow estimator with physical knowledge. The validity and physical correctness of the derived flow quantities is demonstrated with synthetic and real-world experimental data covering a range of relevant fluid flows.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Event-based Temporally Dense Optical Flow Estimation with Sequential Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01244v2)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras provide an advantage over traditional frame-based cameras when capturing fast-moving objects without a motion blur. They achieve this by recording changes in light intensity (known as events), thus allowing them to operate at a much higher frequency and making them suitable for capturing motions in a highly dynamic scene. Many recent studies have proposed methods to train neural networks (NNs) for predicting optical flow from events. However, they often rely on a spatio-temporal representation constructed from events over a fixed interval, such as 10Hz used in training on the DSEC dataset. This limitation restricts the flow prediction to the same interval (10Hz) whereas the fast speed of event cameras, which can operate up to 3kHz, has not been effectively utilized. In this work, we show that a temporally dense flow estimation at 100Hz can be achieved by treating the flow estimation as a sequential problem using two different variants of recurrent networks - Long-short term memory (LSTM) and spiking neural network (SNN). First, We utilize the NN model constructed similar to the popular EV-FlowNet but with LSTM layers to demonstrate the efficiency of our training method. The model not only produces 10x more frequent optical flow than the existing ones, but the estimated flows also have 13% lower errors than predictions from the baseline EV-FlowNet. Second, we construct an EV-FlowNet SNN but with leaky integrate and fire neurons to efficiently capture the temporal dynamics. We found that simple inherent recurrent dynamics of SNN lead to significant parameter reduction compared to the LSTM model. In addition, because of its event-driven computation, the spiking model is estimated to consume only 1.5% energy of the LSTM model, highlighting the efficiency of SNN in processing events and the potential for achieving temporally dense flow.</p></details> |  | None |

As the difficulty of collecting ground truth optical flow in real-world scenarios, most of the existing methods of learning optical flow still adopt synthetic dataset for supervised training or utilize photometric consistency across temporally adjacent video frames to drive the unsupervised learning, where the former typically has issues of generalizability while the latter usually performs worse than the supervised ones. To tackle such challenges, we propose to leverage the geometric connection between optical flow estimation and stereo matching (based on the similarity upon finding pixel correspondences across images) to unify various real-world depth estimation datasets for generating supervised training data upon optical flow. Specifically, we turn the monocular depth datasets into stereo ones via synthesizing virtual disparity, thus leading to the flows along the horizontal direction; moreover, we introduce virtual camera motion into stereo data to produce additional flows along the vertical direction. Furthermore, we propose applying geometric augmentations on one image of an optical flow pair, encouraging the optical flow estimator to learn from more challenging cases. Lastly, as the optical flow maps under different geometric augmentations actually exhibit distinct characteristics, an auxiliary classifier which trains to identify the type of augmentation from the appearance of the flow map is utilized to further enhance the learning of the optical flow estimator. Our proposed method is general and is not tied to any particular flow estimator, where extensive experiments based on various datasets and optical flow estimation models verify its efficacy and superiority.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FocusFlow: Boosting Key-Points Optical Flow Estimation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07104v2)** | 2023-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Key-point-based scene understanding is fundamental for autonomous driving applications. At the same time, optical flow plays an important role in many vision tasks. However, due to the implicit bias of equal attention on all points, classic data-driven optical flow estimation methods yield less satisfactory performance on key points, limiting their implementations in key-point-critical safety-relevant scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a points-based modeling method that requires the model to learn key-point-related priors explicitly. Based on the modeling method, we present FocusFlow, a framework consisting of 1) a mix loss function combined with a classic photometric loss function and our proposed Conditional Point Control Loss (CPCL) function for diverse point-wise supervision; 2) a conditioned controlling model which substitutes the conventional feature encoder by our proposed Condition Control Encoder (CCE). CCE incorporates a Frame Feature Encoder (FFE) that extracts features from frames, a Condition Feature Encoder (CFE) that learns to control the feature extraction behavior of FFE from input masks containing information of key points, and fusion modules that transfer the controlling information between FFE and CFE. Our FocusFlow framework shows outstanding performance with up to +44.5% precision improvement on various key points such as ORB, SIFT, and even learning-based SiLK, along with exceptional scalability for most existing data-driven optical flow methods like PWC-Net, RAFT, and FlowFormer.

| **[MPI-Flow: Learning Realistic Optical Flow with Multiplane Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06714v1)** | 2023-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of learning-based optical flow estimation models heavily relies on the realism of the training datasets. Current approaches for generating such datasets either employ synthetic data or generate images with limited realism. However, the domain gap of these data with real-world scenes constrains the generalization of the trained model to real-world applications. To address this issue, we investigate generating realistic optical flow datasets from real-world images. Firstly, to generate highly realistic new images, we construct a layered depth representation, known as multiplane images (MPI), from single-view images. This allows us to generate novel view images that are highly realistic. To generate optical flow maps that correspond accurately to the new image, we calculate the optical flows of each plane using the camera matrix and plane depths. We then project these layered optical flows into the output optical flow map with volume rendering. Secondly, to ensure the realism of motion, we present an independent object motion module that can separate the camera and dynamic object motion in MPI. This module addresses the deficiency in MPI-based single-view methods, where optical flow is generated only by camera motion and does not account for any object movement. We additionally devise a depth-aware inpainting module to merge new images with dynamic objects and address unnatural motion occlusions. We show the superior performance of our method through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Moreover, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unsupervised and supervised training of learning-based models.

Dynamic objects become the most hard problems in inter-frame-supervised depth estimates due to the uncertainty in adjacent frames. Thus, integrating optical flow information with depth estimation is a feasible solution, as the optical flow is an essential motion representation. In this work, we construct a joint inter-frame-supervised depth and optical flow estimation framework, which predicts depths in various motions by minimizing pixel wrap errors in bilateral photometric re-projections and optical vectors. For motion segmentation, we adaptively segment the preliminary estimated optical flow map with large areas of connectivity. In self-supervised depth estimation, different motion regions are predicted independently and then composite into a complete depth. Further, the pose and depth estimations re-synthesize the optical flow maps, serving to compute reconstruction errors with the preliminary predictions. Our proposed joint depth and optical flow estimation outperforms existing depth estimators on the KITTI Depth dataset, both with and without Cityscapes pretraining. Additionally, our optical flow results demonstrate competitive performance on the KITTI Flow 2015 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[AccFlow: Backward Accumulation for Long-Range Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13133v1)** | 2023-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep learning-based optical flow estimators have exhibited impressive performance in generating local flows between consecutive frames. However, the estimation of long-range flows between distant frames, particularly under complex object deformation and large motion occlusion, remains a challenging task. One promising solution is to accumulate local flows explicitly or implicitly to obtain the desired long-range flow. Nevertheless, the accumulation errors and flow misalignment can hinder the effectiveness of this approach. This paper proposes a novel recurrent framework called AccFlow, which recursively backward accumulates local flows using a deformable module called as AccPlus. In addition, an adaptive blending module is designed along with AccPlus to alleviate the occlusion effect by backward accumulation and rectify the accumulation error. Notably, we demonstrate the superiority of backward accumulation over conventional forward accumulation, which to the best of our knowledge has not been explicitly established before. To train and evaluate the proposed AccFlow, we have constructed a large-scale high-quality dataset named CVO, which provides ground-truth optical flow labels between adjacent and distant frames. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AccFlow in handling long-range optical flow estimation.

Temporal redundancy has led to a high masking ratio and customized masking strategy in VideoMAE. In this paper, we aim to further improve the performance of video masked autoencoding by introducing a motion guided masking strategy. Our key insight is that motion is a general and unique prior in video, which should be taken into account during masked pre-training. Our motion guided masking explicitly incorporates motion information to build temporal consistent masking volume. Based on this masking volume, we can track the unmasked tokens in time and sample a set of temporal consistent cubes from videos. These temporal aligned unmasked tokens will further relieve the information leakage issue in time and encourage the MGMAE to learn more useful structure information. We implement our MGMAE with an online efficient optical flow estimator and backward masking map warping strategy. We perform experiments on the datasets of Something-Something V2 and Kinetics-400, demonstrating the superior performance of our MGMAE to the original VideoMAE. In addition, we provide the visualization analysis to illustrate that our MGMAE can sample temporal consistent cubes in a motion-adaptive manner for more effective video pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2023 camera-ready version</p></details> | None |
| **[TMA: Temporal Motion Aggregation for Event-based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11629v2)** | 2023-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras have the ability to record continuous and detailed trajectories of objects with high temporal resolution, thereby providing intuitive motion cues for optical flow estimation. Nevertheless, most existing learning-based approaches for event optical flow estimation directly remould the paradigm of conventional images by representing the consecutive event stream as static frames, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of event data. In this paper, we argue that temporal continuity is a vital element of event-based optical flow and propose a novel Temporal Motion Aggregation (TMA) approach to unlock its potential. Technically, TMA comprises three components: an event splitting strategy to incorporate intermediate motion information underlying the temporal context, a linear lookup strategy to align temporally fine-grained motion features and a novel motion pattern aggregation module to emphasize consistent patterns for motion feature enhancement. By incorporating temporally fine-grained motion information, TMA can derive better flow estimates than existing methods at early stages, which not only enables TMA to obtain more accurate final predictions, but also greatly reduces the demand for a number of refinements. Extensive experiments on DSEC-Flow and MVSEC datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of our TMA. Remarkably, compared to E-RAFT, TMA achieves a 6\% improvement in accuracy and a 40\% reduction in inference time on DSEC-Flow.

In contrast to previous methods that learn to estimate optical flow from two frames, VideoFlow concurrently estimates bi-directional optical flows for multiple frames that are available in videos by sufficiently exploiting temporal cues. We first propose a TRi-frame Optical Flow (TROF) module that estimates bi-directional optical flows for the center frame in a three-frame manner. The information of the frame triplet is iteratively fused onto the center frame. To extend TROF for handling more frames, we further propose a MOtion Propagation (MOP) module that bridges multiple TROFs and propagates motion features between adjacent TROFs. With the iterative flow estimation refinement, the information fused in individual TROFs can be propagated into the whole sequence via MOP. By effectively exploiting video information, VideoFlow presents extraordinary performance, ranking 1st on all public benchmarks. On the Sintel benchmark, VideoFlow achieves 1.649 and 0.991 average end-point-error (AEPE) on the final and clean passes, a 15.1% and 7.6% error reduction from the best-published results (1.943 and 1.073 from FlowFormer++). On the KITTI-2015 benchmark, VideoFlow achieves an F1-all error of 3.65%, a 19.2% error reduction from the best-published result (4.52% from FlowFormer++).

This additional information is injected into the encoder and into a learned upsampler that refines the flow output. In addition, a simple yet effective semantic augmentation module provides self-supervision when learning flow and its boundaries for vehicles, poles, and sky. Together, these injections of semantic information improve the KITTI-2015 optical flow test error rate from 11.80% to 8.38%.

However, they hardly consider that most videos are compressed and thus ignore the pre-computed information in compressed video streams. Motion vectors, one of the compression information, record the motion of the video frames. They can be directly extracted from the compression code stream without computational cost and serve as a solid prior for optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose an optical flow model, MVFlow, which uses motion vectors to improve the speed and accuracy of optical flow estimation for compressed videos. In detail, MVFlow includes a key Motion-Vector Converting Module, which ensures that the motion vectors can be transformed into the same domain of optical flow and then be utilized fully by the flow estimation module. Meanwhile, we construct four optical flow datasets for compressed videos containing frames and motion vectors in pairs. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MVFlow, which can reduce the AEPE by 1.09 compared to existing models or save 52% time to achieve similar accuracy to existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2023</p></details> | None |

We unify the two approaches and introduce MC-JEPA, a joint-embedding predictive architecture and self-supervised learning approach to jointly learn optical flow and content features within a shared encoder, demonstrating that the two associated objectives; the optical flow estimation objective and the self-supervised learning objective; benefit from each other and thus learn content features that incorporate motion information.

Some methods insert stacked transformer modules that allow the network to use global information of cost volume for estimation. But the global information aggregation often incurs serious memory and time costs during training and inference, which hinders model deployment. We draw inspiration from the traditional local region constraint and design the local similarity aggregation (LSA) and the shifted local similarity aggregation (SLSA). The aggregation for cost volume is implemented with lightweight modules that act on the feature maps.

| **[Latent Graph Attention for Enhanced Spatial Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04149v2)** | 2023-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global contexts in images are quite valuable in image-to-image translation problems. Conventional attention-based and graph-based models capture the global context to a large extent, however, these are computationally expensive. Moreover, the existing approaches are limited to only learning the pairwise semantic relation between any two points on the image. In this paper, we present Latent Graph Attention (LGA) a computationally inexpensive (linear to the number of nodes) and stable, modular framework for incorporating the global context in the existing architectures, especially empowering small-scale architectures to give performance closer to large size architectures, thus making the light-weight architectures more useful for edge devices with lower compute power and lower energy needs. LGA propagates information spatially using a network of locally connected graphs, thereby facilitating to construct a semantically coherent relation between any two spatially distant points that also takes into account the influence of the intermediate pixels. Moreover, the depth of the graph network can be used to adapt the extent of contextual spread to the target dataset, thereby being able to explicitly control the added computational cost. To enhance the learning mechanism of LGA, we also introduce a novel contrastive loss term that helps our LGA module to couple well with the original architecture at the expense of minimal additional computational load. We show that incorporating LGA improves the performance on three challenging applications, namely transparent object segmentation, image restoration for dehazing and optical flow estimation.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures | None |

And we design layer attention to dynamically fuse these features. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised learning method for optical flow estimation in a spike-based manner to break the dependence on labeled data. In addition, to verify the robustness, we also build a spike-based synthetic validation dataset for extreme scenarios in autonomous driving, denoted as SSES dataset. It consists of various corner cases. Experiments show that our method can predict optical flow from spike streams in different high-speed scenes, including real scenes. For instance, our method gets $15\%$ and $19\%$ error reduction from the best spike-based work, SCFlow, in $\Delta t=10$ and $\Delta t=20$ respectively which are the same settings as the previous works.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Offline and Online Optical Flow Enhancement for Deep Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05092v1)** | 2023-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video compression relies heavily on exploiting the temporal redundancy between video frames, which is usually achieved by estimating and using the motion information. The motion information is represented as optical flows in most of the existing deep video compression networks. Indeed, these networks often adopt pre-trained optical flow estimation networks for motion estimation. The optical flows, however, may be less suitable for video compression due to the following two factors. First, the optical flow estimation networks were trained to perform inter-frame prediction as accurately as possible, but the optical flows themselves may cost too many bits to encode. Second, the optical flow estimation networks were trained on synthetic data, and may not generalize well enough to real-world videos. We address the twofold limitations by enhancing the optical flows in two stages: offline and online. In the offline stage, we fine-tune a trained optical flow estimation network with the motion information provided by a traditional (non-deep) video compression scheme, e.g. H.266/VVC, as we believe the motion information of H.266/VVC achieves a better rate-distortion trade-off. In the online stage, we further optimize the latent features of the optical flows with a gradient descent-based algorithm for the video to be compressed, so as to enhance the adaptivity of the optical flows. We conduct experiments on a state-of-the-art deep video compression scheme, DCVC. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed offline and online enhancement together achieves on average 12.8% bitrate saving on the tested videos, without increasing the model or computational complexity of the decoder side.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

The task is challenging due to the nonlinearity of optical flow observables. Our proposed Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) control scheme incorporates an efficient data-driven method to address the nonlinearity. It directly estimates the inverse of the time-varying control effectiveness in real-time, eliminating the need for the constant assumption and avoiding high computation in traditional INDI. This approach effectively handles fast-changing system dynamics commonly encountered in optical flow control, particularly height-dependent changes. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed control scheme in numerical simulations and also real-world flight tests: multiple landings of an MAV on a static and flat surface with various tracking setpoints, hovering and landings on moving and undulating surfaces. Despite being challenged with the presence of noisy optical flow estimates and the lateral and vertical movement of the landing surfaces, the MAV is able to successfully track or land on the surface with an exponential decay of both height and vertical velocity at almost the same time, as desired.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing non-rigid structure from motion techniques assume to observe also static scene parts besides deforming scene parts in order to establish an anchoring reference. However, this assumption does not hold true in certain relevant application cases such as endoscopies. Deformable odometry and SLAM pipelines, which tackle the most challenging scenario of exploratory trajectories, suffer from a lack of robustness and proper quantitative evaluation methodologies. To tackle this issue with a common benchmark, we introduce the Drunkard's Dataset, a challenging collection of synthetic data targeting visual navigation and reconstruction in deformable environments. This dataset is the first large set of exploratory camera trajectories with ground truth inside 3D scenes where every surface exhibits non-rigid deformations over time. Simulations in realistic 3D buildings lets us obtain a vast amount of data and ground truth labels, including camera poses, RGB images and depth, optical flow and normal maps at high resolution and quality. We further present a novel deformable odometry method, dubbed the Drunkard's Odometry, which decomposes optical flow estimates into rigid-body camera motion and non-rigid scene deformations. In order to validate our data, our work contains an evaluation of several baselines as well as a novel tracking error metric which does not require ground truth data.

Through extensive quantitative study with a new edge crispness measure, we find that noisy human-labeled edges are the main cause of thick predictions. Based on this observation, we advocate that more attention should be paid on label quality than on model design to achieve crisp edge detection. To this end, we propose an effective Canny-guided refinement of human-labeled edges whose result can be used to train crisp edge detectors. Essentially, it seeks for a subset of over-detected Canny edges that best align human labels. We show that several existing edge detectors can be turned into a crisp edge detector through training on our refined edge maps. Experiments demonstrate that deep models trained with refined edges achieve significant performance boost of crispness from 17.4% to 30.6%. With the PiDiNet backbone, our method improves ODS and OIS by 12.2% and 12.6% on the Multicue dataset, respectively, without relying on non-maximal suppression. We further conduct experiments and show the superiority of our crisp edge detection for optical flow estimation and image segmentation.</p></details> | Accepted by TIP | None |

FlowFormer tokenizes the 4D cost-volume built from the source-target image pair and iteratively refines flow estimation with a cost-volume encoder-decoder architecture. The cost-volume encoder derives a cost memory with alternate-group transformer~(AGT) layers in a latent space and the decoder recurrently decodes flow from the cost memory with dynamic positional cost queries. On the Sintel benchmark, FlowFormer architecture achieves 1.16 and 2.09 average end-point-error~(AEPE) on the clean and final pass, a 16.5\% and 15.5\% error reduction from the GMA~(1.388 and 2.47). MCVA enhances FlowFormer by pretraining the cost-volume encoder with a masked autoencoding scheme, which further unleashes the capability of FlowFormer with unlabeled data. This is especially critical in optical flow estimation because ground truth flows are more expensive to acquire than labels in other vision tasks. MCVA improves FlowFormer all-sided and FlowFormer+MCVA ranks 1st among all published methods on both Sintel and KITTI-2015 benchmarks and achieves the best generalization performance. Specifically, FlowFormer+MCVA achieves 1.07 and 1.94 AEPE on the Sintel benchmark, leading to 7.76\% and 7.18\% error reductions from FlowFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2203.16194, arXiv:2303.01237</p></details> | None |

However, commercial edge platforms based on standard GPUs are not optimized to deploy SNNs, resulting in high energy and latency. While analog In-Memory Computing (IMC) platforms can serve as energy-efficient inference engines, they are accursed by the immense energy, latency, and area requirements of high-precision ADCs (HP-ADC), overshadowing the benefits of in-memory computations. We propose a hardware/software co-design methodology to deploy SNNs into an ADC-Less IMC architecture using sense-amplifiers as 1-bit ADCs replacing conventional HP-ADCs and alleviating the above issues. Our proposed framework incurs minimal accuracy degradation by performing hardware-aware training and is able to scale beyond simple image classification tasks to more complex sequential regression tasks. Experiments on complex tasks of optical flow estimation and gesture recognition show that progressively increasing the hardware awareness during SNN training allows the model to adapt and learn the errors due to the non-idealities associated with ADC-Less IMC. Also, the proposed ADC-Less IMC offers significant energy and latency improvements, $2-7\times$ and $8.9-24.6\times$, respectively, depending on the SNN model and the workload, compared to HP-ADC IMC.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures | None |

On micro and nano UAVs, real-time calculation of the optical flow is run on low power and resource-constrained microcontroller units (MCUs). Thus, lightweight algorithms for optical flow have been proposed targeting real-time execution on traditional single-core MCUs. This paper introduces an efficient parallelization strategy for optical flow computation targeting new-generation multicore low power RISC-V based microcontroller units. Our approach enables higher frame rates at lower clock speeds. It has been implemented and evaluated on the eight-core cluster of a commercial octa-core MCU (GAP8) reaching a parallelization speedup factor of 7.21 allowing for a frame rate of 500 frames per second when running on a 50 MHz clock frequency. The proposed parallel algorithm significantly boosts the camera frame rate on micro unmanned aerial vehicles, which enables higher flight speeds: the maximum flight speed can be doubled, while using less than a third of the clock frequency of previous single-core implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISCAS 2022</p></details> | None |

The key to video restoration depends on utilizing inter-frame information. However, existing deep learning methods often rely on complicated network architectures, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, resulting in high computational costs. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective framework for video restoration. Our approach is based on grouped spatial-temporal shift, which is a lightweight and straightforward technique that can implicitly capture inter-frame correspondences for multi-frame aggregation. By introducing grouped spatial shift, we attain expansive effective receptive fields. Combined with basic 2D convolution, this simple framework can effectively aggregate inter-frame information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, while using less than a quarter of its computational cost, on both video deblurring and video denoising tasks. These results indicate the potential for our approach to significantly reduce computational overhead while maintaining high-quality results.

These sensors operate with asynchronous pixels, emitting events, or "spikes", when the luminance change at a given pixel since the last event surpasses a certain threshold. Thanks to their inherent qualities, such as their low power consumption, low latency and high dynamic range, they seem particularly tailored to applications with challenging temporal constraints and safety requirements. Event-based sensors are an excellent fit for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), since the coupling of an asynchronous sensor with neuromorphic hardware can yield real-time systems with minimal power requirements. In this work, we seek to develop one such system, using both event sensor data from the DSEC dataset and spiking neural networks to estimate optical flow for driving scenarios. We propose a U-Net-like SNN which, after supervised training, is able to make dense optical flow estimations. To do so, we encourage both minimal norm for the error vector and minimal angle between ground-truth and predicted flow, training our model with back-propagation using a surrogate gradient. In addition, the use of 3d convolutions allows us to capture the dynamic nature of the data by increasing the temporal receptive fields. Upsampling after each decoding stage ensures that each decoder's output contributes to the final estimation. Thanks to separable convolutions, we have been able to develop a light model (when compared to competitors) that can nonetheless yield reasonably accurate optical flow estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures and 3 tables, plus Supplementary Materials</p></details> | None |

These benefits have been utilized into many machine vision tasks, especially optical flow estimation. Currently, most existing event-based works use deep learning to estimate optical flow. However, their networks have not fully exploited prior hidden states and motion flows. Additionally, their supervision strategy has not fully leveraged the geometric constraints of event data to unlock the potential of networks. In this paper, we propose EV-MGRFlowNet, an unsupervised event-based optical flow estimation pipeline with motion-guided recurrent networks using a hybrid motion-compensation loss. First, we propose a feature-enhanced recurrent encoder network (FERE-Net) which fully utilizes prior hidden states to obtain multi-level motion features. Then, we propose a flow-guided decoder network (FGD-Net) to integrate prior motion flows. Finally, we design a hybrid motion-compensation loss (HMC-Loss) to strengthen geometric constraints for the more accurate alignment of events. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method on the MVSEC dataset, with an average reduction of approximately 22.71% in average endpoint error (AEE).

In this paper, we propose a new and practical task, named Rotation Correction, to automatically correct the tilt with high content fidelity in the condition that the rotated angle is unknown. This task can be easily integrated into image editing applications, allowing users to correct the rotated images without any manual operations. To this end, we leverage a neural network to predict the optical flows that can warp the tilted images to be perceptually horizontal. Nevertheless, the pixel-wise optical flow estimation from a single image is severely unstable, especially in large-angle tilted images. To enhance its robustness, we propose a simple but effective prediction strategy to form a robust elastic warp. Particularly, we first regress the mesh deformation that can be transformed into robust initial optical flows. Then we estimate residual optical flows to facilitate our network the flexibility of pixel-wise deformation, further correcting the details of the tilted images. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, a comprehensive rotation correction dataset is presented with a large diversity in scenes and rotated angles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even in the absence of the angle prior, our algorithm can outperform other state-of-the-art solutions requiring this prior.

Today's learning approaches are designed to function on digital devices with digital data representations such as image frames. In contrast, biological vision systems are generally much more capable and efficient than state-of-the-art digital computer vision algorithms. Event cameras are an emerging sensor technology which imitates biological vision with asynchronously firing pixels, eschewing the concept of the image frame. To leverage modern learning techniques, many event-based algorithms are forced to accumulate events back to image frames, somewhat squandering the advantages of event cameras. We follow the opposite paradigm and develop a new type of neural network which operates closer to the original event data stream. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in angular velocity regression and competitive optical flow estimation, while avoiding difficulties related to training SNN. Furthermore, the processing latency of our proposed approach is less than 1/10 any other implementation, while continuous inference increases this improvement by another order of magnitude.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, labeling data manually is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To overcome this, using low-cost synthetic data is a promising alternative. This paper introduces a novel video text synthesis technique called FlowText, which utilizes optical flow estimation to synthesize a large amount of text video data at a low cost for training robust video text spotters. Unlike existing methods that focus on image-level synthesis, FlowText concentrates on synthesizing temporal information of text instances across consecutive frames using optical flow. This temporal information is crucial for accurately tracking and spotting text in video sequences, including text movement, distortion, appearance, disappearance, shelter, and blur. Experiments show that combining general detectors like TransDETR with the proposed FlowText produces remarkable results on various datasets, such as ICDAR2015video and ICDAR2013video.

Recent state-of-the-art optical flow estimation algorithms are two-frame based methods where optical flow is estimated sequentially for each consecutive image pair in a sequence. While this approach gives good flow estimates, it fails to generalize optical flows in occluded regions mainly due to limited local evidence regarding moving elements in a scene. In this work, we propose a learning-based multi-frame optical flow estimation method that estimates two or more consecutive optical flows in parallel from multi-frame image sequences. Our underlying hypothesis is that by understanding temporal scene dynamics from longer sequences with more than two frames, we can characterize pixel-wise dependencies in a larger spatiotemporal domain, generalize complex motion patterns and thereby improve the accuracy of optical flow estimates in occluded regions. We present learning-based spatiotemporal recurrent transformers for multi-frame based optical flow estimation (SSTMs). Our method utilizes 3D Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (3D-ConvGRUs) and spatiotemporal transformers to learn recurrent space-time motion dynamics and global dependencies in the scene and provide a generalized optical flow estimation. When compared with recent state-of-the-art two-frame and multi-frame methods on real world and synthetic datasets, performance of the SSTMs were significantly higher in occluded and out-of-boundary regions. Among all published state-of-the-art multi-frame methods, SSTM achieved state-of the-art results on the Sintel Final and KITTI2015 benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 tab...</summary><p>5 tables, 7 figures, MS thesis</p></details> | None |

However, unsupervised learning is likely to be unstable when pixel tracking is lost due to occlusion and motion blur, or the pixel matching is impaired due to variation in image content and spatial structure over time. In natural environments, dynamic occlusion or object variation is a relatively slow temporal process spanning several frames. We, therefore, explore the optical flow estimation from multiple-frame sequences of dynamic scenes, whereas most of the existing unsupervised approaches are based on temporal static models. We handle the unsupervised optical flow estimation with a temporal dynamic model by introducing a spatial-temporal dual recurrent block based on the predictive coding structure, which feeds the previous high-level motion prior to the current optical flow estimator. Assuming temporal smoothness of optical flow, we use motion priors of the adjacent frames to provide more reliable supervision of the occluded regions. To grasp the essence of challenging scenes, we simulate various scenarios across long sequences, including dynamic occlusion, content variation, and spatial variation, and adopt self-supervised distillation to make the model understand the object's motion patterns in a prolonged dynamic environment. Experiments on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Sintel Clean, and Sintel Final datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on unsupervised optical flow estimation.

However, existing ZS-VOS methods often struggle to distinguish between foreground and background or to keep track of the foreground in complex scenarios. The common practice of introducing motion information, such as optical flow, can lead to overreliance on optical flow estimation. To address these challenges, we propose an encoder-decoder-based hierarchical co-attention propagation network (HCPN) capable of tracking and segmenting objects. Specifically, our model is built upon multiple collaborative evolutions of the parallel co-attention module (PCM) and the cross co-attention module (CCM). PCM captures common foreground regions among adjacent appearance and motion features, while CCM further exploits and fuses cross-modal motion features returned by PCM. Our method is progressively trained to achieve hierarchical spatio-temporal feature propagation across the entire video. Experimental results demonstrate that our HCPN outperforms all previous methods on public benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness for ZS-VOS.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> | None |

This information is useful to make inferences about 3D shape, physical properties and object interactions. While the problem of tracking arbitrary physical points on surfaces over longer video clips has received some attention, no dataset or benchmark for evaluation existed, until now. In this paper, we first formalize the problem, naming it tracking any point (TAP). We introduce a companion benchmark, TAP-Vid, which is composed of both real-world videos with accurate human annotations of point tracks, and synthetic videos with perfect ground-truth point tracks. Central to the construction of our benchmark is a novel semi-automatic crowdsourced pipeline which uses optical flow estimates to compensate for easier, short-term motion like camera shake, allowing annotators to focus on harder sections of video.

Based on a mixing ratio, we combine one of the frames in the pair with a distractor image depicting a similar domain, which allows for inducing visual perturbations congruent with natural objects and scenes. We refer to such pairs as distracted pairs. Our intuition is that using semantically meaningful distractors enables the model to learn related variations and attain robustness against challenging deviations, compared to conventional augmentation schemes focusing only on low-level aspects and modifications. More specifically, in addition to the supervised loss computed between the estimated flow for the original pair and its ground-truth flow, we include a second supervised loss defined between the distracted pair's flow and the original pair's ground-truth flow, weighted with the same mixing ratio. Furthermore, when unlabeled data is available, we extend our augmentation approach to self-supervised settings through pseudo-labeling and cross-consistency regularization. Given an original pair and its distracted version, we enforce the estimated flow on the distracted pair to agree with the flow of the original pair. Our approach allows increasing the number of available training pairs significantly without requiring additional annotations. It is agnostic to the model architecture and can be applied to training any optical flow estimation models. Our extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks, including Sintel, KITTI, and SlowFlow, show that DistractFlow improves existing models consistently, outperforming the latest state of the art.</p></details> | CVPR 2023 | None |

Although semi/full-supervised methods have made good attempts, the domain shift between the synthetic and real adverse weather images would deteriorate their performance. To alleviate this issue, our start point is to unsupervisedly transfer the knowledge from source clean domain to target degraded domain. Our key insight is that adverse weather does not change the intrinsic optical flow of the scene, but causes a significant difference for the warp error between clean and degraded images. In this work, we propose the first unsupervised framework for adverse weather optical flow via hierarchical motion-boundary adaptation. Specifically, we first employ image translation to construct the transformation relationship between clean and degraded domains. In motion adaptation, we utilize the flow consistency knowledge to align the cross-domain optical flows into a motion-invariance common space, where the optical flow from clean weather is used as the guidance-knowledge to obtain a preliminary optical flow for adverse weather. Furthermore, we leverage the warp error inconsistency which measures the motion misalignment of the boundary between the clean and degraded domains, and propose a joint intra- and inter-scene boundary contrastive adaptation to refine the motion boundary. The hierarchical motion and boundary adaptation jointly promotes optical flow in a unified framework. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent deep learning based optical flow models have achieved considerable success. However, these models often train networks from the scratch on standard optical flow data, which restricts their ability to robustly and geometrically match image features. In this paper, we propose a rethinking to previous optical flow estimation. We particularly leverage Geometric Image Matching (GIM) as a pre-training task for the optical flow estimation (MatchFlow) with better feature representations, as GIM shares some common challenges as optical flow estimation, and with massive labeled real-world data. Thus, matching static scenes helps to learn more fundamental feature correlations of objects and scenes with consistent displacements. Specifically, the proposed MatchFlow model employs a QuadTree attention-based network pre-trained on MegaDepth to extract coarse features for further flow regression.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their neuro-inspired event-driven processing can efficiently handle such asynchronous data, while neuron models such as the leaky-integrate and fire (LIF) can keep track of the quintessential timing information contained in the inputs. SNNs achieve this by maintaining a dynamic state in the neuron memory, retaining important information while forgetting redundant data over time. Thus, we posit that SNNs would allow for better performance on sequential regression tasks compared to similarly sized Analog Neural Networks (ANNs). However, deep SNNs are difficult to train due to vanishing spikes at later layers. To that effect, we propose an adaptive fully-spiking framework with learnable neuronal dynamics to alleviate the spike vanishing problem. We utilize surrogate gradient-based backpropagation through time (BPTT) to train our deep SNNs from scratch. We validate our approach for the task of optical flow estimation on the Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event-Camera (MVSEC) dataset and the DSEC-Flow dataset. Our experiments on these datasets show an average reduction of 13% in average endpoint error (AEE) compared to state-of-the-art ANNs. We also explore several down-scaled models and observe that our SNN models consistently outperform similarly sized ANNs offering 10%-16% lower AEE. These results demonstrate the importance of SNNs for smaller models and their suitability at the edge. In terms of efficiency, our SNNs offer substantial savings in network parameters (48.3x) and computational energy (10.2x) while attaining ~10% lower EPE compared to the state-of-the-art ANN implementations.</p></details> |  | None |

This enables capturing visual information at fine time granularities (e.g., microseconds) in rapidly changing environments. This makes event cameras highly useful for high-speed robotics tasks involving rapid motion, such as high-speed perception, object tracking, and control. However, convolutional neural network inference on event camera streams cannot currently perform real-time inference at the high speeds at which event cameras operate - current CNN inference times are typically closer in order of magnitude to the frame rates of regular frame-based cameras. Real-time inference at event camera rates is necessary to fully leverage the high frequency and high temporal resolution that event cameras offer. This paper presents EvConv, a new approach to enable fast inference on CNNs for inputs from event cameras. We observe that consecutive inputs to the CNN from an event camera have only small differences between them. Thus, we propose to perform inference on the difference between consecutive input tensors, or the increment. This enables a significant reduction in the number of floating-point operations required (and thus the inference latency) because increments are very sparse. We design EvConv to leverage the irregular sparsity in increments from event cameras and to retain the sparsity of these increments across all layers of the network. We demonstrate a reduction in the number of floating operations required in the forward pass by up to 98%. We also demonstrate a speedup of up to 1.6X for inference using CNNs for tasks such as depth estimation, object recognition, and optical flow estimation, with almost no loss in accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

The core component of FlowFormer is the transformer-based cost-volume encoder. Inspired by the recent success of masked autoencoding (MAE) pretraining in unleashing transformers' capacity of encoding visual representation, we propose Masked Cost Volume Autoencoding (MCVA) to enhance FlowFormer by pretraining the cost-volume encoder with a novel MAE scheme. Firstly, we introduce a block-sharing masking strategy to prevent masked information leakage, as the cost maps of neighboring source pixels are highly correlated. Secondly, we propose a novel pre-text reconstruction task, which encourages the cost-volume encoder to aggregate long-range information and ensures pretraining-finetuning consistency. We also show how to modify the FlowFormer architecture to accommodate masks during pretraining. Pretrained with MCVA, FlowFormer++ ranks 1st among published methods on both Sintel and KITTI-2015 benchmarks. Specifically, FlowFormer++ achieves 1.07 and 1.94 average end-point error (AEPE) on the clean and final pass of Sintel benchmark, leading to 7.76\% and 7.18\% error reductions from FlowFormer. FlowFormer++ obtains 4.52 F1-all on the KITTI-2015 test set, improving FlowFormer by 0.16.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[E-VFIA : Event-Based Video Frame Interpolation with Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09359v3)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video frame interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental vision task that aims to synthesize several frames between two consecutive original video images. Most algorithms aim to accomplish VFI by using only keyframes, which is an ill-posed problem since the keyframes usually do not yield any accurate precision about the trajectories of the objects in the scene. On the other hand, event-based cameras provide more precise information between the keyframes of a video. Some recent state-of-the-art event-based methods approach this problem by utilizing event data for better optical flow estimation to interpolate for video frame by warping. Nonetheless, those methods heavily suffer from the ghosting effect. On the other hand, some of kernel-based VFI methods that only use frames as input, have shown that deformable convolutions, when backed up with transformers, can be a reliable way of dealing with long-range dependencies. We propose event-based video frame interpolation with attention (E-VFIA), as a lightweight kernel-based method. E-VFIA fuses event information with standard video frames by deformable convolutions to generate high quality interpolated frames. The proposed method represents events with high temporal resolution and uses a multi-head self-attention mechanism to better encode event-based information, while being less vulnerable to blurring and ghosting artifacts; thus, generating crispier frames. The simulation results show that the proposed technique outperforms current state-of-the-art methods (both frame and event-based) with a significantly smaller model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2023)</p></details> | None |
| **[Uncertainty-Driven Dense Two-View Structure from Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00523v2)** | 2023-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces an effective and practical solution to the dense two-view structure from motion (SfM) problem. One vital question addressed is how to mindfully use per-pixel optical flow correspondence between two frames for accurate pose estimation -- as perfect per-pixel correspondence between two images is difficult, if not impossible, to establish. With the carefully estimated camera pose and predicted per-pixel optical flow correspondences, a dense depth of the scene is computed. Later, an iterative refinement procedure is introduced to further improve optical flow matching confidence, camera pose, and depth, exploiting their inherent dependency in rigid SfM. The fundamental idea presented is to benefit from per-pixel uncertainty in the optical flow estimation and provide robustness to the dense SfM system via an online refinement. Concretely, we introduce our uncertainty-driven Dense Two-View SfM pipeline (DTV-SfM), consisting of an uncertainty-aware dense optical flow estimation approach that provides per-pixel correspondence with their confidence score of matching; a weighted dense bundle adjustment formulation that depends on optical flow uncertainty and bidirectional optical flow consistency to refine both pose and depth; a depth estimation network that considers its consistency with the estimated poses and optical flow respecting epipolar constraint. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach achieves remarkable depth accuracy and state-of-the-art camera pose results superseding SuperPoint and SuperGlue accuracy when tested on benchmark datasets such as DeMoN, YFCC100M, and ScanNet.

As a remedy, we propose a modified multidomain RGB to TIR image translation model focused on edge preservation to employ annotated RGB images with challenging labels. Our proposed method not only preserves key details in the original image but also leverages the optimal TIR style code to portray accurate TIR characteristics in the translated image, when applied on both synthetic and real world RGB images. Using our translation model, we have enabled the supervised learning of deep TIR image-based optical flow estimation and object detection that ameliorated in deep TIR optical flow estimation by reduction in end point error by 56.5\% on average and the best object detection mAP of 23.9\% respectively.

However, despite the advances of optical flow estimation in perspective videos, the 360$^\circ$ videos counterpart remains in its infancy, primarily due to the shortage of benchmark datasets and the failure to accommodate the omnidirectional nature of 360$^\circ$ videos. We propose the first perceptually realistic 360$^\circ$ filed-of-view video benchmark dataset, namely FLOW360, with 40 different videos and 4,000 video frames. We then conduct comprehensive characteristic analysis and extensive comparisons with existing datasets, manifesting FLOW360's perceptual realism, uniqueness, and diversity. Moreover, we present a novel Siamese representation Learning framework for Omnidirectional Flow (SLOF) estimation, which is trained in a contrastive manner via a hybrid loss that combines siamese contrastive and optical flow losses. By training the model on random rotations of the input omnidirectional frames, our proposed contrastive scheme accommodates the omnidirectional nature of optical flow estimation in 360$^\circ$ videos, resulting in significantly reduced prediction errors. The learning scheme is further proven to be efficient by expanding our siamese learning scheme and omnidirectional optical flow estimation to the egocentric activity recognition task, where the classification accuracy is boosted up to $\sim$26%. To summarize, we study the optical flow estimation in 360$^\circ$ videos problem from perspectives of the benchmark dataset, learning model, and also practical application.

| **[CroCo: Self-Supervised Pre-training for 3D Vision Tasks by Cross-View Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10716v2)** | 2023-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has recently been established as a potent pre-training paradigm. A pretext task is constructed by masking patches in an input image, and this masked content is then predicted by a neural network using visible patches as sole input. This pre-training leads to state-of-the-art performance when finetuned for high-level semantic tasks, e.g. image classification and object detection. In this paper we instead seek to learn representations that transfer well to a wide variety of 3D vision and lower-level geometric downstream tasks, such as depth prediction or optical flow estimation. Inspired by MIM, we propose an unsupervised representation learning task trained from pairs of images showing the same scene from different viewpoints. More precisely, we propose the pretext task of cross-view completion where the first input image is partially masked, and this masked content has to be reconstructed from the visible content and the second image. In single-view MIM, the masked content often cannot be inferred precisely from the visible portion only, so the model learns to act as a prior influenced by high-level semantics. In contrast, this ambiguity can be resolved with cross-view completion from the second unmasked image, on the condition that the model is able to understand the spatial relationship between the two images. Our experiments show that our pretext task leads to significantly improved performance for monocular 3D vision downstream tasks such as depth estimation. In addition, our model can be directly applied to binocular downstream tasks like optical flow or relative camera pose estimation, for which we obtain competitive results without bells and whistles, i.e., using a generic architecture without any task-specific design.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2022 | None |
| **[Optical Flow for Autonomous Driving: Applications, Challenges and Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04422v1)** | 2023-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation is a well-studied topic for automated driving applications. Many outstanding optical flow estimation methods have been proposed, but they become erroneous when tested in challenging scenarios that are commonly encountered. Despite the increasing use of fisheye cameras for near-field sensing in automated driving, there is very limited literature on optical flow estimation with strong lens distortion. Thus we propose and evaluate training strategies to improve a learning-based optical flow algorithm by leveraging the only existing fisheye dataset with optical flow ground truth. While trained with synthetic data, the model demonstrates strong capabilities to generalize to real world fisheye data. The other challenge neglected by existing state-of-the-art algorithms is low light. We propose a novel, generic semi-supervised framework that significantly boosts performances of existing methods in such conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that explicitly handles optical flow estimation in low light.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Electronic Imaging, Autonomous Vehicles and Machines 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Video Semantic Segmentation with Inter-Frame Feature Fusion and Inner-Frame Feature Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03832v1)** | 2023-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate semantic maps for each video frame. To this end, many works dedicate to integrate diverse information from consecutive frames to enhance the features for prediction, where a feature alignment procedure via estimated optical flow is usually required. However, the optical flow would inevitably suffer from inaccuracy, and then introduce noises in feature fusion and further result in unsatisfactory segmentation results. In this paper, to tackle the misalignment issue, we propose a spatial-temporal fusion (STF) module to model dense pairwise relationships among multi-frame features. Different from previous methods, STF uniformly and adaptively fuses features at different spatial and temporal positions, and avoids error-prone optical flow estimation. Besides, we further exploit feature refinement within a single frame and propose a novel memory-augmented refinement (MAR) module to tackle difficult predictions among semantic boundaries. Specifically, MAR can store the boundary features and prototypes extracted from the training samples, which together form the task-specific memory, and then use them to refine the features during inference. Essentially, MAR can move the hard features closer to the most likely category and thus make them more discriminative. We conduct extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid, and the results show that our proposed methods significantly outperform previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Optical flow estimation methods that work on packets of events trade off speed for accuracy, while event-by-event (incremental) methods have strong assumptions and have not been tested on common benchmarks that quantify progress in the field. Towards applications on resource-constrained devices, it is important to develop optical flow algorithms that are fast, light-weight and accurate. This work leverages insights from neuroscience, and proposes a novel optical flow estimation scheme based on triplet matching. The experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate its capability to handle complex scenes with comparable results as prior packet-based algorithms. In addition, the proposed method achieves the fastest execution time (> 10 kHz) on standard CPUs as it requires only three events in estimation. We hope that our research opens the door to real-time, incremental motion estimation methods and applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

However, it remains challenging to deploy existing VSR methods to real-world data with complex degradations. On the one hand, there are few well-aligned real-world VSR datasets, especially with large super-resolution scale factors, which limits the development of real-world VSR tasks. On the other hand, alignment algorithms in existing VSR methods perform poorly for real-world videos, leading to unsatisfactory results. As an attempt to address the aforementioned issues, we build a real-world 4 VSR dataset, namely MVSR4$\times$, where low- and high-resolution videos are captured with different focal length lenses of a smartphone, respectively. Moreover, we propose an effective alignment method for real-world VSR, namely EAVSR. EAVSR takes the proposed multi-layer adaptive spatial transform network (MultiAdaSTN) to refine the offsets provided by the pre-trained optical flow estimation network. Experimental results on RealVSR and MVSR4$\times$ datasets show the effectiveness and practicality of our method, and we achieve state-of-the-art performance in real-world VSR task.

But major drops in accuracy occur when moving from synthetic to real scenes. How do we better transfer the knowledge learned from synthetic to real domains? To this end, we propose CLIP-FLow, a semi-supervised iterative pseudo-labeling framework to transfer the pretraining knowledge to the target real domain. We leverage large-scale, unlabeled real data to facilitate transfer learning with the supervision of iteratively updated pseudo-ground truth labels, bridging the domain gap between the synthetic and the real. In addition, we propose a contrastive flow loss on reference features and the warped features by pseudo ground truth flows, to further boost the accurate matching and dampen the mismatching due to motion, occlusion, or noisy pseudo labels. We adopt RAFT as the backbone and obtain an F1-all error of 4.11%, i.e. a 19% error reduction from RAFT (5.10%) and ranking 2$^{nd}$ place at submission on the KITTI 2015 benchmark. Our framework can also be extended to other models, e.g. CRAFT, reducing the F1-all error from 4.79% to 4.66% on KITTI 2015 benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Autonomous vehicles clearly benefit from the ultra-wide Field of View (FoV) offered by 360{\deg} panoramic sensors. However, due to the unique imaging process of panoramic cameras, models designed for pinhole images do not directly generalize satisfactorily to 360{\deg} panoramic images. In this paper, we put forward a novel network framework--PanoFlow, to learn optical flow for panoramic images. To overcome the distortions introduced by equirectangular projection in panoramic transformation, we design a Flow Distortion Augmentation (FDA) method, which contains radial flow distortion (FDA-R) or equirectangular flow distortion (FDA-E). We further look into the definition and properties of cyclic optical flow for panoramic videos, and hereby propose a Cyclic Flow Estimation (CFE) method by leveraging the cyclicity of spherical images to infer 360{\deg} optical flow and converting large displacement to relatively small displacement. PanoFlow is applicable to any existing flow estimation method and benefits from the progress of narrow-FoV flow estimation. In addition, we create and release a synthetic panoramic dataset FlowScape based on CARLA to facilitate training and quantitative analysis. PanoFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public OmniFlowNet and the established FlowScape benchmarks. Our proposed approach reduces the End-Point-Error (EPE) on FlowScape by 27.3%. On OmniFlowNet, PanoFlow achieves a 55.5% error reduction from the best published result. We also qualitatively validate our method via a collection vehicle and a public real-world OmniPhotos dataset, indicating strong potential and robustness for real-world navigation applications.

One of the essential factors in accurately predicting optical flow is to alleviate occlusions between frames. However, it is still a thorny problem for current top-performing optical flow estimation methods due to insufficient local evidence to model occluded areas. In this paper, we propose the Super Kernel Flow Network (SKFlow), a CNN architecture to ameliorate the impacts of occlusions on optical flow estimation. SKFlow benefits from the super kernels which bring enlarged receptive fields to complement the absent matching information and recover the occluded motions. We present efficient super kernel designs by utilizing conical connections and hybrid depth-wise convolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SKFlow on multiple benchmarks, especially in the occluded areas. Without pre-trained backbones on ImageNet and with a modest increase in computation, SKFlow achieves compelling performance and ranks $\textbf{1st}$ among currently published methods on the Sintel benchmark. On the challenging Sintel clean and final passes (test), SKFlow surpasses the best-published result in the unmatched areas ($7.96$ and $12.50$) by $9.09\%$ and $7.92\%$.

In this work, we aim to learn dense discriminative object representations for low-shot category recognition without requiring any category labels. To this end, we propose Deep Object Patch Encodings (DOPE), which can be trained from multiple views of object instances without any category or semantic object part labels. To train DOPE, we assume access to sparse depths, foreground masks and known cameras, to obtain pixel-level correspondences between views of an object, and use this to formulate a self-supervised learning task to learn discriminative object patches. We find that DOPE can directly be used for low-shot classification of novel categories using local-part matching, and is competitive with and outperforms supervised and self-supervised learning baselines.

Most of the existing optical flow estimation methods are based on two consecutive image frames and can only estimate discrete flow at a fixed time interval. Previous work has shown that continuous flow estimation can be achieved by changing the quantities or time intervals of events. However, they are difficult to estimate reliable dense flow , especially in the regions without any triggered events. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based dense and continuous optical flow estimation framework from a single image with event streams, which facilitates the accurate perception of high-speed motion. Specifically, we first propose an event-image fusion and correlation module to effectively exploit the internal motion from two different modalities of data. Then we propose an iterative update network structure with bidirectional training for optical flow prediction. Therefore, our model can estimate reliable dense flow as two-frame-based methods, as well as estimate temporal continuous flow as event-based methods.

Although many works have been designed for low-light enhancement or domain adaptive machine analytics, the former considers less on high-level vision, while the latter neglects the potential of image-level signal adjustment. How to restore underexposed images/videos from the perspective of machine vision has long been overlooked. In this paper, we are the first to propose a learnable illumination enhancement model for high-level vision. Inspired by real camera response functions, we assume that the illumination enhancement function should be a concave curve, and propose to satisfy this concavity through discrete integral. With the intention of adapting illumination from the perspective of machine vision without task-specific annotated data, we design an asymmetric cross-domain self-supervised training strategy. Our model architecture and training designs mutually benefit each other, forming a powerful unsupervised normal-to-low light adaptation framework. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing low-light enhancement and adaptation methods and shows superior generalization on various low-light vision tasks, including classification, detection, action recognition, and optical flow estimation.

However, the existing object detection neural network systems are characterized by a tradeoff between computation time and accuracy, making it essential to optimize such a tradeoff. Fortunately, in many autonomous driving environments, images come in a continuous form, providing an opportunity to use optical flow. In this paper, we improve the performance of an object detection neural network utilizing optical flow estimation. In addition, we propose a Lyapunov optimization framework for time-average performance maximization subject to stability. It adaptively determines whether to use optical flow to suit the dynamic vehicle environment, thereby ensuring the vehicle's queue stability and the time-average maximum performance simultaneously. To verify the key ideas, we conduct numerical experiments with various object detection neural networks and optical flow estimation networks. In addition, we demonstrate the self-configurable stabilized detection with YOLOv3-tiny and FlowNet2-S, which are the real-time object detection network and an optical flow estimation network, respectively. In the demonstration, our proposed framework improves the accuracy by 3.02%, the number of detected objects by 59.6%, and the queue stability for computing capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to their limited payload, these vehicles are highly constrained in processing power, rendering conventional vision-based methods for safe and autonomous navigation incompatible. Recent machine learning developments promise high-performance perception at low latency, while dedicated edge computing hardware has the potential to augment the processing capabilities of these limited devices. In this work, we present NanoFlowNet, a lightweight convolutional neural network for real-time dense optical flow estimation on edge computing hardware. We draw inspiration from recent advances in semantic segmentation for the design of this network. Additionally, we guide the learning of optical flow using motion boundary ground truth data, which improves performance with no impact on latency. Validation results on the MPI-Sintel dataset show the high performance of the proposed network given its constrained architecture. Additionally, we successfully demonstrate the capabilities of NanoFlowNet by deploying it on the ultra-low power GAP8 microprocessor and by applying it to vision-based obstacle avoidance on board a Bitcraze Crazyflie, a 34 g nano quadcopter.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Most previous studies have achieved cooperative multi-task interaction via either pre-defined loss functions or cross-domain prediction. This paper presents a multi-task scheme that achieves mutual assistance by means of our Flow to Depth (F2D), Depth to Flow (D2F), and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). F2D and D2F mechanisms enable multi-scale information integration between optical flow and depth domain based on differentiable shallow nets. A dual-head mechanism is used to predict optical flow for rigid and non-rigid motion based on a divide-and-conquer manner, which significantly improves the optical flow estimation performance. Furthermore, to make the prediction more robust and stable, EMA is used for our multi-task training. Experimental results on KITTI datasets show that our multi-task scheme outperforms other multi-task schemes and provide marked improvements on the prediction results.</p></details> |  | None |

Transformer-based methods show significant performance improvement on semi-supervised VOS. However, existing work faces challenges segmenting visually similar objects in close proximity of each other. In this paper, we propose a novel Bilateral Attention Transformer in Motion-Appearance Neighboring space (BATMAN) for semi-supervised VOS. It captures object motion in the video via a novel optical flow calibration module that fuses the segmentation mask with optical flow estimation to improve within-object optical flow smoothness and reduce noise at object boundaries. This calibrated optical flow is then employed in our novel bilateral attention, which computes the correspondence between the query and reference frames in the neighboring bilateral space considering both motion and appearance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BATMAN architecture by outperforming all existing state-of-the-art on all four popular VOS benchmarks: Youtube-VOS 2019 (85.0%), Youtube-VOS 2018 (85.3%), DAVIS 2017Val/Testdev (86.2%/82.2%), and DAVIS 2016 (92.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2022 (Oral)</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes the first perceptually natural-synthetic omnidirectional benchmark dataset with a 360-degree field of view, FLOW360, with 40 different videos and 4,000 video frames. We conduct comprehensive characteristic analysis and comparisons between our dataset and existing optical flow datasets, which manifest perceptual realism, uniqueness, and diversity. To accommodate the omnidirectional nature, we present a novel Siamese representation Learning framework for Omnidirectional Flow (SLOF). We train our network in a contrastive manner with a hybrid loss function that combines contrastive loss and optical flow loss. Extensive experiments verify the proposed framework's effectiveness and show up to 40% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art approaches.

Although performance measured by average End-Point Error (EPE) has improved over the years, flow estimates are still poorer along motion boundaries (MBs), where the flow is not smooth, as is typically assumed, and where features computed by neural networks are contaminated by multiple motions. To improve flow in the unsupervised settings, we design a framework that detects MBs by analyzing visual changes along boundary candidates and replaces motions close to detections with motions farther away. Our proposed algorithm detects boundaries more accurately than a baseline method with the same inputs and can improve estimates from any flow predictor without additional training.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we aim to explore a more generalized kind of video frame interpolation, that at an arbitrary time-step. To this end, we consider processing different time-steps with adaptively generated convolutional kernels in a unified way with the help of meta-learning. Specifically, we develop a dual meta-learned frame interpolation framework to synthesize intermediate frames with the guidance of context information and optical flow as well as taking the time-step as side information. First, a content-aware meta-learned flow refinement module is built to improve the accuracy of the optical flow estimation based on the down-sampled version of the input frames. Second, with the refined optical flow and the time-step as the input, a motion-aware meta-learned frame interpolation module generates the convolutional kernels for every pixel used in the convolution operations on the feature map of the coarse warped version of the input frames to generate the predicted frame. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, as well as ablation studies, demonstrate that, via introducing meta-learning in our framework in such a well-designed way, our method not only achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art frame interpolation approaches but also owns an extended capacity to support the interpolation at an arbitrary time-step.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the distortions of panoramic representations when applying convolutional neural networks, we propose a novel multi-projection fusion framework that fuses the optical flow predicted by the models trained using different projection methods. It learns to combine the complementary information in the optical flow results under different projections. We also build the first large-scale panoramic optical flow dataset to support the training of neural networks and the evaluation of panoramic optical flow estimation methods.

Even though wider temporal context is freely available, prior efforts to take this into account have yielded only small gains over 2-frame methods. In this paper, we revisit Sand and Teller's "particle video" approach, and study pixel tracking as a long-range motion estimation problem, where every pixel is described with a trajectory that locates it in multiple future frames. We re-build this classic approach using components that drive the current state-of-the-art in flow and object tracking, such as dense cost maps, iterative optimization, and learned appearance updates. We train our models using long-range amodal point trajectories mined from existing optical flow data that we synthetically augment with multi-frame occlusions. We test our approach in trajectory estimation benchmarks and in keypoint label propagation tasks, and compare favorably against state-of-the-art optical flow and feature tracking methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, one of the currently most successful approaches -- RAFT -- hardly exploits such concepts. In this work, we show that multi-scale ideas are still valuable. More precisely, using RAFT as a baseline, we propose a novel multi-scale neural network that combines several hierarchical concepts within a single estimation framework. These concepts include (i) a partially shared coarse-to-fine architecture, (ii) multi-scale features, (iii) a hierarchical cost volume and (iv) a multi-scale multi-iteration loss. Experiments on MPI Sintel and KITTI clearly demonstrate the benefits of our approach. They show not only substantial improvements compared to RAFT, but also state-of-the-art results -- in particular in non-occluded regions.

Following recent image-based deep-learning achievements, optical flow estimation methods for event cameras have rushed to combine those image-based methods with event data. However, it requires several adaptations (data conversion, loss function, etc.) as they have very different properties. We develop a principled method to extend the Contrast Maximization framework to estimate optical flow from events alone. We investigate key elements: how to design the objective function to prevent overfitting, how to warp events to deal better with occlusions, and how to improve convergence with multi-scale raw events. With these key elements, our method ranks first among unsupervised methods on the MVSEC benchmark, and is competitive on the DSEC benchmark. Moreover, our method allows us to expose the issues of the ground truth flow in those benchmarks, and produces remarkable results when it is transferred to unsupervised learning settings.

In most cases, these models outperform many modern flow estimation methods. In view of this, we propose an effective implementation design for an edge-preserving $L^1$ regularization approach to optical flow. The mathematical well-posedness of our proposed model is studied in the space of functions of bounded variations $BV(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^2)$. The implementation scheme is designed in multiple steps. The flow field is computed using the robust Chambolle-Pock primal-dual algorithm. Motivated by the recent studies of Castro and Donoho we extend the heuristic of iterated median filtering to our flow estimation. Further, to refine the flow edges we use the weighted median filter established by Li and Osher as a post-processing step. Our experiments on the Middlebury dataset show that the proposed method achieves the best average angular and end-point errors compared to some of the state-of-the-art Horn and Schunck based variational methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To alleviate this, the state-of-the-art framework RAFT gradually improves its prediction quality by using a large number of iterative refinements, achieving remarkable performance but introducing linearly increasing inference time. To enable both high accuracy and efficiency, we completely revamp the dominant flow regression pipeline by reformulating optical flow as a global matching problem, which identifies the correspondences by directly comparing feature similarities. Specifically, we propose a GMFlow framework, which consists of three main components: a customized Transformer for feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for global feature matching, and a self-attention layer for flow propagation. We further introduce a refinement step that reuses GMFlow at higher feature resolution for residual flow prediction. Our new framework outperforms 31-refinements RAFT on the challenging Sintel benchmark, while using only one refinement and running faster, suggesting a new paradigm for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.

In this work, we introduce the COMBO deep network that explicitly exploits the brightness constancy (BC) model used in traditional methods. Since BC is an approximate physical model violated in several situations, we propose to train a physically-constrained network complemented with a data-driven network. We introduce a unique and meaningful flow decomposition between the physical prior and the data-driven complement, including an uncertainty quantification of the BC model. We derive a joint training scheme for learning the different components of the decomposition ensuring an optimal cooperation, in a supervised but also in a semi-supervised context. Experiments show that COMBO can improve performances over state-of-the-art supervised networks, e.g. RAFT, reaching state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. We highlight how COMBO can leverage the BC model and adapt to its limitations. Finally, we show that our semi-supervised method can significantly simplify the training procedure.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it may suffer from a problem called event collapse, which is an undesired solution where events are warped into too few pixels. As prior works have largely ignored the issue or proposed workarounds, it is imperative to analyze this phenomenon in detail. Our work demonstrates event collapse in its simplest form and proposes collapse metrics by using first principles of space-time deformation based on differential geometry and physics. We experimentally show on publicly available datasets that the proposed metrics mitigate event collapse and do not harm well-posed warps. To the best of our knowledge, regularizers based on the proposed metrics are the only effective solution against event collapse in the experimental settings considered, compared with other methods. We hope that this work inspires further research to tackle more complex warp models.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

However, due to the natural difference between the tasks, the architectures designed for image classification may be sub-optimal for flow estimation. To address this issue, we propose a neural architecture search method named FlowNAS to automatically find the better encoder architecture for flow estimation task. We first design a suitable search space including various convolutional operators and construct a weight-sharing super-network for efficiently evaluating the candidate architectures. Then, for better training the super-network, we propose Feature Alignment Distillation, which utilizes a well-trained flow estimator to guide the training of super-network. Finally, a resource-constrained evolutionary algorithm is exploited to find an optimal architecture (i.e., sub-network). Experimental results show that the discovered architecture with the weights inherited from the super-network achieves 4.67\% F1-all error on KITTI, an 8.4\% reduction of RAFT baseline, surpassing state-of-the-art handcrafted models GMA and AGFlow, while reducing the model complexity and latency.

Although recent hairstyle transfer models can reflect the delicate features of hairstyles, they still have two major limitations. First, the existing methods fail to transfer hairstyles when a source and a target image have different poses (e.g., viewing direction or face size), which is prevalent in the real world. Also, the previous models generate unrealistic images when there is a non-trivial amount of regions in the source image occluded by its original hair. When modifying long hair to short hair, shoulders or backgrounds occluded by the long hair need to be inpainted. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for pose-invariant hairstyle transfer, HairFIT. Our model consists of two stages: 1) flow-based hair alignment and 2) hair synthesis. In the hair alignment stage, we leverage a keypoint-based optical flow estimator to align a target hairstyle with a source pose. Then, we generate a final hairstyle-transferred image in the hair synthesis stage based on Semantic-region-aware Inpainting Mask (SIM) estimator. Our SIM estimator divides the occluded regions in the source image into different semantic regions to reflect their distinct features during the inpainting. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations using multi-view datasets, K-hairstyle and VoxCeleb. The results indicate that HairFIT achieves a state-of-the-art performance by successfully transferring hairstyles between images of different poses, which has never been achieved before.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2021 Oral Presentation</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose an unsupervised flow-aligned sequence-to-sequence model (S2SVR) to address this problem. On the one hand, the sequence-to-sequence model, which has proven capable of sequence modeling in the field of natural language processing, is explored for the first time in VR. Optimized serialization modeling shows potential in capturing long-range dependencies among frames. On the other hand, we equip the sequence-to-sequence model with an unsupervised optical flow estimator to maximize its potential. The flow estimator is trained with our proposed unsupervised distillation loss, which can alleviate the data discrepancy and inaccurate degraded optical flow issues of previous flow-based methods. With reliable optical flow, we can establish accurate correspondence among multiple frames, narrowing the domain difference between 1D language and 2D misaligned frames and improving the potential of the sequence-to-sequence model.

The possibility to physically attack a basic component of automotive systems is a reason for serious concerns. In this paper, we analyze the cause of the problem and show that the lack of robustness is rooted in the classical aperture problem of optical flow estimation in combination with bad choices in the details of the network architecture. We show how these mistakes can be rectified in order to make optical flow networks robust to physical patch-based attacks. Additionally, we take a look at global white-box attacks in the scope of optical flow. We find that targeted white-box attacks can be crafted to bias flow estimation models towards any desired output, but this requires access to the input images and model weights. However, in the case of universal attacks, we find that optical flow networks are robust.

This paper introduces novel and effective consistency strategies for optical flow estimation, a problem where labels from real-world data are very challenging to derive. More specifically, we propose occlusion consistency and zero forcing in the forms of self-supervised learning and transformation consistency in the form of semi-supervised learning. We apply these consistency techniques in a way that the network model learns to describe pixel-level motions better while requiring no additional annotations. We demonstrate that our consistency strategies applied to a strong baseline network model using the original datasets and labels provide further improvements, attaining the state-of-the-art results on the KITTI-2015 scene flow benchmark in the non-stereo category.

| **[Deep Equilibrium Optical Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08442v1)** | 2022-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) optical flow models use finite-step recurrent update operations to emulate traditional algorithms by encouraging iterative refinements toward a stable flow estimation. However, these RNNs impose large computation and memory overheads, and are not directly trained to model such stable estimation. They can converge poorly and thereby suffer from performance degradation. To combat these drawbacks, we propose deep equilibrium (DEQ) flow estimators, an approach that directly solves for the flow as the infinite-level fixed point of an implicit layer (using any black-box solver), and differentiates through this fixed point analytically (thus requiring $O(1)$ training memory). This implicit-depth approach is not predicated on any specific model, and thus can be applied to a wide range of SOTA flow estimation model designs. The use of these DEQ flow estimators allows us to compute the flow faster using, e.g., fixed-point reuse and inexact gradients, consumes $4\sim6\times$ times less training memory than the recurrent counterpart, and achieves better results with the same computation budget. In addition, we propose a novel, sparse fixed-point correction scheme to stabilize our DEQ flow estimators, which addresses a longstanding challenge for DEQ models in general. We test our approach in various realistic settings and show that it improves SOTA methods on Sintel and KITTI datasets with substantially better computational and memory efficiency.</p></details> | CVPR 2022 | None |

This paper presents the usage of multiple video feeds for the generation of HSTR video as an extension of reference based super resolution (RefSR). One feed captures video at high spatial resolution with low frame rate (HSLF) while the other captures low spatial resolution and high frame rate (LSHF) video simultaneously for the same scene. The main purpose is to create an HSTR video from the fusion of HSLF and LSHF videos. In this paper we propose an end-to-end trainable deep network that performs optical flow estimation and frame reconstruction by combining inputs from both video feeds. The proposed architecture provides significant improvement over existing video frame interpolation and RefSR techniques in terms of objective PSNR and SSIM metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

The model couples the following two components: (1) the vector representations of local contents of images and (2) the matrix representations of local pixel displacements caused by the relative motions between the agent and the objects in the 3D scene. When the image frame undergoes changes due to local pixel displacements, the vectors are multiplied by the matrices that represent the local displacements. Thus the vector representation is equivariant as it varies according to the local displacements. Our experiments show that our model can learn Gabor-like filter pairs of quadrature phases. The profiles of the learned filters match those of simple cells in Macaque V1. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model can learn to infer local motions in either a supervised or unsupervised manner.

Recently, many deep learning methods have shown great success in providing promising solutions to many event-based problems, such as optical flow estimation.

Another line of research that utilizes Spiking Neural Network suffers from training issues for deeper architecture.To address these points, a novel input representation is proposed that captures the events' temporal distribution for signal enhancement. Moreover, we introduce a spatio-temporal recurrent encoding-decoding neural network architecture for event-based optical flow estimation, which utilizes Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units to extract feature maps from a series of event images. Besides, our architecture allows some traditional frame-based core modules, such as correlation layer and iterative residual refine scheme, to be incorporated.
