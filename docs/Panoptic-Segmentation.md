| **[GVCCS: A Dataset for Contrail Identification and Tracking on Visible Whole Sky Camera Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18330v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Advancing Visual Large Language Model for Multi-granular Versatile Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16213v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision, encompassing a diverse set of subtasks that can be systematically categorized into four distinct groups based on two dimensions: prediction type and instruction type. Notably, existing researches often focus solely on a limited subset of these potential combinations, which constrains their applicability and versatility across various contexts. In response to this challenge, we present MVP-LM, a Multi-granular and Versatile Perception framework incorporating Visual Large Language Model. Our framework is designed to integrate both word-based and sentence-based perception tasks alongside box and mask predictions within a single architecture. MVP-LM features an innovative multi-granularity decoder in conjunction with a CoT-inspired dataset unification strategy, enabling seamless supervised fine-tuning across a wide spectrum of tasks, including but not limited to panoptic segmentation, detection, grounding, and referring expression segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a query enhancement strategy aimed at harnessing the decoding and generative capabilities inherent in VLLMs. Extensive experiments conducted across a range of benchmarks in both word-based and sentence-based perception tasks substantiate the efficacy of our framework.

| **[ObjectGS: Object-aware Scene Reconstruction and Scene Understanding via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15454v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting is renowned for its high-fidelity reconstructions and real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding. Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs, enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks, but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene editing.

| **[Leveraging Pathology Foundation Models for Panoptic Segmentation of Melanoma in H&E Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13974v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps. The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability. Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational pathology workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MIUA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Spatial Frequency Modulation for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11893v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

| **[DEARLi: Decoupled Enhancement of Recognition and Localization for Semi-supervised Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10118v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images.

| **[LOSC: LiDAR Open-voc Segmentation Consolidator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07605v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically, image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method, called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant margins.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SemRaFiner: Panoptic Segmentation in Sparse and Noisy Radar Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06906v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> | None |
| **[CAVIS: Context-Aware Video Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03010v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Context-Aware Video Instance Segmentation (CAVIS), a novel framework designed to enhance instance association by integrating contextual information adjacent to each object. To efficiently extract and leverage this information, we propose the Context-Aware Instance Tracker (CAIT), which merges contextual data surrounding the instances with the core instance features to improve tracking accuracy. Additionally, we design the Prototypical Cross-frame Contrastive (PCC) loss, which ensures consistency in object-level features across frames, thereby significantly enhancing matching accuracy. CAVIS demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on all benchmark datasets in video instance segmentation (VIS) and video panoptic segmentation (VPS). Notably, our method excels on the OVIS dataset, known for its particularly challenging videos.

| **[OpenWorldSAM: Extending SAM2 for Universal Image Segmentation with Language Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05427v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks. ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances. iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities, generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[All in One: Visual-Description-Guided Unified Point Cloud Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05211v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding, but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation. We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/VDG-Uni3DSeg.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/Hanzy1996/VDG-Uni3DSeg) |
| **[Mr. DETR++: Instructive Multi-Route Training for Detection Transformers with Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10028v4)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods enhance the training of detection transformers by incorporating an auxiliary one-to-many assignment. In this work, we treat the model as a multi-task framework, simultaneously performing one-to-one and one-to-many predictions. We investigate the roles of each component in the transformer decoder across these two training targets, including self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward network. Our empirical results demonstrate that any independent component in the decoder can effectively learn both targets simultaneously, even when other components are shared. This finding leads us to propose a multi-route training mechanism, featuring a primary route for one-to-one prediction and two auxiliary training routes for one-to-many prediction. We propose a novel instructive self-attention mechanism, integrated into the first auxiliary route, which dynamically and flexibly guides object queries for one-to-many prediction. For the second auxiliary route, we introduce a route-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to facilitate knowledge sharing while mitigating potential conflicts between routes. Additionally, we apply an MoE to low-scale features in the encoder, optimizing the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The auxiliary routes are discarded during inference. We conduct extensive experiments across various object detection baselines, achieving consistent improvements as demonstrated in Fig. 1. Our method is highly flexible and can be readily adapted to other tasks. To demonstrate its versatility, we conduct experiments on both instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness.

| **[PanSt3R: Multi-view Consistent Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21348v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images. Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions. We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS. Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[HieraSurg: Hierarchy-Aware Diffusion Model for Surgical Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21287v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation. Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame, HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for practical surgical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Co-Seg++: Mutual Prompt-Guided Collaborative Learning for Versatile Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17159v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances.

In this survey, we present a holistic review of recent advances in VSP, covering a wide array of vision tasks, including Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS), Video Instance Segmentation (VIS), Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), as well as Video Tracking and Segmentation (VTS), and Open-Vocabulary Video Segmentation (OVVS). We systematically analyze the evolution from traditional hand-crafted features to modern deep learning paradigms -- spanning from fully convolutional networks to the latest transformer-based architectures -- and assess their effectiveness in capturing both local and global temporal contexts. Furthermore, our review critically discusses the technical challenges, ranging from maintaining temporal consistency to handling complex scene dynamics, and offers a comprehensive comparative study of datasets and evaluation metrics that have shaped current benchmarking standards. By distilling the key contributions and shortcomings of state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey highlights emerging trends and prospective research directions that promise to further elevate the robustness and adaptability of VSP in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Open-Set LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation Guided by Uncertainty-Aware Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13265v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Missing Point in Vision Transformers for Universal Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19795v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4 mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

Towards a Harmonized Multi-modal 3D Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18956v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation often struggles with the inherent sparsity of data from LiDAR sensors, which makes it challenging to accurately recognize distant or small objects. Recently, a few studies have sought to overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images, leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks.

| **[OpenSeg-R: Improving Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16974v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability.

| **[Cues3D: Unleashing the Power of Sole NeRF for Consistent and Unique Instances in Open-Vocabulary 3D Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00378v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D panoptic segmentation has recently emerged as a significant trend. Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation with geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without high-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain consistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have utilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view consensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that relies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's implicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry, enabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision. We propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF, initialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are corrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance disambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure globally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain highly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a balanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and semantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods and competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing them when using additional 3D point clouds.

| **[Real-Time Image Segmentation via Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10413v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision and has drawn a lot of attention due to its vast applications in image understanding and autonomous driving. However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require numerous trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high-resolution representation CNNs efficiently by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features but also finds the proper location for placing the multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objectives (e.g., latency and mIoU) and is capable of finding architectures on the Pareto frontier with an arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of models via the Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searches for the best hybrid combination of light-weight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuses them to high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyCTAS outperforms previous methods in both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation tasks.

Automated computer vision methods typically require extensively annotated datasets, which are often unavailable in decentralized supply chains. We address this challenge by evaluating the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate dense panoptic segmentation masks from sparse annotations. These dense predictions are then used to train a supervised panoptic segmentation model. Focusing on banana surface defects (bruises and scars), we validate our approach using 476 field images annotated with 1440 defects. While SAM-generated masks generally align with human annotations, substantially reducing annotation effort, we explicitly identify failure cases associated with specific defect sizes and shapes. Despite these limitations, our approach offers practical estimates of defect number and relative size from panoptic masks, underscoring the potential and current boundaries of foundation models for defect quantification in low-data agricultural scenarios.

Specifically, our approach, namely NCLR, focuses on 2D-3D neural calibration, a novel pretext task that estimates the rigid pose aligning camera and LiDAR coordinate systems. First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching. Second, we identify the overlapping area between the image and point cloud with the fused features. Third, we establish dense 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the rigid pose. The framework not only learns fine-grained matching from points to pixels but also achieves alignment of the image and point cloud at a holistic level, understanding their relative pose. We demonstrate the efficacy of NCLR by applying the pre-trained backbone to downstream tasks, such as LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets illustrate the superiority of NCLR over existing self-supervised methods. The results confirm that joint learning from different modalities significantly enhances the network's understanding abilities and effectiveness of learned representation.

The integration of machine learning (ML) into AV perception systems highlights the need for locally labelled datasets to develop and test algorithms in specific environments. To address this, we introduce SydneyScapes - a dataset tailored for computer vision tasks of image semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. This dataset, collected from Sydney and surrounding cities in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, consists of 756 images with high-quality pixel-level annotations. It is designed to assist AV industry and researchers by providing annotated data and tools for algorithm development, testing, and deployment in the Australian context.

| **[Prior2Former -- Evidential Modeling of Mask Transformers for Assumption-Free Open-World Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04841v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In panoptic segmentation, individual instances must be separated within semantic classes. As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where reliability in unseen scenarios is essential. We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of P2F. It achieves the highest ranking in the OoDIS anomaly instance benchmark among methods not using OOD data in any way.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enforcing View-Consistency in Class-Agnostic 3D Segmentation Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09928v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance Fields have become a powerful tool for modeling 3D scenes from multiple images. However, they remain difficult to segment into semantically meaningful regions. Some methods work well using 2D semantic masks, but they generalize poorly to class-agnostic segmentations. More recent methods circumvent this issue by using contrastive learning to optimize a high-dimensional 3D feature field instead. However, recovering a segmentation then requires clustering and fine-tuning the associated hyperparameters. In contrast, we aim to identify the necessary changes in segmentation field methods to directly learn a segmentation field while being robust to inconsistent class-agnostic masks, successfully decomposing the scene into a set of objects of any class. By introducing an additional spatial regularization term and restricting the field to a limited number of competing object slots against which masks are matched, a meaningful object representation emerges that best explains the 2D supervision. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to generate 3D panoptic segmentations on complex scenes, and extract high-quality 3D assets from radiance fields that can then be used in virtual 3D environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPRW...</summary><p>CVPRW 2025, presented at the 4th Workshop on Open-World 3D Scene Understanding with Foundation Models.

In contrast to prior work on unsupervised panoptic scene understanding, we eliminate the need for object-centric training data, enabling the unsupervised understanding of complex scenes. To that end, we present the first unsupervised panoptic method that directly trains on scene-centric imagery. In particular, we propose an approach to obtain high-resolution panoptic pseudo labels on complex scene-centric data, combining visual representations, depth, and motion cues. Utilizing both pseudo-label training and a panoptic self-training strategy yields a novel approach that accurately predicts panoptic segmentation of complex scenes without requiring any human annotations.

However, the primary challenge in advancing research and developing generalized, versatile methods for spatio-temporal scene understanding in Lidar lies in the scarcity of datasets that provide the necessary diversity and scale of annotations.To overcome these challenges, we propose SAL-4D (Segment Anything in Lidar--4D), a method that utilizes multi-modal robotic sensor setups as a bridge to distill recent developments in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) in conjunction with off-the-shelf Vision-Language foundation models to Lidar. We utilize VOS models to pseudo-label tracklets in short video sequences, annotate these tracklets with sequence-level CLIP tokens, and lift them to the 4D Lidar space using calibrated multi-modal sensory setups to distill them to our SAL-4D model. Due to temporal consistent predictions, we outperform prior art in 3D Zero-Shot Lidar Panoptic Segmentation (LPS) over $5$ PQ, and unlock Zero-Shot 4D-LPS.</p></details> |  | None |

However, previous methods cannot distinguish 3D instance-level information, which usually predicts a heatmap between the scene feature and text query. In this paper, we propose PanoGS, a novel and effective 3D panoptic open vocabulary scene understanding approach. Technically, to learn accurate 3D language features that can scale to large indoor scenarios, we adopt the pyramid tri-plane to model the latent continuous parametric feature space and use a 3D feature decoder to regress the multi-view fused 2D feature cloud. Besides, we propose language-guided graph cuts that synergistically leverage reconstructed geometry and learned language cues to group 3D Gaussian primitives into a set of super-primitives. To obtain 3D consistent instance, we perform graph clustering based segmentation with SAM-guided edge affinity computation between different super-primitives. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets show better or more competitive performance on 3D panoptic open vocabulary scene understanding.

While synthetic datasets offer an alternative, existing options exhibit task-specific limitations, unrealistic scene compositions, and rendering artifacts that compromise real-world applicability. We introduce ClaraVid, a synthetic aerial dataset specifically designed to overcome these limitations. Comprising 16,917 high-resolution images captured at 4032x3024 from multiple viewpoints across diverse landscapes, ClaraVid provides dense depth maps, panoptic segmentation, sparse point clouds, and dynamic object masks, while mitigating common rendering artifacts. To further advance neural reconstruction, we introduce the Delentropic Scene Profile (DSP), a novel complexity metric derived from differential entropy analysis, designed to quantitatively assess scene difficulty and inform reconstruction tasks. Utilizing DSP, we systematically benchmark neural reconstruction methods, uncovering a consistent, measurable correlation between scene complexity and reconstruction accuracy. Empirical results indicate that higher delentropy strongly correlates with increased reconstruction errors, validating DSP as a reliable complexity prior.

Although some datasets encompass variations in weather and lighting, bad weather scenarios do not appear often. Rainfall can significantly impair sensor functionality, introducing noise and reflections in LiDAR and camera data and reducing the system's capabilities for reliable environmental perception and safe navigation. We introduce the Panoptic-CUDAL dataset, a novel dataset purpose-built for panoptic segmentation in rural areas subject to rain. By recording high-resolution LiDAR, camera, and pose data, Panoptic-CUDAL offers a diverse, information-rich dataset in a challenging scenario.

However, such methods primarily emphasize broadening the receptive field in textureless areas, while neglecting deformation instability caused by easily overlooked edge-skipping, potentially leading to matching distortions. To address this, we propose SED-MVS, which adopts panoptic segmentation and multi-trajectory diffusion strategy for segmentation-driven and edge-aligned patch deformation. Specifically, to prevent unanticipated edge-skipping, we first employ SAM2 for panoptic segmentation as depth-edge guidance to guide patch deformation, followed by multi-trajectory diffusion strategy to ensure patches are comprehensively aligned with depth edges. Moreover, to avoid potential inaccuracy of random initialization, we combine both sparse points from LoFTR and monocular depth map from DepthAnything V2 to restore reliable and realistic depth map for initialization and supervised guidance. Finally, we integrate segmentation image with monocular depth map to exploit inter-instance occlusion relationship, then further regard them as occlusion map to implement two distinct edge constraint, thereby facilitating occlusion-aware patch deformation. Extensive results on ETH3D, Tanks & Temples, BlendedMVS and Strecha datasets validate the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capability of our proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

While state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on end-to-end deep learning architectures and extensive manual annotations of instances, the significant cost and time investment required for labeling large-scale point cloud datasets remains a major bottleneck in this field. In this work, we demonstrate that competitive panoptic segmentation can be achieved using only semantic labels, with instances predicted without any training or annotations. Our method achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art supervised methods on standard benchmarks including SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and outperforms every publicly available method on SemanticKITTI as a drop-in instance head replacement, while running in real-time on a single-threaded CPU and requiring no instance labels.

Robots can help to automate this process. To do so, they need to be able to perceive the surrounding environment to identify target objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address the problem of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of apple orchards on 3D data from different sensors. Our approach is able to simultaneously provide semantic segmentation, instance segmentation of trunks and fruits, and instance segmentation of plants (a single trunk with its fruits). This allows us to identify relevant information such as individual plants, fruits, and trunks, and capture the relationship among them, such as precisely estimate the number of fruits associated to each tree in an orchard. Additionally, to efficiently evaluate our approach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, we provide a dataset designed specifically for this task. Our dataset is recorded in Bonn in a real apple orchard with a variety of sensors, spanning from a terrestrial laser scanner to a RGB-D camera mounted on different robotic platforms. The experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in 3D panoptic segmentation in the agricultural domain, while also providing full hierarchical panoptic segmentation. Our dataset has been made publicly available at https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/hops/.

Despite considerable progress in removing hand-crafted components and simplifying the architecture with transformers, multi-scale feature maps and pyramid designs remain a key factor for their empirical success. In this paper, we show that shifting the multiscale inductive bias into the attention mechanism can work well, resulting in a plain detector `SimPLR' whose backbone and detection head are both non-hierarchical and operate on single-scale features. We find through our experiments that SimPLR with scale-aware attention is plain and simple architecture, yet competitive with multi-scale vision transformer alternatives. Compared to the multi-scale and single-scale state-of-the-art, our model scales better with bigger capacity (self-supervised) models and more pre-training data, allowing us to report a consistently better accuracy and faster runtime for object detection, instance segmentation, as well as panoptic segmentation.

This provides robots with a spatio-temporal understanding of the environment, an essential attribute for their operation in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for panoptic tracking that simultaneously captures general semantic information and instance-specific appearance and motion features. Unlike existing methods that overlook dynamic scene attributes, our approach leverages both appearance and motion cues through dedicated network heads. These interconnected heads employ multi-scale deformable convolutions that reason about scene motion offsets with semantic context and motion-enhanced appearance features to learn tracking embeddings. Furthermore, we introduce a novel two-step fusion module that integrates the outputs from both heads by first matching instances from the current time step with propagated instances from previous time steps and subsequently refines associations using motion-enhanced appearance embeddings, improving robustness in challenging scenarios. Extensive evaluations of our proposed \netname model on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoptic tracking accuracy, surpassing prior methods in maintaining object identities over time.

To address this challenge, we propose MaskAttn-UNet, a novel segmentation framework that enhances the traditional U-Net architecture via a mask attention mechanism. Our model selectively emphasizes important regions while suppressing irrelevant backgrounds, thereby improving segmentation accuracy in cluttered and complex scenes. Unlike conventional U-Net variants, MaskAttn-UNet effectively balances local feature extraction with broader contextual awareness, making it particularly well-suited for low-resolution inputs. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets with input images rescaled to 128x128 and demonstrate competitive performance across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks. Our results show that MaskAttn-UNet achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods at significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models, making it an efficient and scalable solution for low-resolution segmentation in resource-constrained scenarios.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Submission | None |
| **[DiffEGG: Diffusion-Driven Edge Generation as a Pixel-Annotation-Free Alternative for Instance Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07982v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise panoptic segmentation relies on pixel-wise instance annotations, but obtaining such datasets is costly. Unsupervised instance segmentation (UIS) eliminates annotation requirements but struggles with adjacent instance merging and single-instance fragmentation, largely due to the limitations of DINO-based backbones which lack strong instance separation cues. Weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation (WPS) reduces annotation costs using sparse labels (e.g., points, boxes), yet these annotations remain expensive and introduce human bias and boundary errors. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEGG (Diffusion-Driven EdGe Generation), a fully annotation-free method that extracts instance-aware features from pretrained diffusion models to generate precise instance edge maps. Unlike DINO-based UIS methods, diffusion models inherently capture fine-grained, instance-aware features, enabling more precise boundary delineation. For WPS, DiffEGG eliminates annotation costs and human bias by operating without any form of manual supervision, addressing the key limitations of prior best methods. Additionally, we introduce RIP, a post-processing technique that fuses DiffEGG's edge maps with segmentation masks in a task-agnostic manner. RIP allows DiffEGG to be seamlessly integrated into various segmentation frameworks. When applied to UIS, DiffEGG and RIP achieve an average $+4.4\text{ AP}$ improvement over prior best UIS methods. When combined with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSS), DiffEGG enables WPS without instance annotations, outperforming prior best point-supervised WPS methods by $+1.7\text{ PQ}$. These results demonstrate that DiffEGG's edge maps serve as a cost-effective, annotation-free alternative to instance annotations, significantly improving segmentation without human intervention.

To this end, we introduce a tightly coupled self-supervised depth estimation predictor that explicitly uses information from the panoptic path for depth prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a panoptic-guided motion masking method to improve depth estimation without relying on video panoptic segmentation annotations.

Current datasets fall short in scale, realism and do not capture the multimodal nature of OR scenes, limiting progress in OR modeling. To this end, we introduce MM-OR, a realistic and large-scale multimodal spatiotemporal OR dataset, and the first dataset to enable multimodal scene graph generation.

| **[Label-Efficient LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02372v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A main bottleneck of learning-based robotic scene understanding methods is the heavy reliance on extensive annotated training data, which often limits their generalization ability. In LiDAR panoptic segmentation, this challenge becomes even more pronounced due to the need to simultaneously address both semantic and instance segmentation from complex, high-dimensional point cloud data. In this work, we address the challenge of LiDAR panoptic segmentation with very few labeled samples by leveraging recent advances in label-efficient vision panoptic segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel method, Limited-Label LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation (L3PS), which requires only a minimal amount of labeled data. Our approach first utilizes a label-efficient 2D network to generate panoptic pseudo-labels from a small set of annotated images, which are subsequently projected onto point clouds. We then introduce a novel 3D refinement module that capitalizes on the geometric properties of point clouds. By incorporating clustering techniques, sequential scan accumulation, and ground point separation, this module significantly enhances the accuracy of the pseudo-labels, improving segmentation quality by up to +10.6 PQ and +7.9 mIoU. We demonstrate that these refined pseudo-labels can be used to effectively train off-the-shelf LiDAR segmentation networks. Through extensive experiments, we show that L3PS not only outperforms existing methods but also substantially reduces the annotation burden.

| **[Improving vision-language alignment with graph spiking hybrid Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19069v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To bridge the semantic gap between vision and language (VL), it is necessary to develop a good alignment strategy, which includes handling semantic diversity, abstract representation of visual information, and generalization ability of models. Recent works use detector-based bounding boxes or patches with regular partitions to represent visual semantics. While current paradigms have made strides, they are still insufficient for fully capturing the nuanced contextual relations among various objects. This paper proposes a comprehensive visual semantic representation module, necessitating the utilization of panoptic segmentation to generate coherent fine-grained semantic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel Graph Spiking Hybrid Network (GSHN) that integrates the complementary advantages of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to encode visual semantic information. Intriguingly, the model not only encodes the discrete and continuous latent variables of instances but also adeptly captures both local and global contextual features, thereby significantly enhancing the richness and diversity of semantic representations. Leveraging the spatiotemporal properties inherent in SNNs, we employ contrastive learning (CL) to enhance the similarity-based representation of embeddings. This strategy alleviates the computational overhead of the model and enriches meaningful visual representations by constructing positive and negative sample pairs. We design an innovative pre-training method, Spiked Text Learning (STL), which uses text features to improve the encoding ability of discrete semantics. Experiments show that the proposed GSHN exhibits promising results on multiple VL downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RMP-SAM: Towards Real-Time Multi-Purpose Segment Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10228v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent segmentation methods, which adopt large-scale data training and transformer architecture, aim to create one foundation model that can perform multiple tasks. However, most of these methods rely on heavy encoder and decoder frameworks, hindering their performance in real-time scenarios. To explore real-time segmentation, recent advancements primarily focus on semantic segmentation within specific environments, such as autonomous driving. However, they often overlook the generalization ability of these models across diverse scenarios. Therefore, to fill this gap, this work explores a novel real-time segmentation setting called real-time multi-purpose segmentation. It contains three fundamental sub-tasks: interactive segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and video instance segmentation. Unlike previous methods, which use a specific design for each task, we aim to use only a single end-to-end model to accomplish all these tasks in real-time. To meet real-time requirements and balance multi-task learning, we present a novel dynamic convolution-based method, Real-Time Multi-Purpose SAM (RMP-SAM). It contains an efficient encoder and an efficient decoupled adapter to perform prompt-driven decoding. Moreover, we further explore different training strategies and one new adapter design to boost co-training performance further. We benchmark several strong baselines by extending existing works to support our multi-purpose segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMP-SAM is effective and generalizes well on proposed benchmarks and other specific semantic tasks. Our implementation of RMP-SAM achieves the optimal balance between accuracy and speed for these tasks.Our code and model are available at https://github.com/xushilin1/RAP-SAM/.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR-...</summary><p>ICLR-2025 (oral).

| **[Pointmap Association and Piecewise-Plane Constraint for Consistent and Compact 3D Gaussian Segmentation Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16303v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving a consistent and compact 3D segmentation field is crucial for maintaining semantic coherence across views and accurately representing scene structures. Previous 3D scene segmentation methods rely on video segmentation models to address inconsistencies across views, but the absence of spatial information often leads to object misassociation when object temporarily disappear and reappear. Furthermore, in the process of 3D scene reconstruction, segmentation and optimization are often treated as separate tasks. As a result, optimization typically lacks awareness of semantic category information, which can result in floaters with ambiguous segmentation. To address these challenges, we introduce CCGS, a method designed to achieve both view consistent 2D segmentation and a compact 3D Gaussian segmentation field. CCGS incorporates pointmap association and a piecewise-plane constraint. First, we establish pixel correspondence between adjacent images by minimizing the Euclidean distance between their pointmaps. We then redefine object mask overlap accordingly. The Hungarian algorithm is employed to optimize mask association by minimizing the total matching cost, while allowing for partial matches. To further enhance compactness, the piecewise-plane constraint restricts point displacement within local planes during optimization, thereby preserving structural integrity. Experimental results on ScanNet and Replica datasets demonstrate that CCGS outperforms existing methods in both 2D panoptic segmentation and 3D Gaussian segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Panoptic Diffusion Models: co-generation of images and segmentation maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02929v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in text-guided and image-conditioned image generation. However, existing diffusion models cannot simultaneously generate an image and a panoptic segmentation of objects and stuff from the prompt. Incorporating an inherent understanding of shapes and scene layouts can improve the creativity and realism of diffusion models. To address this limitation, we present Panoptic Diffusion Model (PDM), the first model designed to generate both images and panoptic segmentation maps concurrently. PDM bridges the gap between image and text by constructing segmentation layouts that provide detailed, built-in guidance throughout the generation process. This ensures the inclusion of categories mentioned in text prompts and enriches the diversity of segments within the background. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PDM across two architectures: a unified diffusion transformer and a two-stream transformer with a pretrained backbone. We propose a Multi-Scale Patching mechanism to generate high-resolution segmentation maps. Additionally, when ground-truth maps are available, PDM can function as a text-guided image-to-image generation model. Finally, we propose a novel metric for evaluating the quality of generated maps and show that PDM achieves state-of-the-art results in image generation with implicit scene control.</p></details> |  | None |

The COCONut-PanCap dataset incorporates fine-grained, region-level captions grounded in panoptic segmentation masks, ensuring consistency and improving the detail of generated captions. Through human-edited, densely annotated descriptions, COCONut-PanCap supports improved training of vision-language models (VLMs) for image understanding and generative models for text-to-image tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that COCONut-PanCap significantly boosts performance across understanding and generation tasks, offering complementary benefits to large-scale datasets.

To achieve this, we carefully design an automated annotation pipeline that prompts GPT-4V to generate pixel-aligned, instance-specific captions for individual objects within images, enabling models to learn more granular relationships between objects and their contexts. This approach results in 167,254 detailed captions, with an average of 22.94 words per caption. Building on Pix2Cap-COCO, we introduce a novel task, panoptic segmentation-captioning, which challenges models to recognize instances in an image and provide detailed descriptions for each simultaneously. To benchmark this task, we design a robust baseline based on X-Decoder. The experimental results demonstrate that Pix2Cap-COCO is a particularly challenging dataset, as it requires models to excel in both fine-grained visual understanding and detailed language generation. Furthermore, we leverage Pix2Cap-COCO for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on large multimodal models (LMMs) to enhance their performance. For example, training with Pix2Cap-COCO significantly improves the performance of GPT4RoI, yielding gains in CIDEr +1.4%, ROUGE +0.4%, and SPICE +0.5% on Visual Genome dataset, and strengthens its region understanding ability on the ViP-BENCH, with an overall improvement of +5.1%, including notable increases in recognition accuracy +11.2% and language generation quality +22.2%.</p></details> |  | None |

Using COCO-OLAC, we systematically assess and quantify the impact of occlusion on panoptic segmentation on samples having different levels of occlusion. Comparative experiments with SOTA panoptic models demonstrate that the presence of occlusion significantly affects performance, with higher occlusion levels resulting in notably poorer performance. Additionally, we propose a straightforward yet effective method as an initial attempt to leverage the occlusion annotation using contrastive learning to render a model that learns a more robust representation capturing different severities of occlusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach boosts the performance of the baseline model and achieves SOTA performance on the proposed COCO-OLAC dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Before making a prediction on each test instance, the model is first trained on the same instance using a self-supervised task such as reconstruction. We extend TTT to the streaming setting, where multiple test instances - video frames in our case - arrive in temporal order. Our extension is online TTT: The current model is initialized from the previous model, then trained on the current frame and a small window of frames immediately before. Online TTT significantly outperforms the fixed-model baseline for four tasks, on three real-world datasets. The improvements are more than 2.2x and 1.5x for instance and panoptic segmentation. Surprisingly, online TTT also outperforms its offline variant that accesses strictly more information, training on all frames from the entire test video regardless of temporal order. This finding challenges those in prior work using synthetic videos. We formalize a notion of locality as the advantage of online over offline TTT, and analyze its role with ablations and a theory based on bias-variance trade-off.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website with videos, dataset and code: https://test-time-training.github.io/video</p></details> | [Code Link](https://test-time-training.github.io/video) |

Despite claims of robust generalization, we find that the advancements of previous works are attributed mainly on trained categories, exposing a lack of generalization to novel classes. In this paper, we explore boosting existing models from a data-centric perspective. We propose DreamMask, which systematically explores how to generate training data in the open-vocabulary setting, and how to train the model with both real and synthetic data. For the first part, we propose an automatic data generation pipeline with off-the-shelf models. We propose crucial designs for vocabulary expansion, layout arrangement, data filtering, etc. Equipped with these techniques, our generated data could significantly outperform the manually collected web data. To train the model with generated data, a synthetic-real alignment loss is designed to bridge the representation gap, bringing noticeable improvements across multiple benchmarks. In general, DreamMask significantly simplifies the collection of large-scale training data, serving as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing methods. For instance, when trained on COCO and tested on ADE20K, the model equipped with DreamMask outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a substantial margin of 2.1% mIoU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project url: https://yuanpengtu.github.io/Dreammask-Page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yuanpengtu.github.io/Dreammask-Page) |

This enables the precision application of herbicide only to weeds, or the precision application of fertilizer only to undernourished crops, rather than to the entire field. The approach promises to maximize yields while minimizing resource use and harm to the surrounding environment. To this end, we propose a hierarchical panoptic segmentation method that simultaneously determines leaf count (as an identifier of plant growth)and locates weeds within an image. In particular, our approach aims to improve the segmentation of smaller instances like the leaves and weeds by incorporating focal loss and boundary loss. Not only does this result in competitive performance, achieving a PQ+ of 81.89 on the standard training set, but we also demonstrate we can improve leaf-counting accuracy with our method.

This task can be applied for cameras and LiDAR sensors, but there has been a limited focus on combining both sensors to enhance image panoptic segmentation (PS). Although previous research has acknowledged the benefit of 3D data on camera-based scene perception, no specific study has explored the influence of 3D data on image and video panoptic segmentation (VPS).This work seeks to introduce a feature fusion module that enhances PS and VPS by fusing LiDAR and image data for autonomous vehicles. We also illustrate that, in addition to this fusion, our proposed model, which utilizes two simple modifications, can further deliver even more high-quality VPS without being trained on video data. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement in both the image and video panoptic segmentation evaluation metrics by up to 5 points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> | None |

However, the deployment of such models has been limited due to the expensive nature of dense data annotation, giving rise to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). A key challenge in panoptic UDA is reducing the domain gap between a labeled source and an unlabeled target domain while harmonizing the subtasks of semantic and instance segmentation to limit catastrophic interference. While considerable progress has been achieved, existing approaches mainly focus on the adaptation of semantic segmentation. In this work, we focus on incorporating instance-level adaptation via a novel instance-aware cross-domain mixing strategy IMix. IMix significantly enhances the panoptic quality by improving instance segmentation performance. Specifically, we propose inserting high-confidence predicted instances from the target domain onto source images, retaining the exhaustiveness of the resulting pseudo-labels while reducing the injected confirmation bias. Nevertheless, such an enhancement comes at the cost of degraded semantic performance, attributed to catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we regularize our semantic branch by employing CLIP-based domain alignment (CDA), exploiting the domain-robustness of natural language prompts. Finally, we present an end-to-end model incorporating these two mechanisms called LIDAPS, achieving state-of-the-art results on all popular panoptic UDA benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> | None |

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 43.3 million people were blind in 2020, and this number is projected to reach 61 million by 2050. Modern scene understanding models could empower these people by assisting them with navigation, obstacle avoidance and visual recognition capabilities. The research community needs high quality datasets for both training and evaluation to build these systems. While datasets for autonomous vehicles are abundant, there is a critical gap in datasets tailored for outdoor human navigation. This gap poses a major obstacle to the development of computer vision based Assistive Technologies. To overcome this obstacle, we present SANPO, a large-scale egocentric video dataset designed for dense prediction in outdoor human navigation environments. SANPO contains 701 stereo videos of 30+ seconds captured in diverse real-world outdoor environments across four geographic locations in the USA. Every frame has a high resolution depth map and 112K frames were annotated with temporally consistent dense video panoptic segmentation labels. The dataset also includes 1961 high-quality synthetic videos with pixel accurate depth and panoptic segmentation annotations to balance the noisy real world annotations with the high precision synthetic annotations.

It is crucial that these systems are able to understand their surroundings in order to operate safely and robustly. Additionally, autonomous systems deployed in unconstrained real-world scenarios must be able of dealing with novel situations and object that have never been seen before. In this article, we tackle the problem of open-world panoptic segmentation, i.e., the task of discovering new semantic categories and new object instances at test time, while enforcing consistency among the categories that we incrementally discover. We propose Con2MAV, an approach for open-world panoptic segmentation that extends our previous work, ContMAV, which was developed for open-world semantic segmentation. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, we show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on open-world segmentation tasks, while still performing competitively on the known categories. We will open-source our implementation upon acceptance. Additionally, we propose PANIC (Panoptic ANomalies In Context), a benchmark for evaluating open-world panoptic segmentation in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset, recorded with a multi-modal sensor suite mounted on a car, provides high-quality, pixel-wise annotations of anomalous objects at both semantic and instance level. Our dataset contains 800 images, with more than 50 unknown classes, i.e., classes that do not appear in the training set, and 4000 object instances, making it an extremely challenging dataset for open-world segmentation tasks in the autonomous driving scenario.

Existing methods typically employ two-stage or single-stage framework. The two-stage framework involves cropping the image multiple times using masks generated by a mask generator, followed by feature extraction, while the single-stage framework relies on a heavyweight mask decoder to make up for the lack of spatial position information through self-attention and cross-attention in multiple stacked Transformer blocks. Both methods incur substantial computational overhead, thereby hindering the efficiency of model inference. To fill the gap in efficiency, we propose EOV-Seg, a novel single-stage, shared, efficient, and spatialaware framework designed for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Specifically, EOV-Seg innovates in two aspects. First, a Vocabulary-Aware Selection (VAS) module is proposed to improve the semantic comprehension of visual aggregated features and alleviate the feature interaction burden on the mask decoder. Second, we introduce a Two-way Dynamic Embedding Experts (TDEE), which efficiently utilizes the spatial awareness capabilities of ViT-based CLIP backbone. To the best of our knowledge, EOV-Seg is the first open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation framework towards efficiency, which runs faster and achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, with COCO training only, EOV-Seg achieves 24.5 PQ, 32.1 mIoU, and 11.6 FPS on the ADE20K dataset and the inference time of EOV-Seg is 4-19 times faster than state-of-theart methods. Especially, equipped with ResNet50 backbone, EOV-Seg runs 23.8 FPS with only 71M parameters on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

Robots need to identify which objects, along with their positions and shapes, to manipulate them precisely with given tasks. Mobile robots, especially, usually use lightweight networks to segment objects on RGB images and then localize them via depth maps; however, they often encounter out-of-distribution scenarios where masks over-cover the objects. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation quality in 3D scene reconstruction by refining segmentation errors using non-parametric statistical methods. To enhance mask precision, we map the predicted masks into a depth frame to estimate their distribution via kernel densities. The outliers in depth perception are then rejected without the need for additional parameters in an adaptive manner to out-of-distribution scenarios, followed by 3D reconstruction using projective signed distance functions (SDFs). We validate our method on a synthetic dataset, which shows improvements in both quantitative and qualitative results for panoptic mapping. Through real-world testing, the results furthermore show our method's capability to be deployed on a real-robot system.

Recent mask-transformer-based methods achieve impressive performance on standard benchmarks but face significant challenges with small objects, crowded scenes and scenes exhibiting a wide range of object scales. We identify several fundamental shortcomings of the current approaches: (i) the query proposal generation process is biased towards larger objects, resulting in missed smaller objects, (ii) initially well-localized queries may drift to other objects, resulting in missed detections, (iii) spatially well-separated instances may be merged into a single mask causing inconsistent and false scene interpretations. To address these issues, we rethink the individual components of the network and its supervision, and propose a novel method for panoptic segmentation PanSR. PanSR effectively mitigates instance merging, enhances small-object detection and increases performance in crowded scenes, delivering a notable +3.4 PQ improvement over state-of-the-art on the challenging LaRS benchmark, while reaching state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes.

This is essential not only to decrease operating costs but also to speed up deployment time. In this work, we address this challenge for PAnoptic SegmenTation with fEw Labels (PASTEL) by exploiting the groundwork paved by visual foundation models. We leverage descriptive image features from such a model to train two lightweight network heads for semantic segmentation and object boundary detection, using very few annotated training samples. We then merge their predictions via a novel fusion module that yields panoptic maps based on normalized cut. To further enhance the performance, we utilize self-training on unlabeled images selected by a feature-driven similarity scheme. We underline the relevance of our approach by employing PASTEL to important robot perception use cases from autonomous driving and agricultural robotics.

However, existing upsamplers either lack specific feature guidance or necessitate the utilization of high-resolution feature maps, resulting in a loss of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we find that the local self-attention naturally has the feature guidance capability, and its computational paradigm aligns closely with the essence of feature upsampling (\ie feature reassembly of neighboring points). Therefore, we introduce local self-attention into the upsampling task and demonstrate that the majority of existing upsamplers can be regarded as special cases of upsamplers based on local self-attention. Considering the potential semantic gap between upsampled points and their neighboring points, we further introduce the deformation mechanism into the upsampler based on local self-attention, thereby proposing LDA-AQU. As a novel dynamic kernel-based upsampler, LDA-AQU utilizes the feature of queries to guide the model in adaptively adjusting the position and aggregation weight of neighboring points, thereby meeting the upsampling requirements across various complex scenarios. In addition, LDA-AQU is lightweight and can be easily integrated into various model architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of LDA-AQU across four dense prediction tasks: object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and semantic segmentation. LDA-AQU consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art upsamplers, achieving performance enhancements of 1.7 AP, 1.5 AP, 2.0 PQ, and 2.5 mIoU compared to the baseline models in the aforementioned four tasks, respectively.

With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts.

However, benchmarking VLMs for ATs remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we first create a novel AT benchmark (@Bench). Guided by a pre-design user study with PVIs, our benchmark includes the five most crucial vision-language tasks: Panoptic Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Image Captioning, and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Besides, we propose a novel AT model (@Model) that addresses all tasks simultaneously and can be expanded to more assistive functions for helping PVIs. Our framework exhibits outstanding performance across tasks by integrating multi-modal information, and it offers PVIs a more comprehensive assistance. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025, project page: https://junweizheng93.github.io/publications/ATBench/ATBench.html</p></details> | [Code Link](https://junweizheng93.github.io/publications) |

This study tackles the issue of postharvest quality assessment of bananas in decentralized supply chains. We propose a method to detect and segment surface defects in banana images using panoptic segmentation to quantify defect size and number. Instead of time-consuming pixel-level annotations, we use weak supervision with coarse labels. A dataset of 476 smartphone images of bananas was collected under real-world field conditions and annotated for bruises and scars. Using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a recently published foundation model for image segmentation, we generated dense annotations from coarse bounding boxes to train a segmentation model, significantly reducing manual effort while achieving a panoptic quality score of 77.6%. This demonstrates SAM's potential for low-effort, accurate segmentation in agricultural settings with limited data.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper we report on our progress in digitizing the agricultural landscape (natural and man-made) in our study region of India. We use high resolution imagery and a UNet style segmentation model to generate the first of its kind national-scale multi-class panoptic segmentation output. Through this work we have been able to identify individual fields across 151.7M hectares, and delineating key features such as water resources and vegetation. We share how this output was validated by our team and externally by downstream users, including some sample use cases that can lead to targeted data driven decision making.

Towards this goal, we investigate spatio-temporal attention mechanisms underlying video memorability. Different from previous works that fuse multiple features, we adopt a simple CNN+Transformer architecture that enables analysis of spatio-temporal attention while matching state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on video memorability prediction. We compare model attention against human gaze fixations collected through a small-scale eye-tracking study where humans perform the video memory task. We uncover the following insights: (i) Quantitative saliency metrics show that our model, trained only to predict a memorability score, exhibits similar spatial attention patterns to human gaze, especially for more memorable videos. (ii) The model assigns greater importance to initial frames in a video, mimicking human attention patterns. (iii) Panoptic segmentation reveals that both (model and humans) assign a greater share of attention to things and less attention to stuff as compared to their occurrence probability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[UMG-CLIP: A Unified Multi-Granularity Vision Generalist for Open-World Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06397v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models, represented by Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have gained increasing attention for jointly understanding both vision and textual tasks. However, existing approaches primarily focus on training models to match global image representations with textual descriptions, thereby overlooking the critical alignment between local regions and corresponding text tokens. This paper extends CLIP with multi-granularity alignment. Notably, we deliberately construct a new dataset comprising pseudo annotations at various levels of granularities, encompassing image-level, region-level as well as pixel-level captions and tags. Accordingly, we develop a Unified Multi-Granularity learning framework, termed UMG-CLIP, which simultaneously empowers the model with versatile perception abilities across different levels of detail. With parameter efficient tuning, UMG-CLIP surpasses current widely used CLIP variants and achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse image understanding benchmarks, including open-world recognition, retrieval, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. We believe that UMG-CLIP represents a valuable advancement in vision-language foundation models.

| **[PLGS: Robust Panoptic Lifting with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17505v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous methods utilize the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for panoptic lifting, while their training and rendering speed are unsatisfactory. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent technique due to its rapid training and rendering speed. However, unlike NeRF, the conventional 3DGS may not satisfy the basic smoothness assumption as it does not rely on any parameterized structures to render (e.g., MLPs). Consequently, the conventional 3DGS is, in nature, more susceptible to noisy 2D mask supervision. In this paper, we propose a new method called PLGS that enables 3DGS to generate consistent panoptic segmentation masks from noisy 2D segmentation masks while maintaining superior efficiency compared to NeRF-based methods. Specifically, we build a panoptic-aware structured 3D Gaussian model to introduce smoothness and design effective noise reduction strategies. For the semantic field, instead of initialization with structure from motion, we construct reliable semantic anchor points to initialize the 3D Gaussians. We then use these anchor points as smooth regularization during training. Additionally, we present a self-training approach using pseudo labels generated by merging the rendered masks with the noisy masks to enhance the robustness of PLGS. For the instance field, we project the 2D instance masks into 3D space and match them with oriented bounding boxes to generate cross-view consistent instance masks for supervision. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both segmentation quality and speed.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, we consider the question of whether video segmentation models trained on generic segmentation data could be more effective for particular robot platforms if robot embodiment is factored into the data generation process. To answer this question, a pipeline is formulated for using 3D reconstructions (e.g. from HM3DSem) to generate segmented videos that are configurable based on a robot's embodiment (e.g. sensor type, sensor placement, and illumination source). A resulting massive RGB-D video panoptic segmentation dataset (MVPd) is introduced for extensive benchmarking with foundation and video segmentation models, as well as to support embodiment-focused research in video segmentation. Our experimental findings demonstrate that using MVPd for finetuning can lead to performance improvements when transferring foundation models to certain robot embodiments, such as specific camera placements. These experiments also show that using 3D modalities (depth images and camera pose) can lead to improvements in video segmentation accuracy and consistency.

However, the quality of its results largely depends on the 2D segmentations, which could be noisy and error-prone, so its performance often drops significantly for complex scenes. In this work, we design a new pipeline coined PCF-Lift based on our Probabilis-tic Contrastive Fusion (PCF) to learn and embed probabilistic features throughout our pipeline to actively consider inaccurate segmentations and inconsistent instance IDs. Technical-wise, we first model the probabilistic feature embeddings through multivariate Gaussian distributions. To fuse the probabilistic features, we incorporate the probability product kernel into the contrastive loss formulation and design a cross-view constraint to enhance the feature consistency across different views. For the inference, we introduce a new probabilistic clustering method to effectively associate prototype features with the underlying 3D object instances for the generation of consistent panoptic segmentation results. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis to justify the superiority of the proposed probabilistic solution. By conducting extensive experiments, our PCF-lift not only significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on widely used benchmarks including the ScanNet dataset and the challenging Messy Room dataset (4.4% improvement of scene-level PQ), but also demonstrates strong robustness when incorporating various 2D segmentation models or different levels of hand-crafted noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

However, challenges persist with existing methods, including precise 2D-to-3D mapping, handling complex scene characteristics like boundary ambiguity and varying scales, and mitigating noise in panoptic pseudo-labels. This paper introduces a novel perceptual-prior-guided 3D scene representation and panoptic understanding method, which reformulates panoptic understanding within neural radiance fields as a linear assignment problem involving 2D semantics and instance recognition. Perceptual information from pre-trained 2D panoptic segmentation models is incorporated as prior guidance, thereby synchronizing the learning processes of appearance, geometry, and panoptic understanding within neural radiance fields. An implicit scene representation and understanding model is developed to enhance generalization across indoor and outdoor scenes by extending the scale-encoded cascaded grids within a reparameterized domain distillation framework. This model effectively manages complex scene attributes and generates 3D-consistent scene representations and panoptic understanding outcomes for various scenes. Experiments and ablation studies under challenging conditions, including synthetic and real-world scenes, demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in enhancing 3D scene representation and panoptic segmentation accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

This work presents a comprehensive panoptic scene understanding solution designed to handle the complexities of such environments by integrating 2D panoptic segmentation with 3D LiDAR mapping. Our system generates detailed environmental representations in real-time by combining semantic and geometric data, supported by Kalman Filter-based tracking for dynamic object detection. We introduce a fine-tuning method that adapts large pre-trained panoptic segmentation models for construction site applications using a limited number of domain-specific samples. For this use case, we release a first-of-its-kind dataset of 502 hand-labeled sample images with panoptic annotations from construction sites. In addition, we propose a dynamic panoptic mapping technique that enhances scene understanding in unstructured environments. As a case study, we demonstrate the system's application for autonomous navigation, utilizing real-time RRT* for reactive path planning in dynamic scenarios.

However, existing semantic perception datasets often lack important non-camera modalities typically used in autonomous vehicles, or they do not exploit such modalities to aid and improve semantic annotations in challenging conditions. To address this, we introduce MUSES, the MUlti-SEnsor Semantic perception dataset for driving in adverse conditions under increased uncertainty. MUSES includes synchronized multimodal recordings with 2D panoptic annotations for 2500 images captured under diverse weather and illumination. The dataset integrates a frame camera, a lidar, a radar, an event camera, and an IMU/GNSS sensor. Our new two-stage panoptic annotation protocol captures both class-level and instance-level uncertainty in the ground truth and enables the novel task of uncertainty-aware panoptic segmentation we introduce, along with standard semantic and panoptic segmentation. MUSES proves both effective for training and challenging for evaluating models under diverse visual conditions, and it opens new avenues for research in multimodal and uncertainty-aware dense semantic perception.

In this paper, we leverage the abundance of freely accessible trained models to introduce a cost-free approach to model merging. It focuses on a layer-wise integration of merged models, aiming to maintain the distinctiveness of the task-specific final layers while unifying the initial layers, which are primarily associated with feature extraction. This approach ensures parameter consistency across all layers, essential for boosting performance. Moreover, it facilitates seamless integration of knowledge, enabling effective merging of models from different datasets and tasks. Specifically, we investigate its applicability in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), an unexplored area for model merging, for Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial UDA improvements without additional costs for merging same-architecture models from distinct datasets ($\uparrow 2.6\%$ mIoU) and different-architecture models with a shared backbone ($\uparrow 6.8\%$ mIoU). Furthermore, merging Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation models increases mPQ by $\uparrow 7\%$. These findings are validated across a wide variety of UDA strategies, architectures, and datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lidar Panoptic Segmentation in an Open World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14273v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing Lidar Panoptic Segmentation (LPS ) is crucial for safe deployment of autonomous vehicles. LPS aims to recognize and segment lidar points w.r.t. a pre-defined vocabulary of semantic classes, including thing classes of countable objects (e.g., pedestrians and vehicles) and stuff classes of amorphous regions (e.g., vegetation and road). Importantly, LPS requires segmenting individual thing instances (e.g., every single vehicle). Current LPS methods make an unrealistic assumption that the semantic class vocabulary is fixed in the real open world, but in fact, class ontologies usually evolve over time as robots encounter instances of novel classes that are considered to be unknowns w.r.t. the pre-defined class vocabulary. To address this unrealistic assumption, we study LPS in the Open World (LiPSOW): we train models on a dataset with a pre-defined semantic class vocabulary and study their generalization to a larger dataset where novel instances of thing and stuff classes can appear. This experimental setting leads to interesting conclusions. While prior art train class-specific instance segmentation methods and obtain state-of-the-art results on known classes, methods based on class-agnostic bottom-up grouping perform favorably on classes outside of the initial class vocabulary (i.e., unknown classes). Unfortunately, these methods do not perform on-par with fully data-driven methods on known classes. Our work suggests a middle ground: we perform class-agnostic point clustering and over-segment the input cloud in a hierarchical fashion, followed by binary point segment classification, akin to Region Proposal Network [1]. We obtain the final point cloud segmentation by computing a cut in the weighted hierarchical tree of point segments, independently of semantic classification. Remarkably, this unified approach leads to strong performance on both known and unknown classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print.

However, existing efforts suffer from inefficiency in terms of inference speed and accuracy, limiting their practical applicability. We present EPRecon, an efficient real-time panoptic 3D reconstruction framework. Current volumetric-based reconstruction methods usually utilize multi-view depth map fusion to obtain scene depth priors, which is time-consuming and poses challenges to real-time scene reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight module to directly estimate scene depth priors in a 3D volume for reconstruction quality improvement by generating occupancy probabilities of all voxels. In addition, compared with existing panoptic segmentation methods, EPRecon extracts panoptic features from both voxel features and corresponding image features, obtaining more detailed and comprehensive instance-level semantic information and achieving more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on the ScanNetV2 dataset demonstrate the superiority of EPRecon over current state-of-the-art methods in terms of both panoptic 3D reconstruction quality and real-time inference.

Recent methods have explored semantic and panoptic scene forecasting; however, they do not consider the geometry of the scene. In this work, we propose the panoptic-depth forecasting task for jointly predicting the panoptic segmentation and depth maps of unobserved future frames, from monocular camera images. To facilitate this work, we extend the popular KITTI-360 and Cityscapes benchmarks by computing depth maps from LiDAR point clouds and leveraging sequential labeled data. We also introduce a suitable evaluation metric that quantifies both the panoptic quality and depth estimation accuracy of forecasts in a coherent manner. Furthermore, we present two baselines and propose the novel PDcast architecture that learns rich spatio-temporal representations by incorporating a transformer-based encoder, a forecasting module, and task-specific decoders to predict future panoptic-depth outputs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of PDcast across two datasets and three forecasting tasks, consistently addressing the primary challenges.

| **[Resolving Inconsistent Semantics in Multi-Dataset Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09893v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging multiple training datasets to scale up image segmentation models is beneficial for increasing robustness and semantic understanding. Individual datasets have well-defined ground truth with non-overlapping mask layouts and mutually exclusive semantics. However, merging them for multi-dataset training disrupts this harmony and leads to semantic inconsistencies; for example, the class "person" in one dataset and class "face" in another will require multilabel handling for certain pixels. Existing methods struggle with this setting, particularly when evaluated on label spaces mixed from the individual training sets. To overcome these issues, we introduce a simple yet effective multi-dataset training approach by integrating language-based embeddings of class names and label space-specific query embeddings. Our method maintains high performance regardless of the underlying inconsistencies between training datasets. Notably, on four benchmark datasets with label space inconsistencies during inference, we outperform previous methods by 1.6% mIoU for semantic segmentation, 9.1% PQ for panoptic segmentation, 12.1% AP for instance segmentation, and 3.0% in the newly proposed PIQ metric.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous discriminative methods achieve only weak or coarse-grained alignment by panoptic segmentation pretraining or CLIP model adaptation. Given the recent progress of text-to-image Diffusion models, several works have shown their capability to achieve fine-grained image-text alignment through cross-attention maps and improved general segmentation performance. However, the direct use of phrase features as static prompts to apply frozen Diffusion models to the PNG task still suffers from a large task gap and insufficient vision-language interaction, yielding inferior performance. Therefore, we propose an Extractive-Injective Phrase Adapter (EIPA) bypass within the Diffusion UNet to dynamically update phrase prompts with image features and inject the multimodal cues back, which leverages the fine-grained image-text alignment capability of Diffusion models more sufficiently. In addition, we also design a Multi-Level Mutual Aggregation (MLMA) module to reciprocally fuse multi-level image and phrase features for segmentation refinement. Extensive experiments on the PNG benchmark show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Localizing Structural Elements: Merging Geometrical Detection with Semantic Verification in RGB-D Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06625v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-D cameras supply rich and dense visual and spatial information for various robotics tasks such as scene understanding, map reconstruction, and localization. Integrating depth and visual information can aid robots in localization and element mapping, advancing applications like 3D scene graph generation and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM). While point cloud data containing such information is primarily used for enhanced scene understanding, exploiting their potential to capture and represent rich semantic information has yet to be adequately targeted. This paper presents a real-time pipeline for localizing building components, including wall and ground surfaces, by integrating geometric calculations for pure 3D plane detection followed by validating their semantic category using point cloud data from RGB-D cameras. It has a parallel multi-thread architecture to precisely estimate poses and equations of all the planes detected in the environment, filters the ones forming the map structure using a panoptic segmentation validation, and keeps only the validated building components. Incorporating the proposed method into a VSLAM framework confirmed that constraining the map with the detected environment-driven semantic elements can improve scene understanding and map reconstruction accuracy. It can also ensure (re-)association of these detected components into a unified 3D scene graph, bridging the gap between geometric accuracy and semantic understanding. Additionally, the pipeline allows for the detection of potential higher-level structural entities, such as rooms, by identifying the relationships between building components based on their layout.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures. 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation approaches such as Monte Carlo Dropout have been successfully used in many applications in an attempt to address this robustness issue. Unfortunately, it is not always clear if such ensemble-based approaches can be applied to a new problem domain. This is the case with panoptic segmentation, where the structure of the problem and architectures designed to solve it means that unlike image classification or even semantic segmentation, the typical solution of using a mean across samples cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we demonstrate how ensemble-based uncertainty estimation approaches such as Monte Carlo Dropout can be used in the panoptic segmentation domain with no changes to an existing network, providing both improved performance and more importantly a better measure of uncertainty for predictions made by the network. Results are demonstrated quantitatively and qualitatively on the COCO, KITTI-STEP and VIPER datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures including Supplementary Material.

However, NeRFs remain difficult to segment into semantically meaningful regions. Previous approaches to 3D segmentation of NeRFs either require user interaction to isolate a single object, or they rely on 2D semantic masks with a limited number of classes for supervision. As a consequence, they generalize poorly to class-agnostic masks automatically generated in real scenes. This is attributable to the ambiguity arising from zero-shot segmentation, yielding inconsistent masks across views. In contrast, we propose a method that is robust to inconsistent segmentations and successfully decomposes the scene into a set of objects of any class. By introducing a limited number of competing object slots against which masks are matched, a meaningful object representation emerges that best explains the 2D supervision and minimizes an additional regularization term. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to generate 3D panoptic segmentations on complex scenes, and extract high-quality 3D assets from NeRFs that can then be used in virtual 3D environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous works utilize separate approaches to handle things, stuff, and part predictions without shared computation and task association. We aim to unify these tasks at the architectural level, designing the first end-to-end unified framework, Panoptic-PartFormer. Moreover, we find the previous metric PartPQ biases to PQ. To handle both issues, we first design a meta-architecture that decouples part features and things/stuff features, respectively. We model things, stuff, and parts as object queries and directly learn to optimize all three forms of prediction as a unified mask prediction and classification problem. We term our model as Panoptic-PartFormer. Second, we propose a new metric Part-Whole Quality (PWQ), better to measure this task from pixel-region and part-whole perspectives. It also decouples the errors for part segmentation and panoptic segmentation. Third, inspired by Mask2Former, based on our meta-architecture, we propose Panoptic-PartFormer++ and design a new part-whole cross-attention scheme to boost part segmentation qualities further. We design a new part-whole interaction method using masked cross attention. Finally, extensive ablation studies and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of both Panoptic-PartFormer and Panoptic-PartFormer++. Compared with previous Panoptic-PartFormer, our Panoptic-PartFormer++ achieves 2% PartPQ and 3% PWQ improvements on the Cityscapes PPS dataset and 5% PartPQ on the Pascal Context PPS dataset.

| **[DQFormer: Towards Unified LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation with Decoupled Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15813v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR panoptic segmentation, which jointly performs instance and semantic segmentation for things and stuff classes, plays a fundamental role in LiDAR perception tasks. While most existing methods explicitly separate these two segmentation tasks and utilize different branches (i.e., semantic and instance branches), some recent methods have embraced the query-based paradigm to unify LiDAR panoptic segmentation. However, the distinct spatial distribution and inherent characteristics of objects(things) and their surroundings(stuff) in 3D scenes lead to challenges, including the mutual competition of things/stuff and the ambiguity of classification/segmentation. In this paper, we propose decoupling things/stuff queries according to their intrinsic properties for individual decoding and disentangling classification/segmentation to mitigate ambiguity. To this end, we propose a novel framework dubbed DQFormer to implement semantic and instance segmentation in a unified workflow. Specifically, we design a decoupled query generator to propose informative queries with semantics by localizing things/stuff positions and fusing multi-level BEV embeddings. Moreover, a query-oriented mask decoder is introduced to decode corresponding segmentation masks by performing masked cross-attention between queries and mask embeddings. Finally, the decoded masks are combined with the semantics of the queries to produce panoptic results. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DQFormer framework.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures | None |

We discover that traditional continual training results in severe catastrophic forgetting, failing to outperform a zero-shot segmentation baseline. We introduce a novel training-free strategy, kNN-CLIP, which augments the model with a database of instance embeddings for semantic and panoptic segmentation that achieves zero forgetting. We demonstrate that kNN-CLIP can adapt to continually growing vocabularies without the need for retraining or large memory costs. kNN-CLIP enables open-vocabulary segmentation methods to expand their vocabularies on any domain with a single pass through the data, while only storing compact embeddings. This approach minimizes both compute and memory costs. kNN-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across large-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation datasets. We hope kNN-CLIP represents a significant step forward in enabling more efficient and adaptable continual segmentation, paving the way for advances in real-world large-vocabulary continual segmentation methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pair then Relation: Pair-Net for Panoptic Scene Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08699v3)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) is a challenging task in Scene Graph Generation (SGG) that aims to create a more comprehensive scene graph representation using panoptic segmentation instead of boxes. Compared to SGG, PSG has several challenging problems: pixel-level segment outputs and full relationship exploration (It also considers thing and stuff relation). Thus, current PSG methods have limited performance, which hinders downstream tasks or applications. The goal of this work aims to design a novel and strong baseline for PSG. To achieve that, we first conduct an in-depth analysis to identify the bottleneck of the current PSG models, finding that inter-object pair-wise recall is a crucial factor that was ignored by previous PSG methods. Based on this and the recent query-based frameworks, we present a novel framework: Pair then Relation (Pair-Net), which uses a Pair Proposal Network (PPN) to learn and filter sparse pair-wise relationships between subjects and objects. Moreover, we also observed the sparse nature of object pairs for both Motivated by this, we design a lightweight Matrix Learner within the PPN, which directly learns pair-wised relationships for pair proposal generation. Through extensive ablation and analysis, our approach significantly improves upon leveraging the segmenter solid baseline. Notably, our method achieves over 10\% absolute gains compared to our baseline, PSGFormer.

| **[Better Call SAL: Towards Learning to Segment Anything in Lidar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13129v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the SAL (Segment Anything in Lidar) method consisting of a text-promptable zero-shot model for segmenting and classifying any object in Lidar, and a pseudo-labeling engine that facilitates model training without manual supervision. While the established paradigm for Lidar Panoptic Segmentation (LPS) relies on manual supervision for a handful of object classes defined a priori, we utilize 2D vision foundation models to generate 3D supervision ``for free''. Our pseudo-labels consist of instance masks and corresponding CLIP tokens, which we lift to Lidar using calibrated multi-modal data. By training our model on these labels, we distill the 2D foundation models into our Lidar SAL model. Even without manual labels, our model achieves $91\%$ in terms of class-agnostic segmentation and $54\%$ in terms of zero-shot Lidar Panoptic Segmentation of the fully supervised state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we outperform several baselines that do not distill but only lift image features to 3D. More importantly, we demonstrate that SAL supports arbitrary class prompts, can be easily extended to new datasets, and shows significant potential to improve with increasing amounts of self-labeled data.

This paper presents SAM-CP, a simple approach that establishes two types of composable prompts beyond SAM and composes them for versatile segmentation. Specifically, given a set of classes (in texts) and a set of SAM patches, the Type-I prompt judges whether a SAM patch aligns with a text label, and the Type-II prompt judges whether two SAM patches with the same text label also belong to the same instance. To decrease the complexity in dealing with a large number of semantic classes and patches, we establish a unified framework that calculates the affinity between (semantic and instance) queries and SAM patches and merges patches with high affinity to the query. Experiments show that SAM-CP achieves semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation in both open and closed domains. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our research offers a novel and generalized methodology for equipping vision foundation models like SAM with multi-grained semantic perception abilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Strike a Balance in Continual Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16354v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the emerging area of continual panoptic segmentation, highlighting three key balances. First, we introduce past-class backtrace distillation to balance the stability of existing knowledge with the adaptability to new information. This technique retraces the features associated with past classes based on the final label assignment results, performing knowledge distillation targeting these specific features from the previous model while allowing other features to flexibly adapt to new information. Additionally, we introduce a class-proportional memory strategy, which aligns the class distribution in the replay sample set with that of the historical training data. This strategy maintains a balanced class representation during replay, enhancing the utility of the limited-capacity replay sample set in recalling prior classes. Moreover, recognizing that replay samples are annotated only for the classes of their original step, we devise balanced anti-misguidance losses, which combat the impact of incomplete annotations without incurring classification bias. Building upon these innovations, we present a new method named Balanced Continual Panoptic Segmentation (BalConpas). Our evaluation on the challenging ADE20K dataset demonstrates its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, analyzing mammography images is a demanding task for radiologists, who often review hundreds of mammograms daily, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to assist in this process, but their capabilities, particularly in lesion segmentation, remained limited. With the contemporary advances in deep learning their performance may be improved. Recently, vision-language diffusion models emerged, demonstrating outstanding performance in image generation and transferability to various downstream tasks. We aim to harness their capabilities for breast lesion segmentation in a panoptic setting, which encompasses both semantic and instance-level predictions. Specifically, we propose leveraging pretrained features from a Stable Diffusion model as inputs to a state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation architecture, resulting in accurate delineation of individual breast lesions. To bridge the gap between natural and medical imaging domains, we incorporated a mammography-specific MAM-E diffusion model and BiomedCLIP image and text encoders into this framework. We evaluated our approach on two recently published mammography datasets, CDD-CESM and VinDr-Mammo. For the instance segmentation task, we noted 40.25 AP0.1 and 46.82 AP0.05, as well as 25.44 PQ0.1 and 26.92 PQ0.05. For the semantic segmentation task, we achieved Dice scores of 38.86 and 40.92, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures.

Previous state of the art addresses this problem with cross-task consistency, careful system-level optimization and heuristic improvement of teacher predictions. In contrast, we propose to build upon remarkable capability of mask transformers to estimate their own prediction uncertainty. Our method avoids noise amplification by leveraging fine-grained confidence of panoptic teacher predictions. In particular, we modulate the loss with mask-wide confidence and discourage back-propagation in pixels with uncertain teacher or confident student. Experimental evaluation on standard benchmarks reveals a substantial contribution of the proposed selection techniques. We report 47.4 PQ on Synthia to Cityscapes, which corresponds to an improvement of 6.2 percentage points over the state of the art.

To this end, we propose two surprisingly simple modifications to decoder-only transformers: 1) at the input, we replace the finite-vocabulary lookup table with a linear projection of the input vectors; and 2) at the output, we replace the logits prediction (usually mapped to a categorical distribution) with the parameters of a multivariate Gaussian mixture model. Inspired by the image-generation paradigm of VQ-GAN and MaskGIT, where transformers are used to model the discrete latent sequences of a VQ-VAE, we use GIVT to model the unquantized real-valued latent sequences of a $\beta$-VAE. In class-conditional image generation GIVT outperforms VQ-GAN (and improved variants thereof) as well as MaskGIT, and achieves performance competitive with recent latent diffusion models. Finally, we obtain strong results outside of image generation when applying GIVT to panoptic segmentation and depth estimation with a VAE variant of the UViM framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: a...</summary><p>v2: add related NLP work, loss details. v3: Improved GMM formulation, added adapter module, larger models, better image generation results. v4: ECCV 2024 camera ready version (minor changes).

This work builds upon Stable Diffusion and proposes a latent diffusion approach for panoptic segmentation, resulting in a simple architecture that omits these complexities. Our training consists of two steps: (1) training a shallow autoencoder to project the segmentation masks to latent space; (2) training a diffusion model to allow image-conditioned sampling in latent space. This generative approach unlocks the exploration of mask completion or inpainting. The experimental validation on COCO and ADE20k yields strong segmentation results.

Previous methods focus on predicting predefined object and relation categories, hence limiting their applications in the open world scenarios. With the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), significant progress has been made in open-set object detection and segmentation, yet open-set relation prediction in PSG remains unexplored. In this paper, we focus on the task of open-set relation prediction integrated with a pretrained open-set panoptic segmentation model to achieve true open-set panoptic scene graph generation (OpenPSG). Our OpenPSG leverages LMMs to achieve open-set relation prediction in an autoregressive manner. We introduce a relation query transformer to efficiently extract visual features of object pairs and estimate the existence of relations between them. The latter can enhance the prediction efficiency by filtering irrelevant pairs. Finally, we design the generation and judgement instructions to perform open-set relation prediction in PSG autoregressively. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose the open-set PSG task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-set relation prediction and panoptic scene graph generation.

| **[A Fair Ranking and New Model for Panoptic Scene Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09216v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In panoptic scene graph generation (PSGG), models retrieve interactions between objects in an image which are grounded by panoptic segmentation masks. Previous evaluations on panoptic scene graphs have been subject to an erroneous evaluation protocol where multiple masks for the same object can lead to multiple relation distributions per mask-mask pair. This can be exploited to increase the final score. We correct this flaw and provide a fair ranking over a wide range of existing PSGG models. The observed scores for existing methods increase by up to 7.4 mR@50 for all two-stage methods, while dropping by up to 19.3 mR@50 for all one-stage methods, highlighting the importance of a correct evaluation. Contrary to recent publications, we show that existing two-stage methods are competitive to one-stage methods. Building on this, we introduce the Decoupled SceneFormer (DSFormer), a novel two-stage model that outperforms all existing scene graph models by a large margin of +11 mR@50 and +10 mNgR@50 on the corrected evaluation, thus setting a new SOTA. As a core design principle, DSFormer encodes subject and object masks directly into feature space.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Easy to Hard: Learning Curricular Shape-aware Features for Robust Panoptic Scene Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09191v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) aims to generate a comprehensive graph-structure representation based on panoptic segmentation masks. Despite remarkable progress in PSG, almost all existing methods neglect the importance of shape-aware features, which inherently focus on the contours and boundaries of objects. To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic Curricular shApe-aware FEature (CAFE) learning strategy for PSG. Specifically, we incorporate shape-aware features (i.e., mask features and boundary features) into PSG, moving beyond reliance solely on bbox features. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from human cognition, we propose to integrate shape-aware features in an easy-to-hard manner. To achieve this, we categorize the predicates into three groups based on cognition learning difficulty and correspondingly divide the training process into three stages. Each stage utilizes a specialized relation classifier to distinguish specific groups of predicates. As the learning difficulty of predicates increases, these classifiers are equipped with features of ascending complexity. We also incorporate knowledge distillation to retain knowledge acquired in earlier stages. Due to its model-agnostic nature, CAFE can be seamlessly incorporated into any PSG model. Extensive experiments and ablations on two PSG tasks under both robust and zero-shot PSG have attested to the superiority and robustness of our proposed CAFE, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV | None |

LSB imaging reveals many interesting structures, though these are frequently confused with galactic dust contamination, due to a strong local visual similarity. We propose a novel unified approach to multi-class segmentation of galactic structures and of extended amorphous image contaminants. Our panoptic segmentation model combines Mask R-CNN with a contaminant specialised network and utilises an adaptive preprocessing layer to better capture the subtle features of LSB images. Further, a human-in-the-loop training scheme is employed to augment ground truth labels. These different approaches are evaluated in turn, and together greatly improve the detection of both galactic structures and contaminants in LSB images.</p></details> |  | None |

SegGen designs and integrates two data generation strategies: MaskSyn and ImgSyn. (i) MaskSyn synthesizes new mask-image pairs via our proposed text-to-mask generation model and mask-to-image generation model, greatly improving the diversity in segmentation masks for model supervision; (ii) ImgSyn synthesizes new images based on existing masks using the mask-to-image generation model, strongly improving image diversity for model inputs. On the highly competitive ADE20K and COCO benchmarks, our data generation method markedly improves the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models in semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Notably, in terms of the ADE20K mIoU, Mask2Former R50 is largely boosted from 47.2 to 49.9 (+2.7); Mask2Former Swin-L is also significantly increased from 56.1 to 57.4 (+1.3). These promising results strongly suggest the effectiveness of our SegGen even when abundant human-annotated training data is utilized.

However, most existing methods heavily rely on pre-trained semantic segmentation models and known 3D object bounding boxes for 3D panoptic segmentation, which is not available for in-the-wild scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot panoptic reconstruction method from RGB-D images of scenes. For zero-shot segmentation, we leverage open-vocabulary instance segmentation, but it has to face partial labeling and instance association challenges. We tackle both challenges by propagating partial labels with the aid of dense generalized features and building a 3D instance graph for associating 2D instance IDs. Specifically, we exploit partial labels to learn a classifier for generalized semantic features to provide complete labels for scenes with dense distilled features. Moreover, we formulate instance association as a 3D instance graph segmentation problem, allowing us to fully utilize the scene geometry prior and all 2D instance masks to infer global unique pseudo 3D instance ID. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the indoor dataset ScanNet V2 and the outdoor dataset KITTI-360, demonstrating the effectiveness of our graph segmentation method and reconstruction network.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite considerable progress in bridging the domain gap, existing methods often experience performance degradation when confronted with highly imbalanced dense prediction visual tasks like semantic and panoptic segmentation. This discrepancy becomes especially pronounced due to the lack of equivalent priors between the source and target domains, turning class imbalanced techniques used for other areas (e.g., image classification) ineffective in UDA scenarios. This paper proposes a class-imbalance mitigation strategy that incorporates class-weights into the UDA learning losses, but with the novelty of estimating these weights dynamically through the loss gradient, defining a Gradient-based class weighting (GBW) learning. GBW naturally increases the contribution of classes whose learning is hindered by large-represented classes, and has the advantage of being able to automatically and quickly adapt to the iteration training outcomes, avoiding explicitly curricular learning patterns common in loss-weighing strategies. Extensive experimentation validates the effectiveness of GBW across architectures (convolutional and transformer), UDA strategies (adversarial, self-training and entropy minimization), tasks (semantic and panoptic segmentation), and datasets (GTA and Synthia). Analysing the source of advantage, GBW consistently increases the recall of low represented classes.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods approach PPS by separately conducting object-level and part-level segmentation. However, their part-level predictions are not linked to individual parent objects. Therefore, their learning objective is not aligned with the PPS task objective, which harms the PPS performance. To solve this, and make more accurate PPS predictions, we propose Task-Aligned Part-aware Panoptic Segmentation (TAPPS). This method uses a set of shared queries to jointly predict (a) object-level segments, and (b) the part-level segments within those same objects. As a result, TAPPS learns to predict part-level segments that are linked to individual parent objects, aligning the learning objective with the task objective, and allowing TAPPS to leverage joint object-part representations. With experiments, we show that TAPPS considerably outperforms methods that predict objects and parts separately, and achieves new state-of-the-art PPS results.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

Modern occupancy networks mainly focus on reconstructing visible voxels from object surfaces with voxel-wise semantic prediction. Usually, they suffer from inconsistent predictions of one object and mixed predictions for adjacent objects. These confusions may harm the safety of downstream planning modules. To this end, we investigate panoptic segmentation on 3D voxel scenarios and propose an instance-aware occupancy network, PanoSSC. We predict foreground objects and backgrounds separately and merge both in post-processing. For foreground instance grouping, we propose a novel 3D instance mask decoder that can efficiently extract individual objects. we unify geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation into PanoSSC framework and propose new metrics for evaluating panoptic voxels.

However, existing driving datasets for dense semantic perception are either dominated by images captured under normal conditions or are small in scale. To address this, we introduce ACDC, the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences for training and testing methods for diverse semantic perception tasks on adverse visual conditions. ACDC consists of a large set of 8012 images, half of which (4006) are equally distributed between four common adverse conditions: fog, nighttime, rain, and snow. Each adverse-condition image comes with a high-quality pixel-level panoptic annotation, a corresponding image of the same scene under normal conditions, and a binary mask that distinguishes between intra-image regions of clear and uncertain semantic content. 1503 of the corresponding normal-condition images feature panoptic annotations, raising the total annotated images to 5509. ACDC supports the standard tasks of semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation, as well as the newly introduced uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation. A detailed empirical study demonstrates the challenges that the adverse domains of ACDC pose to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches and indicates the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.

Key ingredients include a well-defined representation of the surroundings to capture its spatial structure as well as assigning semantic meaning while delineating individual objects. Classic components from the toolbox of roboticists to address these tasks are simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and panoptic segmentation. Although recent methods demonstrate impressive advances, mostly due to employing deep learning, they commonly utilize in-domain training on large datasets. Since following such a paradigm substantially limits their real-world application, my research investigates how to minimize human effort in deploying perception-based robotic systems to previously unseen environments. In particular, I focus on leveraging continual learning and reducing human annotations for efficient learning.

| **[4D Panoptic Scene Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10305v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are living in a three-dimensional space while moving forward through a fourth dimension: time. To allow artificial intelligence to develop a comprehensive understanding of such a 4D environment, we introduce 4D Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG-4D), a new representation that bridges the raw visual data perceived in a dynamic 4D world and high-level visual understanding. Specifically, PSG-4D abstracts rich 4D sensory data into nodes, which represent entities with precise location and status information, and edges, which capture the temporal relations. To facilitate research in this new area, we build a richly annotated PSG-4D dataset consisting of 3K RGB-D videos with a total of 1M frames, each of which is labeled with 4D panoptic segmentation masks as well as fine-grained, dynamic scene graphs. To solve PSG-4D, we propose PSG4DFormer, a Transformer-based model that can predict panoptic segmentation masks, track masks along the time axis, and generate the corresponding scene graphs via a relation component. Extensive experiments on the new dataset show that our method can serve as a strong baseline for future research on PSG-4D. In the end, we provide a real-world application example to demonstrate how we can achieve dynamic scene understanding by integrating a large language model into our PSG-4D system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as NeurIPS 2023.

| **[An Integrated Framework for Multi-Granular Explanation of Video Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10082v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an integrated framework for multi-granular explanation of video summarization. This framework integrates methods for producing explanations both at the fragment level (indicating which video fragments influenced the most the decisions of the summarizer) and the more fine-grained visual object level (highlighting which visual objects were the most influential for the summarizer). To build this framework, we extend our previous work on this field, by investigating the use of a model-agnostic, perturbation-based approach for fragment-level explanation of the video summarization results, and introducing a new method that combines the results of video panoptic segmentation with an adaptation of a perturbation-based explanation approach to produce object-level explanations. The performance of the developed framework is evaluated using a state-of-the-art summarization method and two datasets for benchmarking video summarization. The findings of the conducted quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the ability of our framework to spot the most and least influential fragments and visual objects of the video for the summarizer, and to provide a comprehensive set of visual-based explanations about the output of the summarization process.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[Building a Strong Pre-Training Baseline for Universal 3D Large-Scale Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07201v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective pre-training framework with universal 3D representations is extremely desired in perceiving large-scale dynamic scenes. However, establishing such an ideal framework that is both task-generic and label-efficient poses a challenge in unifying the representation of the same primitive across diverse scenes. The current contrastive 3D pre-training methods typically follow a frame-level consistency, which focuses on the 2D-3D relationships in each detached image. Such inconsiderate consistency greatly hampers the promising path of reaching an universal pre-training framework: (1) The cross-scene semantic self-conflict, i.e., the intense collision between primitive segments of the same semantics from different scenes; (2) Lacking a globally unified bond that pushes the cross-scene semantic consistency into 3D representation learning. To address above challenges, we propose a CSC framework that puts a scene-level semantic consistency in the heart, bridging the connection of the similar semantic segments across various scenes. To achieve this goal, we combine the coherent semantic cues provided by the vision foundation model and the knowledge-rich cross-scene prototypes derived from the complementary multi-modality information. These allow us to train a universal 3D pre-training model that facilitates various downstream tasks with less fine-tuning efforts. Empirically, we achieve consistent improvements over SOTA pre-training approaches in semantic segmentation (+1.4% mIoU), object detection (+1.0% mAP), and panoptic segmentation (+3.0% PQ) using their task-specific 3D network on nuScenes.

Thanks to their flexibility, they obtain outstanding performance in multiple segmentation tasks, such as semantic and panoptic, under a single unified framework. To achieve such impressive performance, these architectures employ intensive operations and require substantial computational resources, which are often not available, especially on edge devices. To fill this gap, we propose Prototype-based Efficient MaskFormer (PEM), an efficient transformer-based architecture that can operate in multiple segmentation tasks. PEM proposes a novel prototype-based cross-attention which leverages the redundancy of visual features to restrict the computation and improve the efficiency without harming the performance. In addition, PEM introduces an efficient multi-scale feature pyramid network, capable of extracting features that have high semantic content in an efficient way, thanks to the combination of deformable convolutions and context-based self-modulation. We benchmark the proposed PEM architecture on two tasks, semantic and panoptic segmentation, evaluated on two different datasets, Cityscapes and ADE20K. PEM demonstrates outstanding performance on every task and dataset, outperforming task-specific architectures while being comparable and even better than computationally-expensive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

The ones that deal with dynamic objects in the scenes usually rely on deep-learning-based methods to detect and filter these objects. However, these methods cannot deal with unknown moving objects. This work presents Panoptic-SLAM, an open-source visual SLAM system robust to dynamic environments, even in the presence of unknown objects. It uses panoptic segmentation to filter dynamic objects from the scene during the state estimation process. Panoptic-SLAM is based on ORB-SLAM3, a state-of-the-art SLAM system for static environments. The implementation was tested using real-world datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art systems from the literature, including DynaSLAM, DS-SLAM, SaD-SLAM, PVO and FusingPanoptic. For example, Panoptic-SLAM is on average four times more accurate than PVO, the most recent panoptic-based approach for visual SLAM. Also, experiments were performed using a quadruped robot with an RGB-D camera to test the applicability of our method in real-world scenarios. The tests were validated by a ground-truth created with a motion capture system.</p></details> |  | None |

These steps are indispensable as MRI technology provides detailed information about the tissue structure of the spine. Both supervised and unsupervised segmentation methods exist, yet acquiring sufficient data remains challenging for achieving high accuracy. In this study, we propose an enhancing approach based on modified attention U-Net architecture for panoptic segmentation of 3D sliced MRI data of the lumbar spine. Our method achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.5\% by incorporating novel masking logic, thus significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in vertebral segmentation and labeling. This contributes to more precise and reliable diagnosis and treatment planning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, existing research has primarily concentrated on single-task settings, especially on semantic segmentation, leading to redundant efforts and specialized architectures for different tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel architecture for efficient multi-task image segmentation, capable of handling various segmentation tasks without sacrificing efficiency or accuracy. We introduce BiSeNetFormer, that leverages the efficiency of two-stream semantic segmentation architectures and it extends them into a mask classification framework. Our approach maintains the efficient spatial and context paths to capture detailed and semantic information, respectively, while leveraging an efficient transformed-based segmentation head that computes the binary masks and class probabilities. By seamlessly supporting multiple tasks, namely semantic and panoptic segmentation, BiSeNetFormer offers a versatile solution for multi-task segmentation. We evaluate our approach on popular datasets, Cityscapes and ADE20K, demonstrating impressive inference speeds while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art architectures. Our results indicate that BiSeNetFormer represents a significant advancement towards fast, efficient, and multi-task segmentation networks, bridging the gap between model efficiency and task adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECV workshop at CVPR2024</p></details> | None |

Due to the expensive manual labeling cost, the annotated categories in existing datasets are often small-scale and pre-defined, i.e., state-of-the-art fully-supervised detectors and segmentors fail to generalize beyond the closed vocabulary. To resolve this limitation, in the last few years, the community has witnessed an increasing attention toward Open-Vocabulary Detection (OVD) and Segmentation (OVS). By ``open-vocabulary'', we mean that the models can classify objects beyond pre-defined categories. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review on recent developments of OVD and OVS. A taxonomy is first developed to organize different tasks and methodologies. We find that the permission and usage of weak supervision signals can well discriminate different methodologies, including: visual-semantic space mapping, novel visual feature synthesis, region-aware training, pseudo-labeling, knowledge distillation, and transfer learning. The proposed taxonomy is universal across different tasks, covering object detection, semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation, 3D and video understanding. The main design principles, key challenges, development routes, methodology strengths, and weaknesses are thoroughly analyzed. In addition, we benchmark each task along with the vital components of each method in appendix and updated online at https://github.com/seanzhuh/awesome-open-vocabulary-detection-and-segmentation.

Notably, the established COCO benchmark has propelled the development of modern detection and segmentation systems. However, the COCO segmentation benchmark has seen comparatively slow improvement over the last decade. Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for thing instances, it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel annotations for stuff regions, which were subsequently heuristically amalgamated to yield panoptic segmentation annotations. These annotations, executed by different groups of raters, have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in inconsistencies between segmentation types. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive reevaluation of the COCO segmentation annotations. By enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks, we introduce COCONut, the COCO Next Universal segmenTation dataset. COCONut harmonizes segmentation annotations across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation with meticulously crafted high-quality masks, and establishes a robust benchmark for all segmentation tasks. To our knowledge, COCONut stands as the inaugural large-scale universal segmentation dataset, verified by human raters. We anticipate that the release of COCONut will significantly contribute to the community's ability to assess the progress of novel neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR2024, data available at https://xdeng7.github.io/coconut.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://xdeng7.github.io/coconut.github.io) |

With this intention, we propose Mask4Former for the challenging task of 4D panoptic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds. Mask4Former is the first transformer-based approach unifying semantic instance segmentation and tracking of sparse and irregular sequences of 3D point clouds into a single joint model. Our model directly predicts semantic instances and their temporal associations without relying on hand-crafted non-learned association strategies such as probabilistic clustering or voting-based center prediction. Instead, Mask4Former introduces spatio-temporal instance queries that encode the semantic and geometric properties of each semantic tracklet in the sequence. In an in-depth study, we find that promoting spatially compact instance predictions is critical as spatio-temporal instance queries tend to merge multiple semantically similar instances, even if they are spatially distant. To this end, we regress 6-DOF bounding box parameters from spatio-temporal instance queries, which are used as an auxiliary task to foster spatially compact predictions. Mask4Former achieves a new state-of-the-art on the SemanticKITTI test set with a score of 68.4 LSTQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>Renam...</summary><p>Renamed from MASK4D to Mask4Former.

| **[3D Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation with 2D-3D Vision-Language Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02402v3)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D panoptic segmentation is a challenging perception task, especially in autonomous driving. It aims to predict both semantic and instance annotations for 3D points in a scene. Although prior 3D panoptic segmentation approaches have achieved great performance on closed-set benchmarks, generalizing these approaches to unseen things and unseen stuff categories remains an open problem. For unseen object categories, 2D open-vocabulary segmentation has achieved promising results that solely rely on frozen CLIP backbones and ensembling multiple classification outputs. However, we find that simply extending these 2D models to 3D does not guarantee good performance due to poor per-mask classification quality, especially for novel stuff categories. In this paper, we propose the first method to tackle 3D open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Our model takes advantage of the fusion between learnable LiDAR features and dense frozen vision CLIP features, using a single classification head to make predictions for both base and novel classes. To further improve the classification performance on novel classes and leverage the CLIP model, we propose two novel loss functions: object-level distillation loss and voxel-level distillation loss. Our experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets show that our method outperforms the strong baseline by a large margin.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing diffusion-based video editing approaches lack the ability to offer precise control over generated content that maintains temporal consistency in long-term videos. On the other hand, atlas-based methods provide strong temporal consistency but are costly to edit a video and lack spatial control. In this work, we introduce VidEdit, a novel method for zero-shot text-based video editing that guarantees robust temporal and spatial consistency. In particular, we combine an atlas-based video representation with a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to provide a training-free and efficient video editing method, which by design fulfills temporal smoothness. To grant precise user control over generated content, we utilize conditional information extracted from off-the-shelf panoptic segmenters and edge detectors which guides the diffusion sampling process. This method ensures a fine spatial control on targeted regions while strictly preserving the structure of the original video. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments show that VidEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DAVIS dataset, regarding semantic faithfulness, image preservation, and temporal consistency metrics. With this framework, processing a single video only takes approximately one minute, and it can generate multiple compatible edits based on a unique text prompt.

Real-world robot systems usually collect visual data from multiple sensors and are required to recognize numerous objects and their movements in complex human-crowded settings. Traditional benchmarks, with their reliance on single sensors and limited object classes and scenarios, fail to provide the comprehensive environmental understanding robots need for accurate navigation, interaction, and decision-making. As an extension of JRDB dataset, we unveil JRDB-PanoTrack, a novel open-world panoptic segmentation and tracking benchmark, towards more comprehensive environmental perception. JRDB-PanoTrack includes (1) various data involving indoor and outdoor crowded scenes, as well as comprehensive 2D and 3D synchronized data modalities; (2) high-quality 2D spatial panoptic segmentation and temporal tracking annotations, with additional 3D label projections for further spatial understanding; (3) diverse object classes for closed- and open-world recognition benchmarks, with OSPA-based metrics for evaluation.

| **[ECLIPSE: Efficient Continual Learning in Panoptic Segmentation with Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20126v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoptic segmentation, combining semantic and instance segmentation, stands as a cutting-edge computer vision task. Despite recent progress with deep learning models, the dynamic nature of real-world applications necessitates continual learning, where models adapt to new classes (plasticity) over time without forgetting old ones (catastrophic forgetting). Current continual segmentation methods often rely on distillation strategies like knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling, which are effective but result in increased training complexity and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient method for continual panoptic segmentation based on Visual Prompt Tuning, dubbed ECLIPSE. Our approach involves freezing the base model parameters and fine-tuning only a small set of prompt embeddings, addressing both catastrophic forgetting and plasticity and significantly reducing the trainable parameters. To mitigate inherent challenges such as error propagation and semantic drift in continual segmentation, we propose logit manipulation to effectively leverage common knowledge across the classes. Experiments on ADE20K continual panoptic segmentation benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ECLIPSE, notably its robustness against catastrophic forgetting and its reasonable plasticity, achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Motivated by forecasting sales prices for residential real estate, we harness the power of deep learning to add "information" contained in images as covariates. Specifically, images of homes were categorized and encoded using an ensemble of image classifiers (ResNet-50, VGG16, MobileNet, and Inception V3). Unique features presented within each image were further encoded through panoptic segmentation. Forecasts from a neural network trained on the encoded data results in improved out-of-sample predictive power. We also combine these image-based forecasts with standard hedonic real estate property and location characteristics, resulting in a unified dataset. We show that image-based forecasts increase the accuracy of hedonic forecasts when encoded features are regarded as additional covariates. We also attempt to "explain" which covariates the image-based forecasts are most highly correlated with. The study exemplifies the benefits of interdisciplinary methodologies, merging machine learning and econometrics to harness untapped data sources for more accurate forecasting.</p></details> |  | None |

To overcome the limitation of the LMM being limited to textual output, PSALM incorporates a mask decoder and a well-designed input schema to handle a variety of segmentation tasks.

The flexible design of PSALM supports joint training across multiple datasets and tasks, leading to improved performance and task generalization. PSALM achieves superior results on several benchmarks, such as RefCOCO/RefCOCO+/RefCOCOg, COCO Panoptic Segmentation, and COCO-Interactive, and further exhibits zero-shot capabilities on unseen tasks, such as open-vocabulary segmentation, generalized referring expression segmentation and video object segmentation, making a significant step towards a GPT moment in computer vision.

The differentiation of distinct objects of the same class with a similar appearance is particularly challenging and frequently causes such objects to be incorrectly assigned to a single instance. In the present work, we demonstrate that information on the 3D geometry of the observed scene can be used to mitigate this issue: We present a novel CNN-based method for panoptic segmentation which processes RGB images and depth maps given as input in separate network branches and fuses the resulting feature maps in a late fusion manner. Moreover, we propose a new depth-aware dice loss term which penalises the assignment of pixels to the same thing instance based on the difference between their associated distances to the camera. Experiments carried out on the Cityscapes dataset show that the proposed method reduces the number of objects that are erroneously merged into one thing instance and outperforms the method used as basis by 2.2% in terms of panoptic quality.</p></details> |  | None |

While SAM excels in generating spatially-aware masks, it's decoder falls short in recognizing object class information and tends to oversegment without additional guidance. Existing approaches address this limitation by using multi-stage techniques and employing separate models to generate class-aware prompts, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks. Our proposed method, PosSAM is an end-to-end model which leverages SAM's spatially rich features to produce instance-aware masks and harnesses CLIP's semantically discriminative features for effective instance classification. Specifically, we address the limitations of SAM and propose a novel Local Discriminative Pooling (LDP) module leveraging class-agnostic SAM and class-aware CLIP features for unbiased open-vocabulary classification. Furthermore, we introduce a Mask-Aware Selective Ensembling (MASE) algorithm that adaptively enhances the quality of generated masks and boosts the performance of open-vocabulary classification during inference for each image. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate our methods strong generalization properties across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial improvements over SOTA open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation methods. In both COCO to ADE20K and ADE20K to COCO settings, PosSAM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, 2.4 PQ and 4.6 PQ, respectively.

Concurrently, recent breakthroughs in visual representation learning have sparked a paradigm shift leading to the advent of large foundation models that can be trained with completely unlabeled images. In this work, we propose to leverage such task-agnostic image features to enable few-shot panoptic segmentation by presenting Segmenting Panoptic Information with Nearly 0 labels (SPINO). In detail, our method combines a DINOv2 backbone with lightweight network heads for semantic segmentation and boundary estimation. We show that our approach, albeit being trained with only ten annotated images, predicts high-quality pseudo-labels that can be used with any existing panoptic segmentation method. Notably, we demonstrate that SPINO achieves competitive results compared to fully supervised baselines while using less than 0.3% of the ground truth labels, paving the way for learning complex visual recognition tasks leveraging foundation models. To illustrate its general applicability, we further deploy SPINO on real-world robotic vision systems for both outdoor and indoor environments.

Our proposed Small, Versatile, and Mighty (SVM) network utilizes a pure convolutional architecture to fully unleash the efficiency and multi-tasking potentials of the range view representation. To boost detection performances, we first propose a range-view specific Perspective Centric Label Assignment (PCLA) strategy, and a novel View Adaptive Regression (VAR) module to further refine hard-to-predict box properties. In addition, our framework seamlessly integrates semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation tasks for the LiDAR point cloud, without extra modules. Among range-view-based methods, our model achieves new state-of-the-art detection performances on the Waymo Open Dataset. Especially, over 10 mAP improvement over convolutional counterparts can be obtained on the vehicle class. Our presented results for other tasks further reveal the multi-task capabilities of the proposed small but mighty framework.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking the Robustness of Panoptic Segmentation for Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15469v1)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise situational awareness is required for the safe decision-making of assisted and automated driving (AAD) functions. Panoptic segmentation is a promising perception technique to identify and categorise objects, impending hazards, and driveable space at a pixel level. While segmentation quality is generally associated with the quality of the camera data, a comprehensive understanding and modelling of this relationship are paramount for AAD system designers. Motivated by such a need, this work proposes a unifying pipeline to assess the robustness of panoptic segmentation models for AAD, correlating it with traditional image quality. The first step of the proposed pipeline involves generating degraded camera data that reflects real-world noise factors. To this end, 19 noise factors have been identified and implemented with 3 severity levels. Of these factors, this work proposes novel models for unfavourable light and snow. After applying the degradation models, three state-of-the-art CNN- and vision transformers (ViT)-based panoptic segmentation networks are used to analyse their robustness. The variations of the segmentation performance are then correlated to 8 selected image quality metrics. This research reveals that: 1) certain specific noise factors produce the highest impact on panoptic segmentation, i.e. droplets on lens and Gaussian noise; 2) the ViT-based panoptic segmentation backbones show better robustness to the considered noise factors; 3) some image quality metrics (i.e. LPIPS and CW-SSIM) correlate strongly with panoptic segmentation performance and therefore they can be used as predictive metrics for network performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generalizable Semantic Vision Query Generation for Zero-shot Panoptic and Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13697v1)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Panoptic Segmentation (ZPS) aims to recognize foreground instances and background stuff without images containing unseen categories in training. Due to the visual data sparsity and the difficulty of generalizing from seen to unseen categories, this task remains challenging. To better generalize to unseen classes, we propose Conditional tOken aligNment and Cycle trAnsiTion (CONCAT), to produce generalizable semantic vision queries. First, a feature extractor is trained by CON to link the vision and semantics for providing target queries. Formally, CON is proposed to align the semantic queries with the CLIP visual CLS token extracted from complete and masked images. To address the lack of unseen categories, a generator is required. However, one of the gaps in synthesizing pseudo vision queries, ie, vision queries for unseen categories, is describing fine-grained visual details through semantic embeddings. Therefore, we approach CAT to train the generator in semantic-vision and vision-semantic manners. In semantic-vision, visual query contrast is proposed to model the high granularity of vision by pulling the pseudo vision queries with the corresponding targets containing segments while pushing those without segments away. To ensure the generated queries retain semantic information, in vision-semantic, the pseudo vision queries are mapped back to semantic and supervised by real semantic embeddings. Experiments on ZPS achieve a 5.2% hPQ increase surpassing SOTA. We also examine inductive ZPS and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation and obtain comparative results while being 2 times faster in testing.</p></details> |  | None |

It explores how NeRFs adeptly infer 3D representations for both stationary and dynamic objects in a scene. This capability is pivotal for generating high-quality new viewpoints, completing missing scene details (inpainting), conducting comprehensive scene segmentation (panoptic segmentation), predicting 3D bounding boxes, editing 3D scenes, and extracting object-centric 3D models. A significant aspect of this study is the application of semantic labels as viewpoint-invariant functions, which effectively map spatial coordinates to a spectrum of semantic labels, thus facilitating the recognition of distinct objects within the scene. Overall, this survey highlights the progression and diverse applications of semantically-aware neural radiance fields in the context of visual scene interpretation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond the Label Itself: Latent Labels Enhance Semi-supervised Point Cloud Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08234v2)** | 2024-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the exorbitant expense of labeling autopilot datasets and the growing trend of utilizing unlabeled data, semi-supervised segmentation on point clouds becomes increasingly imperative. Intuitively, finding out more ``unspoken words'' (i.e., latent instance information) beyond the label itself should be helpful to improve performance. In this paper, we discover two types of latent labels behind the displayed label embedded in LiDAR and image data. First, in the LiDAR Branch, we propose a novel augmentation, Cylinder-Mix, which is able to augment more yet reliable samples for training. Second, in the Image Branch, we propose the Instance Position-scale Learning (IPSL) Module to learn and fuse the information of instance position and scale, which is from a 2D pre-trained detector and a type of latent label obtained from 3D to 2D projection. Finally, the two latent labels are embedded into the multi-modal panoptic segmentation network. The ablation of the IPSL module demonstrates its robust adaptability, and the experiments evaluated on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art method, LaserMix.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 11 tables</p></details> | None |

This approach can be trained using only local auxiliary tasks, thereby eliminating the resource-intensive instance-matching step during training. Moreover, our formulation can easily be adapted to the superpoint paradigm, further increasing its efficiency. This allows our model to process scenes with millions of points and thousands of objects in a single inference. Our method, called SuperCluster, achieves a new state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation performance for two indoor scanning datasets: $50.1$ PQ ($+7.8$) for S3DIS Area~5, and $58.7$ PQ ($+25.2$) for ScanNetV2. We also set the first state-of-the-art for two large-scale mobile mapping benchmarks: KITTI-360 and DALES.

We leverage a large multimodal model (LMM) to extract semantic nouns, a class-agnostic segmentation model to generate entity-level segmentation, and the proposed multi-modal feature fusion module to associate each semantic noun with its corresponding segmentation mask. Additionally, we introduce a strategy of encoding entity segmentation masks into a colormap, enabling the preservation of fine-grained predictions from features of high-resolution masks. This approach allows us to extract visual features from low-resolution images using the CLIP vision encoder in the LMM, which is more computationally efficient than existing approaches that use an additional encoder for high-resolution images. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on three tasks, including panoptic narrative grounding, referring expression segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

These technologies offer new dimensions of image analysis and generation, which are particularly relevant in the context of urban landscape reconstruction. This paper presents a novel workflow encapsulated within a prototype application, designed to leverage the synergies between advanced image segmentation and diffusion models for a comprehensive approach to urban design. Our methodology encompasses the OneFormer model for detailed image segmentation and the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) diffusion model, implemented through ControlNet, for generating images from textual descriptions. Validation results indicated a high degree of performance by the prototype application, showcasing significant accuracy in both object detection and text-to-image generation. This was evidenced by superior Intersection over Union (IoU) and CLIP scores across iterative evaluations for various categories of urban landscape features. Preliminary testing included utilising UrbanGenAI as an educational tool enhancing the learning experience in design pedagogy, and as a participatory instrument facilitating community-driven urban planning. Early results suggested that UrbanGenAI not only advances the technical frontiers of urban landscape reconstruction but also provides significant pedagogical and participatory planning benefits. The ongoing development of UrbanGenAI aims to further validate its effectiveness across broader contexts and integrate additional features such as real-time feedback mechanisms and 3D modelling capabilities.

CLIP models, particularly those incorporating vision transformers (ViTs), have exhibited remarkable generalization ability in zero-shot image classification. However, when transferring the vision-language alignment of CLIP from global image representation to local region representation for the open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks, CLIP ViTs suffer from the domain shift from full images to local image regions. In this paper, we embark on an in-depth analysis of the region-language alignment in CLIP models, which is essential for downstream open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks. Subsequently, we propose an approach named CLIPSelf, which adapts the image-level recognition ability of CLIP ViT to local image regions without needing any region-text pairs. CLIPSelf empowers ViTs to distill itself by aligning a region representation extracted from its dense feature map with the image-level representation of the corresponding image crop. With the enhanced CLIP ViTs, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on open-vocabulary object detection, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation across various benchmarks.

Such methods are able to segment scenes into arbitrary classes based on text descriptions provided during runtime. In this paper, we propose to the best of our knowledge the first algorithm for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation in 3D scenes. Our algorithm, Panoptic Vision-Language Feature Fields (PVLFF), learns a semantic feature field of the scene by distilling vision-language features from a pretrained 2D model, and jointly fits an instance feature field through contrastive learning using 2D instance segments on input frames. Despite not being trained on the target classes, our method achieves panoptic segmentation performance similar to the state-of-the-art closed-set 3D systems on the HyperSim, ScanNet and Replica dataset and additionally outperforms current 3D open-vocabulary systems in terms of semantic segmentation.

A recent advance proposes a panoptic 3D scene reconstruction task that performs both 3D reconstruction and 3D panoptic segmentation from a single image. Although having made substantial progress, recent works only focus on top-down approaches that fill 2D instances into 3D voxels according to estimated depth, which hinders their performance by two ambiguities. (1) instance-channel ambiguity: The variable ids of instances in each scene lead to ambiguity during filling voxel channels with 2D information, confusing the following 3D refinement. (2) voxel-reconstruction ambiguity: 2D-to-3D lifting with estimated single view depth only propagates 2D information onto the surface of 3D regions, leading to ambiguity during the reconstruction of regions behind the frontal view surface. In this paper, we propose BUOL, a Bottom-Up framework with Occupancy-aware Lifting to address the two issues for panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from a single image. For instance-channel ambiguity, a bottom-up framework lifts 2D information to 3D voxels based on deterministic semantic assignments rather than arbitrary instance id assignments. The 3D voxels are then refined and grouped into 3D instances according to the predicted 2D instance centers. For voxel-reconstruction ambiguity, the estimated multi-plane occupancy is leveraged together with depth to fill the whole regions of things and stuff. Our method shows a tremendous performance advantage over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic dataset 3D-Front and real-world dataset Matterport3D.

With HOI4D, we establish three benchmarking tasks to promote category-level HOI from 4D visual signals including semantic segmentation of 4D dynamic point cloud sequences, category-level object pose tracking, and egocentric action segmentation with diverse interaction targets. In-depth analysis shows HOI4D poses great challenges to existing methods and produces great research opportunities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised Universal Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17243v1)** | 2023-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several unsupervised image segmentation approaches have been proposed which eliminate the need for dense manually-annotated segmentation masks; current models separately handle either semantic segmentation (e.g., STEGO) or class-agnostic instance segmentation (e.g., CutLER), but not both (i.e., panoptic segmentation). We propose an Unsupervised Universal Segmentation model (U2Seg) adept at performing various image segmentation tasks -- instance, semantic and panoptic -- using a novel unified framework. U2Seg generates pseudo semantic labels for these segmentation tasks via leveraging self-supervised models followed by clustering; each cluster represents different semantic and/or instance membership of pixels. We then self-train the model on these pseudo semantic labels, yielding substantial performance gains over specialized methods tailored to each task: a +2.6 AP$^{\text{box}}$ boost vs. CutLER in unsupervised instance segmentation on COCO and a +7.0 PixelAcc increase (vs. STEGO) in unsupervised semantic segmentation on COCOStuff. Moreover, our method sets up a new baseline for unsupervised panoptic segmentation, which has not been previously explored. U2Seg is also a strong pretrained model for few-shot segmentation, surpassing CutLER by +5.0 AP$^{\text{mask}}$ when trained on a low-data regime, e.g., only 1% COCO labels. We hope our simple yet effective method can inspire more research on unsupervised universal image segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Scalable SoftGroup for 3D Instance Segmentation on Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08263v3)** | 2023-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a network referred to as SoftGroup for accurate and scalable 3D instance segmentation. Existing state-of-the-art methods produce hard semantic predictions followed by grouping instance segmentation results. Unfortunately, errors stemming from hard decisions propagate into the grouping, resulting in poor overlap between predicted instances and ground truth and substantial false positives. To address the abovementioned problems, SoftGroup allows each point to be associated with multiple classes to mitigate the uncertainty stemming from semantic prediction. It also suppresses false positive instances by learning to categorize them as background. Regarding scalability, the existing fast methods require computational time on the order of tens of seconds on large-scale scenes, which is unsatisfactory and far from applicable for real-time. Our finding is that the $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$-NN) module, which serves as the prerequisite of grouping, introduces a computational bottleneck. SoftGroup is extended to resolve this computational bottleneck, referred to as SoftGroup++. The proposed SoftGroup++ reduces time complexity with octree $k$-NN and reduces search space with class-aware pyramid scaling and late devoxelization. Experimental results on various indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the efficacy and generality of the proposed SoftGroup and SoftGroup++. Their performances surpass the best-performing baseline by a large margin (6\% $\sim$ 16\%) in terms of AP$_{50}$. On datasets with large-scale scenes, SoftGroup++ achieves a 6$\times$ speed boost on average compared to SoftGroup. Furthermore, SoftGroup can be extended to perform object detection and panoptic segmentation with nontrivial improvements over existing methods.

Much prior art was dedicated to domain-adaptive semantic segmentation in the synthetic-to-real context. Despite being a crucial output of the perception stack, panoptic segmentation has been largely overlooked by the domain adaptation community. Therefore, we revisit well-performing domain adaptation strategies from other fields, adapt them to panoptic segmentation, and show that they can effectively enhance panoptic domain adaptation. Further, we study the panoptic network design and propose a novel architecture (EDAPS) designed explicitly for domain-adaptive panoptic segmentation. It uses a shared, domain-robust transformer encoder to facilitate the joint adaptation of semantic and instance features, but task-specific decoders tailored for the specific requirements of both domain-adaptive semantic and instance segmentation. As a result, the performance gap seen in challenging panoptic benchmarks is substantially narrowed. EDAPS significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance for panoptic segmentation UDA by a large margin of 20% on SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes and even 72% on the more challenging SYNTHIA-to-Mapillary Vistas.

Unlike previous methods that model video segmentation in an end-to-end manner, our approach decouples video segmentation into three cascaded sub-tasks: segmentation, tracking, and refinement. This decoupling design allows for simpler and more effective modeling of the spatio-temporal representations of objects, especially in complex scenes and long videos. Accordingly, we introduce two novel components: the referring tracker and the temporal refiner. These components track objects frame by frame and model spatio-temporal representations based on pre-aligned features. To improve the tracking capability of DVIS, we propose a denoising training strategy and introduce contrastive learning, resulting in a more robust framework named DVIS++. Furthermore, we evaluate DVIS++ in various settings, including open vocabulary and using a frozen pre-trained backbone. By integrating CLIP with DVIS++, we present OV-DVIS++, the first open-vocabulary universal video segmentation framework. We conduct extensive experiments on six mainstream benchmarks, including the VIS, VSS, and VPS datasets. Using a unified architecture, DVIS++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialized methods on these benchmarks in both close- and open-vocabulary settings.

Although there are multiple benchmark datasets available in the community, none of them is dedicated for human-centric scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce SportsSloMo, a benchmark consisting of more than 130K video clips and 1M video frames of high-resolution ($\geq$720p) slow-motion sports videos crawled from YouTube. We re-train several state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, and the results show a decrease in their accuracy compared to other datasets. It highlights the difficulty of our benchmark and suggests that it poses significant challenges even for the best-performing methods, as human bodies are highly deformable and occlusions are frequent in sports videos. To improve the accuracy, we introduce two loss terms considering the human-aware priors, where we add auxiliary supervision to panoptic segmentation and human keypoints detection, respectively. The loss terms are model agnostic and can be easily plugged into any video frame interpolation approaches. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed loss terms, leading to consistent performance improvement over 5 existing models, which establish strong baseline models on our benchmark.

Existing methods predominantly utilize the trained instance embedding to keep the consistency of panoptic segmentation. However, they inevitably struggle to cope with the challenges of small objects, similar appearance but inconsistent identities, occlusion, and strong instance contour deformations. To address these problems, we present HybridTracker, a lightweight and joint tracking model attempting to eliminate the limitations of the single tracker. HybridTracker performs pixel tracker and instance tracker in parallel to obtain the association matrices, which are fused into a matching matrix. In the instance tracker, we design a differentiable matching layer, ensuring the stability of inter-frame matching. In the pixel tracker, we compute the dice coefficient of the same instance of different frames given the estimated optical flow, forming the Intersection Over Union (IoU) matrix. We additionally propose mutual check and temporal consistency constraints during inference to settle the occlusion and contour deformation challenges. Comprehensive experiments show that HybridTracker achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods on Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we revisit pure convolution model and propose a novel panoptic architecture named MaskConver. MaskConver proposes to fully unify things and stuff representation by predicting their centers. To that extent, it creates a lightweight class embedding module that can break the ties when multiple centers co-exist in the same location. Furthermore, our study shows that the decoder design is critical in ensuring that the model has sufficient context for accurate detection and segmentation. We introduce a powerful ConvNeXt-UNet decoder that closes the performance gap between convolution- and transformerbased models. With ResNet50 backbone, our MaskConver achieves 53.6% PQ on the COCO panoptic val set, outperforming the modern convolution-based model, Panoptic FCN, by 9.3% as well as transformer-based models such as Mask2Former (+1.7% PQ) and kMaX-DeepLab (+0.6% PQ). Additionally, MaskConver with a MobileNet backbone reaches 37.2% PQ, improving over Panoptic-DeepLab by +6.4% under the same FLOPs/latency constraints. A further optimized version of MaskConver achieves 29.7% PQ, while running in real-time on mobile devices.

| **[Aligning and Prompting Everything All at Once for Universal Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02153v1)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models have been explored recently to build general-purpose vision systems. However, predominant paradigms, driven by casting instance-level tasks as an object-word alignment, bring heavy cross-modality interaction, which is not effective in prompting object detection and visual grounding. Another line of work that focuses on pixel-level tasks often encounters a large annotation gap of things and stuff, and suffers from mutual interference between foreground-object and background-class segmentation. In stark contrast to the prevailing methods, we present APE, a universal visual perception model for aligning and prompting everything all at once in an image to perform diverse tasks, i.e., detection, segmentation, and grounding, as an instance-level sentence-object matching paradigm. Specifically, APE advances the convergence of detection and grounding by reformulating language-guided grounding as open-vocabulary detection, which efficiently scales up model prompting to thousands of category vocabularies and region descriptions while maintaining the effectiveness of cross-modality fusion. To bridge the granularity gap of different pixel-level tasks, APE equalizes semantic and panoptic segmentation to proxy instance learning by considering any isolated regions as individual instances. APE aligns vision and language representation on broad data with natural and challenging characteristics all at once without task-specific fine-tuning. The extensive experiments on over 160 datasets demonstrate that, with only one-suit of weights, APE outperforms (or is on par with) the state-of-the-art models, proving that an effective yet universal perception for anything aligning and prompting is indeed feasible.

More precisely, semantic areas, object instances, and semantic parts are predicted simultaneously. In this paper, we present our Joint Panoptic Part Fusion (JPPF) that combines the three individual segmentations effectively to obtain a panoptic-part segmentation. Two aspects are of utmost importance for this: First, a unified model for the three problems is desired that allows for mutually improved and consistent representation learning. Second, balancing the combination so that it gives equal importance to all individual results during fusion. Our proposed JPPF is parameter-free and dynamically balances its input. The method is evaluated and compared on the Cityscapes Panoptic Parts (CPP) and Pascal Panoptic Parts (PPP) datasets in terms of PartPQ and Part-Whole Quality (PWQ). In extensive experiments, we verify the importance of our fair fusion, highlight its most significant impact for areas that can be further segmented into parts, and demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our design without fine-tuning on 5 additional datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Springer Nature Computer Science. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2212.07671</p></details> | None |
| **[Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17058v1)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Towards building comprehensive real-world visual perception systems, we propose and study a new problem called panoptic scene graph generation (PVSG). PVSG relates to the existing video scene graph generation (VidSGG) problem, which focuses on temporal interactions between humans and objects grounded with bounding boxes in videos. However, the limitation of bounding boxes in detecting non-rigid objects and backgrounds often causes VidSGG to miss key details crucial for comprehensive video understanding. In contrast, PVSG requires nodes in scene graphs to be grounded by more precise, pixel-level segmentation masks, which facilitate holistic scene understanding. To advance research in this new area, we contribute the PVSG dataset, which consists of 400 videos (289 third-person + 111 egocentric videos) with a total of 150K frames labeled with panoptic segmentation masks as well as fine, temporal scene graphs. We also provide a variety of baseline methods and share useful design practices for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2023.

Thereby, the similarity of all segmentation tasks and the implicit relationship between them have not been utilized effectively. This paper presents a unified, simple, and effective model addressing all these tasks jointly. The model, named OneFormer3D, performs instance and semantic segmentation consistently, using a group of learnable kernels, where each kernel is responsible for generating a mask for either an instance or a semantic category. These kernels are trained with a transformer-based decoder with unified instance and semantic queries passed as an input. Such a design enables training a model end-to-end in a single run, so that it achieves top performance on all three segmentation tasks simultaneously. Specifically, our OneFormer3D ranks 1st and sets a new state-of-the-art (+2.1 mAP50) in the ScanNet test leaderboard. We also demonstrate the state-of-the-art results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of ScanNet (+21 PQ), ScanNet200 (+3.8 mAP50), and S3DIS (+0.8 mIoU) datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches utilize only LiDAR inputs which convey limited information in regions with point sparsity. This problem can, however, be mitigated by utilizing RGB camera images which offer appearance-based information that can reinforce the geometry-based LiDAR features. Motivated by this, we propose 4D-Former: a novel method for 4D panoptic segmentation which leverages both LiDAR and image modalities, and predicts semantic masks as well as temporally consistent object masks for the input point-cloud sequence. We encode semantic classes and objects using a set of concise queries which absorb feature information from both data modalities. Additionally, we propose a learned mechanism to associate object tracks over time which reasons over both appearance and spatial location. We apply 4D-Former to the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets where it achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CoRL 2023</p></details> | None |

It plays a crucial role in domains of medical image analysis, self-driving vehicles, and robotics by providing a comprehensive understanding of visual environments. Traditionally, deep learning panoptic segmentation models have relied on dense and accurately annotated training data, which is expensive and time consuming to obtain. Recent advancements in self-supervised learning approaches have shown great potential in leveraging synthetic and unlabelled data to generate pseudo-labels using self-training to improve the performance of instance and semantic segmentation models. The three available methods for self-supervised panoptic segmentation use proposal-based transformer architectures which are computationally expensive, complicated and engineered for specific tasks. The aim of this work is to develop a framework to perform embedding-based self-supervised panoptic segmentation using self-training in a synthetic-to-real domain adaptation problem setting.</p></details> |  | None |

The recent proposal-free methods accelerate the algorithm, but their effectiveness and efficiency are still limited owing to the difficulty of modeling non-existent instance centers and the costly center-based clustering modules. To achieve accurate and real-time LiDAR panoptic segmentation, a novel center focusing network (CFNet) is introduced. Specifically, the center focusing feature encoding (CFFE) is proposed to explicitly understand the relationships between the original LiDAR points and virtual instance centers by shifting the LiDAR points and filling in the center points. Moreover, to leverage the redundantly detected centers, a fast center deduplication module (CDM) is proposed to select only one center for each instance. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes panoptic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our CFNet outperforms all existing methods by a large margin and is 1.6 times faster than the most efficient method.

Central to our approach is a novel scene node data structure that stores the information of each object in a unified fashion, allowing online interaction in both intra- and cross-scene settings. By incorporating a differentiable neural network along with the associated bounding box and semantic features, the proposed structure guarantees user-friendly interaction on independent objects to scale up novel view simulation. Objects in the scene can be queried, added, duplicated, deleted, transformed, or swapped simply through mouse/keyboard controls or language instructions. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, where scaled realistic simulation can be achieved through interactive editing and compositional rendering, with color images, depth images, and panoptic segmentation masks generated in a 3D consistent manner.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we re-think this approach and propose a surprisingly simple yet effective detection-centric network for both LPS and tracking. Our network is modular by design and optimized for all aspects of both the panoptic segmentation and tracking task. One of the core components of our network is the object instance detection branch, which we train using point-level (modal) annotations, as available in segmentation-centric datasets. In the absence of amodal (cuboid) annotations, we regress modal centroids and object extent using trajectory-level supervision that provides information about object size, which cannot be inferred from single scans due to occlusions and the sparse nature of the lidar data. We obtain fine-grained instance segments by learning to associate lidar points with detected centroids. We evaluate our method on several 3D/4D LPS benchmarks and observe that our model establishes a new state-of-the-art among open-sourced models, outperforming recent query-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS ...</summary><p>IROS 2023.

However, the performance of panoptic segmentation is severely impacted in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) objects i.e. categories of objects that deviate from the training distribution. To overcome this limitation, we propose Panoptic Out-of Distribution Segmentation for joint pixel-level semantic in-distribution and out-of-distribution classification with instance prediction. We extend two established panoptic segmentation benchmarks, Cityscapes and BDD100K, with out-of-distribution instance segmentation annotations, propose suitable evaluation metrics, and present multiple strong baselines. Importantly, we propose the novel PoDS architecture with a shared backbone, an OOD contextual module for learning global and local OOD object cues, and dual symmetrical decoders with task-specific heads that employ our alignment-mismatch strategy for better OOD generalization. Combined with our data augmentation strategy, this approach facilitates progressive learning of out-of-distribution objects while maintaining in-distribution performance. We perform extensive evaluations that demonstrate that our proposed PoDS network effectively addresses the main challenges and substantially outperforms the baselines. We make the dataset, code, and trained models publicly available at http://pods.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  | None |

As permutations of instance IDs are also valid solutions, the task requires learning of high-dimensional one-to-many mapping. As a result, state-of-the-art approaches use customized architectures and task-specific loss functions. We formulate panoptic segmentation as a discrete data generation problem, without relying on inductive bias of the task. A diffusion model is proposed to model panoptic masks, with a simple architecture and generic loss function. By simply adding past predictions as a conditioning signal, our method is capable of modeling video (in a streaming setting) and thereby learns to track object instances automatically.

Each dimension is quantized to a small set of fixed values, leading to an (implicit) codebook given by the product of these sets. By appropriately choosing the number of dimensions and values each dimension can take, we obtain the same codebook size as in VQ. On top of such discrete representations, we can train the same models that have been trained on VQ-VAE representations. For example, autoregressive and masked transformer models for image generation, multimodal generation, and dense prediction computer vision tasks. Concretely, we employ FSQ with MaskGIT for image generation, and with UViM for depth estimation, colorization, and panoptic segmentation. Despite the much simpler design of FSQ, we obtain competitive performance in all these tasks. We emphasize that FSQ does not suffer from codebook collapse and does not need the complex machinery employed in VQ (commitment losses, codebook reseeding, code splitting, entropy penalties, etc.) to learn expressive discrete representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/fsq</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/google-research/google-research) |

Precision agriculture, where data analysis enables interventions to be precisely targeted, has many possible applications. Precision spraying, for example, can limit the application of herbicide only to weeds, or limit the application of fertiliser only to undernourished crops, instead of spraying the entire field. The approach promises to maximise yields, whilst minimising resource use and harms to the surrounding environment. To this end, we propose a hierarchical panoptic segmentation method to simultaneously identify indicators of plant growth and locate weeds within an image. We adapt Mask2Former, a state-of-the-art architecture for panoptic segmentation, to predict crop, weed and leaf masks. We achieve a PQ{\dag} of 75.99. Additionally, we explore approaches to make the architecture more compact and therefore more suitable for time and compute constrained applications.

It comprises two novel designs: 1. recurrent cross-attention clustering, which reformulates the cross-attention mechanism in Transformer and enables recursive updates of cluster centers to facilitate strong representation learning; and 2. feature dispatching, which uses the updated cluster centers to redistribute image features through similarity-based metrics, resulting in a transparent pipeline. This elegant design streamlines an explainable and transferable workflow, capable of tackling heterogeneous vision tasks (i.e., image classification, object detection, and image segmentation) with varying levels of clustering granularity (i.e., image-, box-, and pixel-level). Empirical results demonstrate that CLUSTERFORMER outperforms various well-known specialized architectures, achieving 83.41% top-1 acc. over ImageNet-1K for image classification, 54.2% and 47.0% mAP over MS COCO for object detection and instance segmentation, 52.4% mIoU over ADE20K for semantic segmentation, and 55.8% PQ over COCO Panoptic for panoptic segmentation.

We observe that the driving scenario is symmetric to rotations on the ground plane. Therefore, rotation-equivariance could provide better generalization and more robust feature learning. Specifically, we review the object instance clustering strategies and restate the centerness-based approach and the offset-based approach as the prediction of invariant scalar fields and equivariant vector fields. Other sub-tasks are also unified from this perspective, and different invariant and equivariant layers are designed to facilitate their predictions. Through evaluation on the standard 4D panoptic segmentation benchmark of SemanticKITTI, we show that our equivariant models achieve higher accuracy with lower computational costs compared to their non-equivariant counterparts. Moreover, our method sets the new state-of-the-art performance and achieves 1st place on the SemanticKITTI 4D Panoptic Segmentation leaderboard.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages.

However, reasoning individually about each pixel without considering their contextual semantics results in high uncertainty around the objects' boundaries and numerous false positives. We propose a paradigm change by shifting from a per-pixel classification to a mask classification. Our mask-based method, Mask2Anomaly, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating a mask-classification architecture to jointly address anomaly segmentation, open-set semantic segmentation, and open-set panoptic segmentation. Mask2Anomaly includes several technical novelties that are designed to improve the detection of anomalies/unknown objects: i) a global masked attention module to focus individually on the foreground and background regions; ii) a mask contrastive learning that maximizes the margin between an anomaly and known classes; iii) a mask refinement solution to reduce false positives; and iv) a novel approach to mine unknown instances based on the mask-architecture properties.

All of them have accurate 3D measurements but lack color and texture information. RGB images are a natural complement to these point cloud views and fully utilizing the comprehensive information of them benefits more robust perceptions. In this paper, we present a unified multi-modal LiDAR segmentation network, termed UniSeg, which leverages the information of RGB images and three views of the point cloud, and accomplishes semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation simultaneously. Specifically, we first design the Learnable cross-Modal Association (LMA) module to automatically fuse voxel-view and range-view features with image features, which fully utilize the rich semantic information of images and are robust to calibration errors. Then, the enhanced voxel-view and range-view features are transformed to the point space,where three views of point cloud features are further fused adaptively by the Learnable cross-View Association module (LVA). Notably, UniSeg achieves promising results in three public benchmarks, i.e., SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset (WOD); it ranks 1st on two challenges of two benchmarks, including the LiDAR semantic segmentation challenge of nuScenes and panoptic segmentation challenges of SemanticKITTI.

These challenges result in specialized neural network architectures tailored for SITS analysis. The field has witnessed promising results achieved by pioneering researchers, but transferring the latest advances or established paradigms from Computer Vision (CV) to SITS is still highly challenging due to the existing suboptimal representation learning framework. In this paper, we develop a novel perspective of SITS processing as a direct set prediction problem, inspired by the recent trend in adopting query-based transformer decoders to streamline the object detection or image segmentation pipeline. We further propose to decompose the representation learning process of SITS into three explicit steps: collect-update-distribute, which is computationally efficient and suits for irregularly-sampled and asynchronous temporal satellite observations. Facilitated by the unique reformulation, our proposed temporal learning backbone of SITS, initially pre-trained on the resource efficient pixel-set format and then fine-tuned on the downstream dense prediction tasks, has attained new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the PASTIS benchmark dataset. Specifically, the clear separation between temporal and spatial components in the semantic/panoptic segmentation pipeline of SITS makes us leverage the latest advances in CV, such as the universal image segmentation architecture, resulting in a noticeable 2.5 points increase in mIoU and 8.8 points increase in PQ, respectively, compared to the best scores reported so far.</p></details> |  | None |

This impedes extensions of end-to-end algorithms to new video segmentation tasks, especially in large-vocabulary settings. To 'track anything' without training on video data for every individual task, we develop a decoupled video segmentation approach (DEVA), composed of task-specific image-level segmentation and class/task-agnostic bi-directional temporal propagation. Due to this design, we only need an image-level model for the target task (which is cheaper to train) and a universal temporal propagation model which is trained once and generalizes across tasks. To effectively combine these two modules, we use bi-directional propagation for (semi-)online fusion of segmentation hypotheses from different frames to generate a coherent segmentation. We show that this decoupled formulation compares favorably to end-to-end approaches in several data-scarce tasks including large-vocabulary video panoptic segmentation, open-world video segmentation, referring video segmentation, and unsupervised video object segmentation.

Taking a NeRF pretrained from multi-view RGB images as input, Instance NeRF can learn 3D instance segmentation of a given scene, represented as an instance field component of the NeRF model. To this end, we adopt a 3D proposal-based mask prediction network on the sampled volumetric features from NeRF, which generates discrete 3D instance masks. The coarse 3D mask prediction is then projected to image space to match 2D segmentation masks from different views generated by existing panoptic segmentation models, which are used to supervise the training of the instance field. Notably, beyond generating consistent 2D segmentation maps from novel views, Instance NeRF can query instance information at any 3D point, which greatly enhances NeRF object segmentation and manipulation. Our method is also one of the first to achieve such results in pure inference.

While impressive performance gains have been witnessed from recent kernel-based dynamic upsamplers such as CARAFE, FADE, and SAPA, they introduce much workload, mostly due to the time-consuming dynamic convolution and the additional sub-network used to generate dynamic kernels. Further, the need for high-res feature guidance of FADE and SAPA somehow limits their application scenarios. To address these concerns, we bypass dynamic convolution and formulate upsampling from the perspective of point sampling, which is more resource-efficient and can be easily implemented with the standard built-in function in PyTorch. We first showcase a naive design, and then demonstrate how to strengthen its upsampling behavior step by step towards our new upsampler, DySample.

Even for state-of-the-art approaches, this inevitably enforces decisions that systematically lead to wrong predictions for objects outside the training categories. However, robustness against out-of-distribution samples and corner cases is crucial in safety-critical settings to avoid dangerous consequences. Since real-world datasets cannot contain enough data points to adequately sample the long tail of the underlying distribution, models must be able to deal with unseen and unknown scenarios as well. Previous methods targeted this by re-identifying already-seen unlabeled objects. In this work, we propose the necessary step to extend segmentation with a new setting which we term holistic segmentation. Holistic segmentation aims to identify and separate objects of unseen, unknown categories into instances without any prior knowledge about them while performing panoptic segmentation of known classes. We tackle this new problem with U3HS, which finds unknowns as highly uncertain regions and clusters their corresponding instance-aware embeddings into individual objects. By doing so, for the first time in panoptic segmentation with unknown objects, our U3HS is trained without unknown categories, reducing assumptions and leaving the settings as unconstrained as in real-life scenarios. Extensive experiments on public data from MS COCO, Cityscapes, and Lost&Found demonstrate the effectiveness of U3HS for this new, challenging, and assumptions-free setting called holistic segmentation.

We present the first maritime panoptic obstacle detection benchmark LaRS, featuring scenes from Lakes, Rivers and Seas. Our major contribution is the new dataset, which boasts the largest diversity in recording locations, scene types, obstacle classes, and acquisition conditions among the related datasets. LaRS is composed of over 4000 per-pixel labeled key frames with nine preceding frames to allow utilization of the temporal texture, amounting to over 40k frames. Each key frame is annotated with 8 thing, 3 stuff classes and 19 global scene attributes. We report the results of 27 semantic and panoptic segmentation methods, along with several performance insights and future research directions. To enable objective evaluation, we have implemented an online evaluation server.

| **[Unified Open-Vocabulary Dense Visual Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08238v2)** | 2023-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, open-vocabulary (OV) dense visual prediction (such as OV object detection, semantic, instance and panoptic segmentations) has attracted increasing research attention. However, most of existing approaches are task-specific and individually tackle each task. In this paper, we propose a Unified Open-Vocabulary Network (UOVN) to jointly address four common dense prediction tasks. Compared with separate models, a unified network is more desirable for diverse industrial applications. Moreover, OV dense prediction training data is relatively less. Separate networks can only leverage task-relevant training data, while a unified approach can integrate diverse training data to boost individual tasks. We address two major challenges in unified OV prediction. Firstly, unlike unified methods for fixed-set predictions, OV networks are usually trained with multi-modal data. Therefore, we propose a multi-modal, multi-scale and multi-task (MMM) decoding mechanism to better leverage multi-modal data. Secondly, because UOVN uses data from different tasks for training, there are significant domain and task gaps. We present a UOVN training mechanism to reduce such gaps. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our UOVN.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Review of Panoptic Segmentation for Mobile Mapping Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13980v2)** | 2023-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D point cloud panoptic segmentation is the combined task to (i) assign each point to a semantic class and (ii) separate the points in each class into object instances. Recently there has been an increased interest in such comprehensive 3D scene understanding, building on the rapid advances of semantic segmentation due to the advent of deep 3D neural networks. Yet, to date there is very little work about panoptic segmentation of outdoor mobile-mapping data, and no systematic comparisons. The present paper tries to close that gap. It reviews the building blocks needed to assemble a panoptic segmentation pipeline and the related literature. Moreover, a modular pipeline is set up to perform comprehensive, systematic experiments to assess the state of panoptic segmentation in the context of street mapping. As a byproduct, we also provide the first public dataset for that task, by extending the NPM3D dataset to include instance labels. That dataset and our source code are publicly available. We discuss which adaptations are need to adapt current panoptic segmentation methods to outdoor scenes and large objects. Our study finds that for mobile mapping data, KPConv performs best but is slower, while PointNet++ is fastest but performs significantly worse. Sparse CNNs are in between. Regardless of the backbone, Instance segmentation by clustering embedding features is better than using shifted coordinates.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent works pursue unified frameworks to tackle this challenge but mostly still treat it as two individual learning tasks, which limits their potential for exploring cross-domain information. We propose a deeply unified framework for depth-aware panoptic segmentation, which performs joint segmentation and depth estimation both in a per-segment manner with identical object queries. To narrow the gap between the two tasks, we further design a geometric query enhancement method, which is able to integrate scene geometry into object queries using latent representations. In addition, we propose a bi-directional guidance learning approach to facilitate cross-task feature learning by taking advantage of their mutual relations. Our method sets the new state of the art for depth-aware panoptic segmentation on both Cityscapes-DVPS and SemKITTI-DVPS datasets. Moreover, our guidance learning approach is shown to deliver performance improvement even under incomplete supervision labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICCV 2023</p></details> | None |

In this task, we notice that images could provide rich texture, color, and discriminative information, which can complement LiDAR data for evident performance improvement, but their fusion remains a challenging problem. To this end, we propose LCPS, the first LiDAR-Camera Panoptic Segmentation network. In our approach, we conduct LiDAR-Camera fusion in three stages: 1) an Asynchronous Compensation Pixel Alignment (ACPA) module that calibrates the coordinate misalignment caused by asynchronous problems between sensors; 2) a Semantic-Aware Region Alignment (SARA) module that extends the one-to-one point-pixel mapping to one-to-many semantic relations; 3) a Point-to-Voxel feature Propagation (PVP) module that integrates both geometric and semantic fusion information for the entire point cloud. Our fusion strategy improves about 6.9% PQ performance over the LiDAR-only baseline on NuScenes dataset. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel framework.

To address the lack of class-specific information in SAM-generated masks, we propose a novel framework, called FoodSAM. This innovative approach integrates the coarse semantic mask with SAM-generated masks to enhance semantic segmentation quality. Besides, we recognize that the ingredients in food can be supposed as independent individuals, which motivated us to perform instance segmentation on food images. Furthermore, FoodSAM extends its zero-shot capability to encompass panoptic segmentation by incorporating an object detector, which renders FoodSAM to effectively capture non-food object information. Drawing inspiration from the recent success of promptable segmentation, we also extend FoodSAM to promptable segmentation, supporting various prompt variants. Consequently, FoodSAM emerges as an all-encompassing solution capable of segmenting food items at multiple levels of granularity. Remarkably, this pioneering framework stands as the first-ever work to achieve instance, panoptic, and promptable segmentation on food images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility and impressing performance of FoodSAM, validating SAM's potential as a prominent and influential tool within the domain of food image segmentation.

Despite the adoption of robots to assist medical staff in challenging tasks such as complex surgeries, human expertise is still indispensable. The next generation of autonomous healthcare robots hinges on their capacity to perceive and understand their complex and frenetic environments. While deep learning models are increasingly used for this purpose, they require extensive annotated training data which is impractical to obtain in real-world healthcare settings. To bridge this gap, we present Syn-Mediverse, the first hyper-realistic multimodal synthetic dataset of diverse healthcare facilities. Syn-Mediverse contains over \num{48000} images from a simulated industry-standard optical tracking camera and provides more than 1.5M annotations spanning five different scene understanding tasks including depth estimation, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. We demonstrate the complexity of our dataset by evaluating the performance on a broad range of state-of-the-art baselines for each task. To further advance research on scene understanding of healthcare facilities, along with the public dataset we provide an online evaluation benchmark available at \url{http://syn-mediverse.cs.uni-freiburg.de}</p></details> |  | None |

While much progress has been made, few works focus on the real-time application of panoptic segmentation methods. In this paper, we revisit the recently introduced K-Net architecture. We propose vital changes to the architecture, training, and inference procedure, which massively decrease latency and improve performance. Our resulting RT-K-Net sets a new state-of-the-art performance for real-time panoptic segmentation methods on the Cityscapes dataset and shows promising results on the challenging Mapillary Vistas dataset. On Cityscapes, RT-K-Net reaches 60.2 % PQ with an average inference time of 32 ms for full resolution 1024x2048 pixel images on a single Titan RTX GPU.

In this paper, we present an effective method, namely Point2Mask, to achieve high-quality panoptic prediction using only a single random point annotation per target for training. Specifically, we formulate the panoptic pseudo-mask generation as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem, where each ground-truth (gt) point label and pixel sample are defined as the label supplier and consumer, respectively. The transportation cost is calculated by the introduced task-oriented maps, which focus on the category-wise and instance-wise differences among the various thing and stuff targets. Furthermore, a centroid-based scheme is proposed to set the accurate unit number for each gt point supplier. Hence, the pseudo-mask generation is converted into finding the optimal transport plan at a globally minimal transportation cost, which can be solved via the Sinkhorn-Knopp Iteration. Experimental results on Pascal VOC and COCO demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed Point2Mask approach to point-supervised panoptic segmentation.

| **[Lowis3D: Language-Driven Open-World Instance-Level 3D Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00353v1)** | 2023-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-world instance-level scene understanding aims to locate and recognize unseen object categories that are not present in the annotated dataset. This task is challenging because the model needs to both localize novel 3D objects and infer their semantic categories. A key factor for the recent progress in 2D open-world perception is the availability of large-scale image-text pairs from the Internet, which cover a wide range of vocabulary concepts. However, this success is hard to replicate in 3D scenarios due to the scarcity of 3D-text pairs. To address this challenge, we propose to harness pre-trained vision-language (VL) foundation models that encode extensive knowledge from image-text pairs to generate captions for multi-view images of 3D scenes. This allows us to establish explicit associations between 3D shapes and semantic-rich captions. Moreover, to enhance the fine-grained visual-semantic representation learning from captions for object-level categorization, we design hierarchical point-caption association methods to learn semantic-aware embeddings that exploit the 3D geometry between 3D points and multi-view images. In addition, to tackle the localization challenge for novel classes in the open-world setting, we develop debiased instance localization, which involves training object grouping modules on unlabeled data using instance-level pseudo supervision. This significantly improves the generalization capabilities of instance grouping and thus the ability to accurately locate novel objects. We conduct extensive experiments on 3D semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks, covering indoor and outdoor scenes across three datasets. Our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin in semantic segmentation (e.g. 34.5%$\sim$65.3%), instance segmentation (e.g. 21.8%$\sim$54.0%) and panoptic segmentation (e.g. 14.7%$\sim$43.3%).

The generated dynamic queries, named modulated queries, better capture the prior of object locations and categories in the different images.

However, trained with scratch transformers, DETR needs large-scale training data and an extreme long training schedule even on COCO dataset. Inspired by the great success of pre-training transformers in natural language processing, we propose a novel pretext task named random query patch detection in Unsupervised Pre-training DETR (UP-DETR). Specifically, we randomly crop patches from the given image and then feed them as queries to the decoder. The model is pre-trained to detect these query patches from the input image. During the pre-training, we address two critical issues: multi-task learning and multi-query localization. (1) To trade off classification and localization preferences in the pretext task, we find that freezing the CNN backbone is the prerequisite for the success of pre-training transformers. (2) To perform multi-query localization, we develop UP-DETR with multi-query patch detection with attention mask. Besides, UP-DETR also provides a unified perspective for fine-tuning object detection and one-shot detection tasks. In our experiments, UP-DETR significantly boosts the performance of DETR with faster convergence and higher average precision on object detection, one-shot detection and panoptic segmentation.

| **[Betrayed by Captions: Joint Caption Grounding and Generation for Open Vocabulary Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00805v2)** | 2023-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we focus on open vocabulary instance segmentation to expand a segmentation model to classify and segment instance-level novel categories. Previous approaches have relied on massive caption datasets and complex pipelines to establish one-to-one mappings between image regions and words in captions. However, such methods build noisy supervision by matching non-visible words to image regions, such as adjectives and verbs. Meanwhile, context words are also important for inferring the existence of novel objects as they show high inter-correlations with novel categories. To overcome these limitations, we devise a joint \textbf{Caption Grounding and Generation (CGG)} framework, which incorporates a novel grounding loss that only focuses on matching object nouns to improve learning efficiency. We also introduce a caption generation head that enables additional supervision and contextual modeling as a complementation to the grounding loss. Our analysis and results demonstrate that grounding and generation components complement each other, significantly enhancing the segmentation performance for novel classes. Experiments on the COCO dataset with two settings: Open Vocabulary Instance Segmentation (OVIS) and Open Set Panoptic Segmentation (OSPS) demonstrate the superiority of the CGG. Specifically, CGG achieves a substantial improvement of 6.8% mAP for novel classes without extra data on the OVIS task and 15% PQ improvements for novel classes on the OSPS benchmark.</p></details> | ICCV-2023 | None |
| **[On Point Affiliation in Feature Upsampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08198v1)** | 2023-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the notion of point affiliation into feature upsampling. By abstracting a feature map into non-overlapped semantic clusters formed by points of identical semantic meaning, feature upsampling can be viewed as point affiliation -- designating a semantic cluster for each upsampled point. In the framework of kernel-based dynamic upsampling, we show that an upsampled point can resort to its low-res decoder neighbors and high-res encoder point to reason the affiliation, conditioned on the mutual similarity between them. We therefore present a generic formulation for generating similarity-aware upsampling kernels and prove that such kernels encourage not only semantic smoothness but also boundary sharpness. This formulation constitutes a novel, lightweight, and universal upsampling solution, Similarity-Aware Point Affiliation (SAPA). We show its working mechanism via our preliminary designs with window-shape kernel. After probing the limitations of the designs on object detection, we reveal additional insights for upsampling, leading to SAPA with the dynamic kernel shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAPA outperforms prior upsamplers and invites consistent performance improvements on a number of dense prediction tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, image matting, and depth estimation.

Traditional closed-vocabulary segmentation methods are not able to characterize novel objects, whereas several recent open-vocabulary attempts obtain unsatisfactory results, i.e., notable performance reduction on the closed vocabulary and massive demand for extra data. To this end, we propose OPSNet, an omnipotent and data-efficient framework for Open-vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation. Specifically, the exquisitely designed Embedding Modulation module, together with several meticulous components, enables adequate embedding enhancement and information exchange between the segmentation model and the visual-linguistic well-aligned CLIP encoder, resulting in superior segmentation performance under both open- and closed-vocabulary settings with much fewer need of additional data. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted across multiple datasets (e.g., COCO, ADE20K, Cityscapes, and PascalContext) under various circumstances, where the proposed OPSNet achieves state-of-the-art results, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach. The code and trained models will be made publicly available.</p></details> | ICCV2023 | None |
| **[3D detection of roof sections from a single satellite image and application to LOD2-building reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05409v1)** | 2023-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing urban areas in 3D out of satellite raster images has been a long-standing and challenging goal of both academical and industrial research. The rare methods today achieving this objective at a Level Of Details $2$ rely on procedural approaches based on geometry, and need stereo images and/or LIDAR data as input. We here propose a method for urban 3D reconstruction named KIBS(\textit{Keypoints Inference By Segmentation}), which comprises two novel features: i) a full deep learning approach for the 3D detection of the roof sections, and ii) only one single (non-orthogonal) satellite raster image as model input. This is achieved in two steps: i) by a Mask R-CNN model performing a 2D segmentation of the buildings' roof sections, and after blending these latter segmented pixels within the RGB satellite raster image, ii) by another identical Mask R-CNN model inferring the heights-to-ground of the roof sections' corners via panoptic segmentation, unto full 3D reconstruction of the buildings and city. We demonstrate the potential of the KIBS method by reconstructing different urban areas in a few minutes, with a Jaccard index for the 2D segmentation of individual roof sections of $88.55\%$ and $75.21\%$ on our two data sets resp., and a height's mean error of such correctly segmented pixels for the 3D reconstruction of $1.60$ m and $2.06$ m on our two data sets resp., hence within the LOD2 precision range.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[kMaX-DeepLab: k-means Mask Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04044v5)** | 2023-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of transformers in vision tasks not only advances network backbone designs, but also starts a brand-new page to achieve end-to-end image recognition (e.g., object detection and panoptic segmentation). Originated from Natural Language Processing (NLP), transformer architectures, consisting of self-attention and cross-attention, effectively learn long-range interactions between elements in a sequence. However, we observe that most existing transformer-based vision models simply borrow the idea from NLP, neglecting the crucial difference between languages and images, particularly the extremely large sequence length of spatially flattened pixel features. This subsequently impedes the learning in cross-attention between pixel features and object queries. In this paper, we rethink the relationship between pixels and object queries and propose to reformulate the cross-attention learning as a clustering process. Inspired by the traditional k-means clustering algorithm, we develop a k-means Mask Xformer (kMaX-DeepLab) for segmentation tasks, which not only improves the state-of-the-art, but also enjoys a simple and elegant design. As a result, our kMaX-DeepLab achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on COCO val set with 58.0% PQ, Cityscapes val set with 68.4% PQ, 44.0% AP, and 83.5% mIoU, and ADE20K val set with 50.9% PQ and 55.2% mIoU without test-time augmentation or external dataset.

It has many obvious applications for outdoor scene understanding, from city mapping to forest management. Existing methods struggle to segment nearby instances of the same semantic category, like adjacent pieces of street furniture or neighbouring trees, which limits their usability for inventory- or management-type applications that rely on object instances. This study explores the steps of the panoptic segmentation pipeline concerned with clustering points into object instances, with the goal to alleviate that bottleneck. We find that a carefully designed clustering strategy, which leverages multiple types of learned point embeddings, significantly improves instance segmentation. Experiments on the NPM3D urban mobile mapping dataset and the FOR-instance forest dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed strategy.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper offers a solution to this problem for indoor environments called InstaLoc, which operates on an individual lidar scan to localize it within a prior map. We draw on inspiration from how humans navigate and position themselves by recognizing the layout of distinctive objects and structures. Mimicking the human approach, InstaLoc identifies and matches object instances in the scene with those from a prior map. As far as we know, this is the first method to use panoptic segmentation directly inferring on 3D lidar scans for indoor localization. InstaLoc operates through two networks based on spatially sparse tensors to directly infer dense 3D lidar point clouds. The first network is a panoptic segmentation network that produces object instances and their semantic classes. The second smaller network produces a descriptor for each object instance. A consensus based matching algorithm then matches the instances to the prior map and estimates a six degrees of freedom (DoF) pose for the input cloud in the prior map. The significance of InstaLoc is that it has two efficient networks. It requires only one to two hours of training on a mobile GPU and runs in real-time at 1 Hz. Our method achieves between two and four times more detections when localizing, as compared to baseline methods, and achieves higher precision on these detections.</p></details> |  | None |

We observe that due to its high complexity, the training objective of panoptic segmentation will inevitably lead to much higher false positive penalization. Such unbalanced loss makes the training process of the end-to-end mask-transformer based architectures difficult, especially for efficient models. In this paper, we present ReMaX that adds relaxation to mask predictions and class predictions during training for panoptic segmentation. We demonstrate that via these simple relaxation techniques during training, our model can be consistently improved by a clear margin \textbf{without} any extra computational cost on inference.

This work proposes a new LPS framework named PANet to eliminate the dependency on the offset branch and improve the performance on large objects, which are always over-segmented by clustering algorithms. Firstly, we propose a non-learning Sparse Instance Proposal (SIP) module with the ``sampling-shifting-grouping" scheme to directly group thing points into instances from the raw point cloud efficiently. More specifically, balanced point sampling is introduced to generate sparse seed points with more uniform point distribution over the distance range. And a shift module, termed bubble shifting, is proposed to shrink the seed points to the clustered centers. Then we utilize the connected component label algorithm to generate instance proposals. Furthermore, an instance aggregation module is devised to integrate potentially fragmented instances, improving the performance of the SIP module on large objects. Extensive experiments show that PANet achieves state-of-the-art performance among published works on the SemanticKITII validation and nuScenes validation for the panoptic segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, IROS2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Improving Panoptic Segmentation for Nighttime or Low-Illumination Urban Driving Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13725v1)** | 2023-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles and driving systems use scene parsing as an essential tool to understand the surrounding environment. Panoptic segmentation is a state-of-the-art technique which proves to be pivotal in this use case. Deep learning-based architectures have been utilized for effective and efficient Panoptic Segmentation in recent times. However, when it comes to adverse conditions like dark scenes with poor illumination or nighttime images, existing methods perform poorly in comparison to daytime images. One of the main factors for poor results is the lack of sufficient and accurately annotated nighttime images for urban driving scenes. In this work, we propose two new methods, first to improve the performance, and second to improve the robustness of panoptic segmentation in nighttime or poor illumination urban driving scenes using a domain translation approach. The proposed approach makes use of CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017) to translate daytime images with existing panoptic annotations into nighttime images, which are then utilized to retrain a Panoptic segmentation model to improve performance and robustness under poor illumination and nighttime conditions. In our experiments, Approach-1 demonstrates a significant improvement in the Panoptic segmentation performance on the converted Cityscapes dataset with more than +10% PQ, +12% RQ, +2% SQ, +14% mIoU and +10% AP50 absolute gain. Approach-2 demonstrates improved robustness to varied nighttime driving environments. Both the approaches are supported via comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |
