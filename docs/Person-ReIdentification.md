| **[Vision Transformer for Robust Occluded Person Reidentification in Complex Surveillance Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27677v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion, viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT (Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded person ReID. Built on ViT-Base, Sh-ViT introduces three components: First, a Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to break spatial correlations and enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation (geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate surveillance conditions; Third, DeiT-based knowledge distillation to improve learning with limited labels.To support real-world evaluation, we construct the MyTT dataset, containing over 10,000 pedestrians and 30,000+ images from base station inspections, with frequent equipment occlusion and camera variations. Experiments show that Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on Market1501, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.In summary, Sh-ViT improves robustness to occlusion and blur without external modules, offering a practical solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring.</p></details> | 12 pages,conference | None |
| **[Benchmarking Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Algorithms on Transformer-based Embedding Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21989v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in embedding models for text, image, audio, and video drive progress across multiple domains, including retrieval-augmented generation, recommendation systems, vehicle/person reidentification, and face recognition. Many applications in these domains require an efficient method to retrieve items that are close to a given query in the embedding space while satisfying a filter condition based on the item's attributes, a problem known as Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS). In this work, we present a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of FANNS methods and analyze how they are benchmarked in the literature. By doing so, we identify a key challenge in the current FANNS landscape: the lack of diverse and realistic datasets, particularly ones derived from the latest transformer-based text embedding models. To address this, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of embedding vectors for the abstracts of over 2.7 million research articles from the arXiv repository, accompanied by 11 real-world attributes such as authors and categories. We benchmark a wide range of FANNS methods on our novel dataset and find that each method has distinct strengths and limitations; no single approach performs best across all scenarios. ACORN, for example, supports various filter types and performs reliably across dataset scales but is often outperformed by more specialized methods. SeRF shows excellent performance for range filtering on ordered attributes but cannot handle categorical attributes. Filtered-DiskANN and UNG excel on the medium-scale dataset but fail on the large-scale dataset, highlighting the challenge posed by transformer-based embeddings, which are often more than an order of magnitude larger than earlier embeddings. We conclude that no universally best method exists.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DetReIDX: A Stress-Test Dataset for Real-World UAV-Based Person Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04793v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (ReID) technology has been considered to perform relatively well under controlled, ground-level conditions, but it breaks down when deployed in challenging real-world settings. Evidently, this is due to extreme data variability factors such as resolution, viewpoint changes, scale variations, occlusions, and appearance shifts from clothing or session drifts. Moreover, the publicly available data sets do not realistically incorporate such kinds and magnitudes of variability, which limits the progress of this technology. This paper introduces DetReIDX, a large-scale aerial-ground person dataset, that was explicitly designed as a stress test to ReID under real-world conditions. DetReIDX is a multi-session set that includes over 13 million bounding boxes from 509 identities, collected in seven university campuses from three continents, with drone altitudes between 5.8 and 120 meters. More important, as a key novelty, DetReIDX subjects were recorded in (at least) two sessions on different days, with changes in clothing, daylight and location, making it suitable to actually evaluate long-term person ReID. Plus, data were annotated from 16 soft biometric attributes and multitask labels for detection, tracking, ReID, and action recognition. In order to provide empirical evidence of DetReIDX usefulness, we considered the specific tasks of human detection and ReID, where SOTA methods catastrophically degrade performance (up to 80% in detection accuracy and over 70% in Rank-1 ReID) when exposed to DetReIDXs conditions. The dataset, annotations, and official evaluation protocols are publicly available at https://www.it.ubi.pt/DetReIDX/</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving analytical color and texture similarity estimation methods for dataset-agnostic person reidentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05076v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies a combined person reidentification (re-id) method that uses human parsing, analytical feature extraction and similarity estimation schemes. One of its prominent features is its low computational requirements so it can be implemented on edge devices. The method allows direct comparison of specific image regions using interpretable features which consist of color and texture channels. It is proposed to analyze and compare colors in CIE-Lab color space using histogram smoothing for noise reduction. A novel pre-configured latent space (LS) supervised autoencoder (SAE) is proposed for texture analysis which encodes input textures as LS points. This allows to obtain more accurate similarity measures compared to simplistic label comparison. The proposed method also does not rely upon photos or other re-id data for training, which makes it completely re-id dataset-agnostic. The viability of the proposed method is verified by computing rank-1, rank-10, and mAP re-id metrics on Market1501 dataset. The results are comparable to those of conventional deep learning methods and the potential ways to further improve the method are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, 3 equations</p></details> | None |
| **[ENTIRe-ID: An Extensive and Diverse Dataset for Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20465v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing importance of person reidentification in computer vision has highlighted the need for more extensive and diverse datasets. In response, we introduce the ENTIRe-ID dataset, an extensive collection comprising over 4.45 million images from 37 different cameras in varied environments. This dataset is uniquely designed to tackle the challenges of domain variability and model generalization, areas where existing datasets for person re-identification have fallen short. The ENTIRe-ID dataset stands out for its coverage of a wide array of real-world scenarios, encompassing various lighting conditions, angles of view, and diverse human activities. This design ensures a realistic and robust training platform for ReID models.

| **[GaitMotion: A Multitask Dataset for Pathological Gait Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09569v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gait benchmark empowers uncounted encouraging research fields such as gait recognition, humanoid locomotion, etc. Despite the growing focus on gait analysis, the research community is hindered by the limitations of the currently available databases, which mostly consist of videos or images with limited labeling. In this paper, we introduce GaitMotion, a multitask dataset leveraging wearable sensors to capture the patients' real-time movement with pathological gait. This dataset offers extensive ground-truth labeling for multiple tasks, including step/stride segmentation and step/stride length prediction, empowers researchers with a more holistic understanding of gait disturbances linked to neurological impairments. The wearable gait analysis suit captures the gait cycle, pattern, and parameters for both normal and pathological subjects. This data may prove beneficial for healthcare products focused on patient progress monitoring and post-disease recovery, as well as for forensics technologies aimed at person reidentification, and biomechanics research to aid in the development of humanoid robotics. Moreover, the analysis has considered the drift in data distribution across individual subjects. This drift can be attributed to each participant's unique behavioral habits or potential displacement of the sensor. Stride length variance for normal, Parkinson's, and stroke patients are compared to recognize the pathological walking pattern. As the baseline and benchmark, we provide an error of 14.1, 13.3, and 12.2 centimeters of stride length prediction for normal, Parkinson's, and Stroke gaits separately. We also analyzed the gait characteristics for normal and pathological gaits in terms of the gait cycle and gait parameters.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust Ensemble Person Re-Identification via Orthogonal Fusion with Occlusion Handling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00107v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occlusion remains one of the major challenges in person reidentification (ReID) as a result of the diversity of poses and the variation of appearances. Developing novel architectures to improve the robustness of occlusion-aware person Re-ID requires new insights, especially on low-resolution edge cameras. We propose a deep ensemble model that harnesses both CNN and Transformer architectures to generate robust feature representations. To achieve robust Re-ID without the need to manually label occluded regions, we propose to take an ensemble learning-based approach derived from the analogy between arbitrarily shaped occluded regions and robust feature representation. Using the orthogonality principle, our developed deep CNN model makes use of masked autoencoder (MAE) and global-local feature fusion for robust person identification. Furthermore, we present a part occlusion-aware transformer capable of learning feature space that is robust to occluded regions. Experimental results are reported on several Re-ID datasets to show the effectiveness of our developed ensemble model named orthogonal fusion with occlusion handling (OFOH). Compared to competing methods, the proposed OFOH approach has achieved competent rank-1 and mAP performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Person Re-Identification through Tensor Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10470v1)** | 2023-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel person reidentification (PRe-ID) system that based on tensor feature representation and multilinear subspace learning. Our approach utilizes pretrained CNNs for high-level feature extraction, along with Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO) and Gaussian Of Gaussian (GOG ) descriptors. Additionally, Cross-View Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (TXQDA) algorithm is used for multilinear subspace learning, which models the data in a tensor framework to enhance discriminative capabilities. Similarity measure based on Mahalanobis distance is used for matching between training and test pedestrian images. Experimental evaluations on VIPeR and PRID450s datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TextAug: Test time Text Augmentation for Multimodal Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01605v1)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Person Reidentification is gaining popularity in the research community due to its effectiveness compared to counter-part unimodal frameworks. However, the bottleneck for multimodal deep learning is the need for a large volume of multimodal training examples. Data augmentation techniques such as cropping, flipping, rotation, etc. are often employed in the image domain to improve the generalization of deep learning models. Augmenting in other modalities than images, such as text, is challenging and requires significant computational resources and external data sources. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of two computer vision data augmentation techniques: cutout and cutmix, for text augmentation in multi-modal person re-identification. Our approach merges these two augmentation strategies into one strategy called CutMixOut which involves randomly removing words or sub-phrases from a sentence (Cutout) and blending parts of two or more sentences to create diverse examples (CutMix) with a certain probability assigned to each operation. This augmentation was implemented at inference time without any prior training. Our results demonstrate that the proposed technique is simple and effective in improving the performance on multiple multimodal person re-identification benchmarks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[A Semantic-aware Attention and Visual Shielding Network for Cloth-changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08387v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the human appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very difficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature representations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches, but the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian features before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module (HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly, these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted for cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this method can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and PRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2108.04527</p></details> | None |
| **[Identity-Guided Collaborative Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Reidentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04400v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that is aimed at addressing the issues of large feature variations due to cloth-changing and pedestrian view/pose changes. Although significant progress has been achieved by introducing extra information (e.g., human contour sketching information, human body keypoints, and 3D human information), cloth-changing person ReID is still challenging due to impressionable pedestrian representations. Moreover, human semantic information and pedestrian identity information are not fully explored. To solve these issues, we propose a novel identity-guided collaborative learning scheme (IGCL) for cloth-changing person ReID, where the human semantic is fully utilized and the identity is unchangeable to guide collaborative learning. First, we design a novel clothing attention degradation stream to reasonably reduce the interference caused by clothing information where clothing attention and mid-level collaborative learning are employed. Second, we propose a human semantic attention and body jigsaw stream to highlight the human semantic information and simulate different poses of the same identity. In this way, the extraction features not only focus on human semantic information that is unrelated to the background but also are suitable for pedestrian pose variations. Moreover, a pedestrian identity enhancement stream is further proposed to enhance the identity importance and extract more favorable identity robust features. Most importantly, all these streams are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework, and the identity is utilized to guide the optimization. Extensive experiments on five public clothing person ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed IGCL significantly outperforms SOTA methods and that the extracted feature is more robust, discriminative, and clothing-irrelevant.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Meta Generative Attack on Person Reidentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06286v1)** | 2023-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks have been recently investigated in person re-identification. These attacks perform well under cross dataset or cross model setting. However, the challenges present in cross-dataset cross-model scenario does not allow these models to achieve similar accuracy. To this end, we propose our method with the goal of achieving better transferability against different models and across datasets. We generate a mask to obtain better performance across models and use meta learning to boost the generalizability in the challenging cross-dataset cross-model setting. Experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT-17 demonstrate favorable results compared to other attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Google Coral-based edge computing person reidentification using human parsing combined with analytical method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11024v1)** | 2022-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (re-ID) is becoming one of the most significant application areas of computer vision due to its importance for science and social security. Due to enormous size and scale of camera systems it is beneficial to develop edge computing re-ID applications where at least part of the analysis could be performed by the cameras. However, conventional re-ID relies heavily on deep learning (DL) computationally demanding models which are not readily applicable for edge computing. In this paper we adapt a recently proposed re-ID method that combines DL human parsing with analytical feature extraction and ranking schemes to be more suitable for edge computing re-ID. First, we compare parsers that use ResNet101, ResNet18, MobileNetV2, and OSNet backbones and show that parsing can be performed using compact backbones with sufficient accuracy. Second, we transfer parsers to tensor processing unit (TPU) of Google Coral Dev Board and show that it can act as a portable edge computing re-ID station. We also implement the analytical part of re-ID method on Coral CPU to ensure that it can perform a complete re-ID cycle. For quantitative analysis we compare inference speed, parsing masks, and re-ID accuracy on GPU and Coral TPU depending on parser backbone. We also discuss possible application scenarios of edge computing in re-ID taking into account known limitations mainly related to memory and storage space of portable devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Combining human parsing with analytical feature extraction and ranking schemes for high-generalization person reidentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14243v1)** | 2022-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (re-ID) has been receiving increasing attention in recent years due to its importance for both science and society. Machine learning and particularly Deep Learning (DL) has become the main re-id tool that allowed researches to achieve unprecedented accuracy levels on benchmark datasets. However, there is a known problem of poor generalization of DL models. That is, models trained to achieve high accuracy on one dataset perform poorly on other ones and require re-training. To address this issue, we present a model without trainable parameters which shows great potential for high generalization. It combines a fully analytical feature extraction and similarity ranking scheme with DL-based human parsing used to obtain the initial subregion classification. We show that such combination to a high extent eliminates the drawbacks of existing analytical methods. We use interpretable color and texture features which have human-readable similarity measures associated with them. To verify the proposed method we conduct experiments on Market1501 and CUHK03 datasets achieving competitive rank-1 accuracy comparable with that of DL-models. Most importantly we show that our method achieves 63.9% and 93.5% rank-1 cross-domain accuracy when applied to transfer learning tasks. It is significantly higher than previously reported 30-50% transfer accuracy. We discuss the potential ways of adding new features to further improve the model. We also show the advantage of interpretable features for constructing human-generated queries from verbal description to conduct search without a query image.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables, 15 equations</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Fewer Labels: Support Pair Active Learning for Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10008v1)** | 2022-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised-learning based person re-identification (re-id) require a large amount of manual labeled data, which is not applicable in practical re-id deployment. In this work, we propose a Support Pair Active Learning (SPAL) framework to lower the manual labeling cost for large-scale person reidentification. The support pairs can provide the most informative relationships and support the discriminative feature learning. Specifically, we firstly design a dual uncertainty selection strategy to iteratively discover support pairs and require human annotations. Afterwards, we introduce a constrained clustering algorithm to propagate the relationships of labeled support pairs to other unlabeled samples. Moreover, a hybrid learning strategy consisting of an unsupervised contrastive loss and a supervised support pair loss is proposed to learn the discriminative re-id feature representation. The proposed overall framework can effectively lower the labeling cost by mining and leveraging the critical support pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art active learning methods on large-scale person re-id benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MMD-ReID: A Simple but Effective Solution for Visible-Thermal Person ReID](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05059v1)** | 2021-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning modality invariant features is central to the problem of Visible-Thermal cross-modal Person Reidentification (VT-ReID), where query and gallery images come from different modalities. Existing works implicitly align the modalities in pixel and feature spaces by either using adversarial learning or carefully designing feature extraction modules that heavily rely on domain knowledge. We propose a simple but effective framework, MMD-ReID, that reduces the modality gap by an explicit discrepancy reduction constraint. MMD-ReID takes inspiration from Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a widely used statistical tool for hypothesis testing that determines the distance between two distributions. MMD-ReID uses a novel margin-based formulation to match class-conditional feature distributions of visible and thermal samples to minimize intra-class distances while maintaining feature discriminability. MMD-ReID is a simple framework in terms of architecture and loss formulation. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively the effectiveness of MMD-ReID in aligning the marginal and class conditional distributions, thus learning both modality-independent and identity-consistent features. The proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets.

| **[DSSL: Deep Surroundings-person Separation Learning for Text-based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05534v1)** | 2021-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many previous methods on text-based person retrieval tasks are devoted to learning a latent common space mapping, with the purpose of extracting modality-invariant features from both visual and textual modality. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of high-dimensional data, the unconstrained mapping paradigms are not able to properly catch discriminative clues about the corresponding person while drop the misaligned information. Intuitively, the information contained in visual data can be divided into person information (PI) and surroundings information (SI), which are mutually exclusive from each other. To this end, we propose a novel Deep Surroundings-person Separation Learning (DSSL) model in this paper to effectively extract and match person information, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. A surroundings-person separation and fusion mechanism plays the key role to realize an accurate and effective surroundings-person separation under a mutually exclusion constraint. In order to adequately utilize multi-modal and multi-granular information for a higher retrieval accuracy, five diverse alignment paradigms are adopted. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed DSSL on CUHK-PEDES, which is currently the only accessible dataset for text-base person retrieval task. DSSL achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-PEDES. To properly evaluate our proposed DSSL in the real scenarios, a Real Scenarios Text-based Person Reidentification (RSTPReid) dataset is constructed to benefit future research on text-based person retrieval, which will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM'21</p></details> | None |
| **[Multigranular Visual-Semantic Embedding for Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04527v1)** | 2021-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine learning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been proposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the same clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance must be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person has a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they also often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing person ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail. To date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task, but since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for representing people with different clothes, their performances need to be improved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding algorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual semantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and the generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively solve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a person with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme (MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth desensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of the approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level human attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of pose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially semantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic information that is used to align the human attributes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Framework to Enhance Generalization of Deep Metric Learning methods using General Discriminative Feature Learning and Class Adversarial Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06420v1)** | 2021-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metric learning algorithms aim to learn a distance function that brings the semantically similar data items together and keeps dissimilar ones at a distance. The traditional Mahalanobis distance learning is equivalent to find a linear projection. In contrast, Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods are proposed that automatically extract features from data and learn a non-linear transformation from input space to a semantically embedding space. Recently, many DML methods are proposed focused to enhance the discrimination power of the learned metric by providing novel sampling strategies or loss functions. This approach is very helpful when both the training and test examples are coming from the same set of categories. However, it is less effective in many applications of DML such as image retrieval and person-reidentification. Here, the DML should learn general semantic concepts from observed classes and employ them to rank or identify objects from unseen categories. Neglecting the generalization ability of the learned representation and just emphasizing to learn a more discriminative embedding on the observed classes may lead to the overfitting problem. To address this limitation, we propose a framework to enhance the generalization power of existing DML methods in a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) setting by general yet discriminative representation learning and employing a class adversarial neural network. To learn a more general representation, we propose to employ feature maps of intermediate layers in a deep neural network and enhance their discrimination power through an attention mechanism. Besides, a class adversarial network is utilized to enforce the deep model to seek class invariant features for the DML task. We evaluate our work on widely used machine vision datasets in a ZSL setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inclu...</summary><p>Includes: 31 Pages, 5 Tables, 15 Figures</p></details> | None |

On the other hand, in the area of speech recognition the metric embeddings generated by the triplet loss are rarely used even for classification problems. We fill this gap showing that a combination of two representation learning techniques: a triplet loss-based embedding and a variant of kNN for classification instead of cross-entropy loss significantly (by 26% to 38%) improves the classification accuracy for convolutional networks on a LibriSpeech-derived LibriWords datasets. To do so, we propose a novel phonetic similarity based triplet mining approach. We also improve the current best published SOTA for Google Speech Commands dataset V1 10+2 -class classification by about 34%, achieving 98.55% accuracy, V2 10+2-class classification by about 20%, achieving 98.37% accuracy, and V2 35-class classification by over 50%, achieving 97.0% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SPECOM 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[APES: Audiovisual Person Search in Untrimmed Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01667v1)** | 2021-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans are arguably one of the most important subjects in video streams, many real-world applications such as video summarization or video editing workflows often require the automatic search and retrieval of a person of interest. Despite tremendous efforts in the person reidentification and retrieval domains, few works have developed audiovisual search strategies. In this paper, we present the Audiovisual Person Search dataset (APES), a new dataset composed of untrimmed videos whose audio (voices) and visual (faces) streams are densely annotated. APES contains over 1.9K identities labeled along 36 hours of video, making it the largest dataset available for untrimmed audiovisual person search. A key property of APES is that it includes dense temporal annotations that link faces to speech segments of the same identity. To showcase the potential of our new dataset, we propose an audiovisual baseline and benchmark for person retrieval. Our study shows that modeling audiovisual cues benefits the recognition of people's identities. To enable reproducibility and promote future research, the dataset annotations and baseline code are available at: https://github.com/fuankarion/audiovisual-person-search</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/fuankarion/audiovisual-person-search) |
| **[How important are faces for person re-identification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06307v1)** | 2020-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the dependence of existing state-of-the-art person re-identification models on the presence and visibility of human faces. We apply a face detection and blurring algorithm to create anonymized versions of several popular person re-identification datasets including Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03, Viper, and Airport. Using a cross-section of existing state-of-the-art models that range in accuracy and computational efficiency, we evaluate the effect of this anonymization on re-identification performance using standard metrics. Perhaps surprisingly, the effect on mAP is very small, and accuracy is recovered by simply training on the anonymized versions of the data rather than the original data. These findings are consistent across multiple models and datasets. These results indicate that datasets can be safely anonymized by blurring faces without significantly impacting the performance of person reidentification systems, and may allow for the release of new richer re-identification datasets where previously there were privacy or data protection concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>25th ...</summary><p>25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2020), Milan, Italy, 10-15 January 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[Density-Adaptive Kernel based Efficient Reranking Approaches for Person Reidentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07698v3)** | 2020-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (ReID) refers to the task of verifying the identity of a pedestrian observed from nonoverlapping views in a surveillance camera network. It has recently been validated that reranking can achieve remarkable performance improvements in person ReID systems. However, current reranking approaches either require feedback from users or suffer from burdensome computational costs. In this paper, we propose to exploit a density-adaptive smooth kernel technique to achieve efficient and effective reranking. Specifically, we adopt a smooth kernel function to formulate the neighbor relationships among data samples with a density-adaptive parameter. Based on this new formulation, we present two simple yet effective reranking methods, termed \emph{inverse} density-adaptive kernel based reranking (inv-DAKR) and \emph{bidirectional} density-adaptive kernel based reranking (bi-DAKR), in which the local density information in the vicinity of each gallery sample is elegantly exploited. Moreover, we extend the proposed inv-DAKR and bi-DAKR methods to incorporate the available extra probe samples and demonstrate that when and why these extra probe samples are able to improve the local neighborhood and thus further refine the ranking results. Extensive experiments are conducted on six benchmark datasets, including: PRID450s, VIPeR, CUHK03, GRID, Market-1501 and Mars. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposals are effective and efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 18 figures and 12 tables.

| **[Mixed High-Order Attention Network for Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05819v1)** | 2019-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention has become more attractive in person reidentification (ReID) as it is capable of biasing the allocation of available resources towards the most informative parts of an input signal. However, state-of-the-art works concentrate only on coarse or first-order attention design, e.g. spatial and channels attention, while rarely exploring higher-order attention mechanism. We take a step towards addressing this problem. In this paper, we first propose the High-Order Attention (HOA) module to model and utilize the complex and high-order statistics information in attention mechanism, so as to capture the subtle differences among pedestrians and to produce the discriminative attention proposals. Then, rethinking person ReID as a zero-shot learning problem, we propose the Mixed High-Order Attention Network (MHN) to further enhance the discrimination and richness of attention knowledge in an explicit manner. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of our MHN for person ReID over a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale datasets, including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID and CUHK03-NP.

| **[Weakly Supervised Open-set Domain Adaptation by Dual-domain Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13179v1)** | 2019-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In conventional domain adaptation, a critical assumption is that there exists a fully labeled domain (source) that contains the same label space as another unlabeled or scarcely labeled domain (target). However, in the real world, there often exist application scenarios in which both domains are partially labeled and not all classes are shared between these two domains. Thus, it is meaningful to let partially labeled domains learn from each other to classify all the unlabeled samples in each domain under an open-set setting. We consider this problem as weakly supervised open-set domain adaptation. To address this practical setting, we propose the Collaborative Distribution Alignment (CDA) method, which performs knowledge transfer bilaterally and works collaboratively to classify unlabeled data and identify outlier samples. Extensive experiments on the Office benchmark and an application on person reidentification show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | CVPR 2019 | None |
| **[Image-to-Video Person Re-Identification by Reusing Cross-modal Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03989v2)** | 2018-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-video person re-identification identifies a target person by a probe image from quantities of pedestrian videos captured by non-overlapping cameras. Despite the great progress achieved,it's still challenging to match in the multimodal scenario,i.e. between image and video. Currently,state-of-the-art approaches mainly focus on the task-specific data,neglecting the extra information on the different but related tasks. In this paper,we propose an end-to-end neural network framework for image-to-video person reidentification by leveraging cross-modal embeddings learned from extra information.Concretely speaking,cross-modal embeddings from image captioning and video captioning models are reused to help learned features be projected into a coordinated space,where similarity can be directly computed. Besides,training steps from fixed model reuse approach are integrated into our framework,which can incorporate beneficial information and eventually make the target networks independent of existing models. Apart from that,our proposed framework resorts to CNNs and LSTMs for extracting visual and spatiotemporal features,and combines the strengths of identification and verification model to improve the discriminative ability of the learned feature. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on narrowing down the gap between heterogeneous data and obtaining observable improvement in image-to-video person re-identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review for Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> | None |
