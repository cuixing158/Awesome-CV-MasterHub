| **[BOP Challenge 2024 on Model-Based and Model-Free 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02812v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the evaluation methodology, datasets and results of the BOP Challenge 2024, the sixth in a series of public competitions organized to capture the state of the art in 6D object pose estimation and related tasks. In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks, each defined by a task, object onboarding setup, and dataset group. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 25X faster and 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have a similar ranking on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still noticealy (-53%) behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023). The online evaluation system stays open and is available at http://bop.felk.cvut.cz/</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.09799</p></details> | None |
| **[PicoPose: Progressive Pixel-to-Pixel Correspondence Learning for Novel Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02617v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel object pose estimation from RGB images presents a significant challenge for zero-shot generalization, as it involves estimating the relative 6D transformation between an RGB observation and a CAD model of an object that was not seen during training. In this paper, we introduce PicoPose, a novel framework designed to tackle this task using a three-stage pixel-to-pixel correspondence learning process. Firstly, PicoPose matches features from the RGB observation with those from rendered object templates, identifying the best-matched template and establishing coarse correspondences. Secondly, PicoPose smooths the correspondences by globally regressing a 2D affine transformation, including in-plane rotation, scale, and 2D translation, from the coarse correspondence map. Thirdly, PicoPose applies the affine transformation to the feature map of the best-matched template and learns correspondence offsets within local regions to achieve fine-grained correspondences. By progressively refining the correspondences, PicoPose significantly improves the accuracy of object poses computed via PnP/RANSAC. PicoPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on the seven core datasets of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating exceptional generalization to novel objects represented by CAD models or object reference images.

| **[RePoseD: Efficient Relative Pose Estimation With Known Depth Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07742v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in monocular depth estimation methods (MDE) and their improved accuracy open new possibilities for their applications. In this paper, we investigate how monocular depth estimates can be used for relative pose estimation. In particular, we are interested in answering the question whether using MDEs improves results over traditional point-based methods. We propose a novel framework for estimating the relative pose of two cameras from point correspondences with associated monocular depths. Since depth predictions are typically defined up to an unknown scale or even both unknown scale and shift parameters, our solvers jointly estimate the scale or both the scale and shift parameters along with the relative pose. We derive efficient solvers considering different types of depths for three camera configurations: (1) two calibrated cameras, (2) two cameras with an unknown shared focal length, and (3) two cameras with unknown different focal lengths. Our new solvers outperform state-of-the-art depth-aware solvers in terms of speed and accuracy. In extensive real experiments on multiple datasets and with various MDEs, we discuss which depth-aware solvers are preferable in which situation. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 18 pages | None |

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual-stream Transformer-GCN Model with Contextualized Representations Learning for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01764v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach to monocular 3D human pose estimation using contextualized representation learning with the Transformer-GCN dual-stream model. Monocular 3D human pose estimation is challenged by depth ambiguity, limited 3D-labeled training data, imbalanced modeling, and restricted model generalization. To address these limitations, our work introduces a groundbreaking motion pre-training method based on contextualized representation learning. Specifically, our method involves masking 2D pose features and utilizing a Transformer-GCN dual-stream model to learn high-dimensional representations through a self-distillation setup. By focusing on contextualized representation learning and spatial-temporal modeling, our approach enhances the model's ability to understand spatial-temporal relationships between postures, resulting in superior generalization. Furthermore, leveraging the Transformer-GCN dual-stream model, our approach effectively balances global and local interactions in video pose estimation. The model adaptively integrates information from both the Transformer and GCN streams, where the GCN stream effectively learns local relationships between adjacent key points and frames, while the Transformer stream captures comprehensive global spatial and temporal features. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, with an MPJPE of 38.0mm and P-MPJPE of 31.9mm on Human3.6M, and an MPJPE of 15.9mm on MPI-INF-3DHP. Furthermore, visual experiments on public datasets and in-the-wild videos demonstrate the robustness and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Universal Global State Estimation for Inertial Navigation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03846v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of accurate pose estimation (position, velocity, and orientation) for a rigid body. By utilizing generic exteroceptive measurements in combination with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), we reformulate the vehicle's dynamics and outputs to fit within a linear time-varying (LTV) framework. This transformation enables the application of a linear continuous-time Kalman filter, thereby avoiding the complexities of nonlinear estimators and local Kalman-type filtering methods (e.g., EKF). We perform a complete uniform observability analysis for key benchmark problems (e.g., GPS-INS and Landmark-INS) and derive sufficient conditions for ensuring global uniform exponential stability. Simulations are conducted for two practical applications: stereo-aided inertial navigation systems (INS) with both constant and time-varying gains, as well as GPS-aided INS. The proposed approach notably simplifies observer design for INS.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |
| **[ForestVO: Enhancing Visual Odometry in Forest Environments through ForestGlue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01261v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in visual odometry systems have improved autonomous navigation; however, challenges persist in complex environments like forests, where dense foliage, variable lighting, and repetitive textures compromise feature correspondence accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce ForestGlue, enhancing the SuperPoint feature detector through four configurations - grayscale, RGB, RGB-D, and stereo-vision - optimised for various sensing modalities. For feature matching, we employ LightGlue or SuperGlue, retrained with synthetic forest data. ForestGlue achieves comparable pose estimation accuracy to baseline models but requires only 512 keypoints - just 25% of the baseline's 2048 - to reach an LO-RANSAC AUC score of 0.745 at a 10{\deg} threshold. With only a quarter of keypoints needed, ForestGlue significantly reduces computational overhead, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic forest environments, and making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. By combining ForestGlue with a transformer-based pose estimation model, we propose ForestVO, which estimates relative camera poses using matched 2D pixel coordinates between frames. On challenging TartanAir forest sequences, ForestVO achieves an average relative pose error (RPE) of 1.09 m and a kitti_score of 2.33%, outperforming direct-based methods like DSO by 40% in dynamic scenes. Despite using only 10% of the dataset for training, ForestVO maintains competitive performance with TartanVO while being a significantly lighter model. This work establishes an end-to-end deep learning pipeline specifically tailored for visual odometry in forested environments, leveraging forest-specific training data to optimise feature correspondence and pose estimation, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of autonomous navigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> | None |
| **[UniT: Data Efficient Tactile Representation with Generalization to Unseen Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06481v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UniT is an approach to tactile representation learning, using VQGAN to learn a compact latent space and serve as the tactile representation. It uses tactile images obtained from a single simple object to train the representation with generalizability. This tactile representation can be zero-shot transferred to various downstream tasks, including perception tasks and manipulation policy learning. Our benchmarkings on in-hand 3D pose and 6D pose estimation tasks and a tactile classification task show that UniT outperforms existing visual and tactile representation learning methods. Additionally, UniT's effectiveness in policy learning is demonstrated across three real-world tasks involving diverse manipulated objects and complex robot-object-environment interactions. Through extensive experimentation, UniT is shown to be a simple-to-train, plug-and-play, yet widely effective method for tactile representation learning.

| **[Image as an IMU: Estimating Camera Motion from a Single Motion-Blurred Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17358v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many robotics and VR/AR applications, fast camera motions cause a high level of motion blur, causing existing camera pose estimation methods to fail. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages motion blur as a rich cue for motion estimation rather than treating it as an unwanted artifact. Our approach works by predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map directly from a single motion-blurred image. We then recover the instantaneous camera velocity by solving a linear least squares problem under the small motion assumption. In essence, our method produces an IMU-like measurement that robustly captures fast and aggressive camera movements. To train our model, we construct a large-scale dataset with realistic synthetic motion blur derived from ScanNet++v2 and further refine our model by training end-to-end on real data using our fully differentiable pipeline. Extensive evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art angular and translational velocity estimates, outperforming current methods like MASt3R and COLMAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jerredchen.github.io/image-as-imu/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://jerredchen.github.io/image-as-imu) |
| **[AP-CAP: Advancing High-Quality Data Synthesis for Animal Pose Estimation via a Controllable Image Generation Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00394v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of 2D animal pose estimation plays a crucial role in advancing deep learning applications in animal behavior analysis and ecological research. Despite notable progress in some existing approaches, our study reveals that the scarcity of high-quality datasets remains a significant bottleneck, limiting the full potential of current methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Controllable Image Generation Pipeline for synthesizing animal pose estimation data, termed AP-CAP. Within this pipeline, we introduce a Multi-Modal Animal Image Generation Model capable of producing images with expected poses. To enhance the quality and diversity of the generated data, we further propose three innovative strategies: (1) Modality-Fusion-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to integrate multi-source appearance representations, (2) Pose-Adjustment-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to dynamically capture diverse pose variations, and (3) Caption-Enhancement-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to enrich visual semantic understanding. Leveraging the proposed model and strategies, we create the MPCH Dataset (Modality-Pose-Caption Hybrid), the first hybrid dataset that innovatively combines synthetic and real data, establishing the largest-scale multi-source heterogeneous benchmark repository for animal pose estimation to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in improving both the performance and generalization capability of animal pose estimators.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Easi3R: Estimating Disentangled Motion from DUSt3R Without Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24391v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point clouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network architectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets.

For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths. Integration of YOLO11 and Depth Anything Model provides a promising solution to 3D pose estimation of immature green fruits for robotic thinning applications.

We extract keypoints from the reference image and generate a 3D reference map with 3D reconstruction of the keypoints in advance. We emphasize that the more keypoints in the 3D reference map and the smaller the error of the 3D positions of the keypoints, the higher the accuracy of the camera pose estimation. However, previous image-only methods require a huge number of images, and it is difficult to 3D-reconstruct keypoints without error due to inevitable mismatches and failures in feature matching. As a result, the 3D reference map is sparse and inaccurate. In contrast, accurate 3D reference maps can be generated by combining images and 3D sensors. Recently, 3D-LiDAR has been widely used around the world. LiDAR, which measures a large space with high density, has become inexpensive. In addition, accurately calibrated cameras are also widely used, so images that record the external parameters of the camera without errors can be easily obtained. In this paper, we propose a method to directly assign 3D LiDAR point clouds to keypoints to generate dense and accurate 3D reference maps. The proposed method avoids feature matching and achieves accurate 3D reconstruction for almost all keypoints. To estimate camera pose over a wide area, we use the wide-area LiDAR point cloud to remove points that are not visible to the camera and reduce 2D-3D correspondence errors. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we apply the proposed method to several state-of-the-art local features and confirm that it improves the accuracy of camera pose estimation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

Despite recent advances, existing methods often produce physically inconsistent pose estimates, hindering their deployment in real-world scenarios. We introduce PhysPose, a novel approach that integrates physical reasoning into pose estimation through a postprocessing optimization enforcing non-penetration and gravitational constraints. By leveraging scene geometry, PhysPose refines pose estimates to ensure physical plausibility. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the YCB-Video dataset from the BOP benchmark and improves over the state-of-the-art pose estimation methods on the HOPE-Video dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate its impact in robotics by significantly improving success rates in a challenging pick-and-place task, highlighting the importance of physical consistency in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://data.ciirc.cvut.cz/public/projects/2025PhysPose</p></details> | None |
| **[Improving Indoor Localization Accuracy by Using an Efficient Implicit Neural Map Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23480v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally localizing a mobile robot in a known map is often a foundation for enabling robots to navigate and operate autonomously. In indoor environments, traditional Monte Carlo localization based on occupancy grid maps is considered the gold standard, but its accuracy is limited by the representation capabilities of the occupancy grid map. In this paper, we address the problem of building an effective map representation that allows to accurately perform probabilistic global localization. To this end, we propose an implicit neural map representation that is able to capture positional and directional geometric features from 2D LiDAR scans to efficiently represent the environment and learn a neural network that is able to predict both, the non-projective signed distance and a direction-aware projective distance for an arbitrary point in the mapped environment. This combination of neural map representation with a light-weight neural network allows us to design an efficient observation model within a conventional Monte Carlo localization framework for pose estimation of a robot in real time. We evaluated our approach to indoor localization on a publicly available dataset for global localization and the experimental results indicate that our approach is able to more accurately localize a mobile robot than other localization approaches employing occupancy or existing neural map representations. In contrast to other approaches employing an implicit neural map representation for 2D LiDAR localization, our approach allows to perform real-time pose tracking after convergence and near real-time global localization. The code of our approach is available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/enm-mcl.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[SparseLoc: Sparse Open-Set Landmark-based Global Localization for Autonomous Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23465v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global localization is a critical problem in autonomous navigation, enabling precise positioning without reliance on GPS. Modern global localization techniques often depend on dense LiDAR maps, which, while precise, require extensive storage and computational resources. Recent approaches have explored alternative methods, such as sparse maps and learned features, but they suffer from poor robustness and generalization. We propose SparseLoc, a global localization framework that leverages vision-language foundation models to generate sparse, semantic-topometric maps in a zero-shot manner. It combines this map representation with a Monte Carlo localization scheme enhanced by a novel late optimization strategy, ensuring improved pose estimation. By constructing compact yet highly discriminative maps and refining localization through a carefully designed optimization schedule, SparseLoc overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, offering a more efficient and robust solution for global localization. Our system achieves over a 5X improvement in localization accuracy compared to existing sparse mapping techniques. Despite utilizing only 1/500th of the points of dense mapping methods, it achieves comparable performance, maintaining an average global localization error below 5m and 2 degrees on KITTI sequences.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HiPART: Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer for Occluded 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23331v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 2D-to-3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods struggle with the occlusion issue by enriching information like temporal and visual cues in the lifting stage. In this paper, we argue that these methods ignore the limitation of the sparse skeleton 2D input representation, which fundamentally restricts the 2D-to-3D lifting and worsens the occlusion issue. To address these, we propose a novel two-stage generative densification method, named Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer (HiPART), to generate hierarchical 2D dense poses from the original sparse 2D pose. Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale skeleton tokenization module to quantize the highly dense 2D pose into hierarchical tokens and propose a Skeleton-aware Alignment to strengthen token connections. We then develop a Hierarchical AutoRegressive Modeling scheme for hierarchical 2D pose generation. With generated hierarchical poses as inputs for 2D-to-3D lifting, the proposed method shows strong robustness in occluded scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-frame-based 3D HPE. Moreover, it outperforms numerous multi-frame methods while reducing parameter and computational complexity and can also complement them to further enhance performance and robustness.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |

In order to solve these problems, we propose a novel LIDAR-based localization framework, which achieves high accuracy and provides robust localization in 3D pointcloud maps with information of multi-sensors. The system integrates global information with LIDAR-based odometry to optimize the localization state. To improve robustness and enable fast resumption of localization, this paper uses offline pointcloud maps for prior knowledge and presents a novel registration method to speed up the convergence rate. The algorithm is tested on various maps of different data sets and has higher robustness and accuracy than other localization algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |

However,most of the existing methods are computationally expensive or have complex architecture. Here we propose a lightweight attention based pose estimation network that utilizes depthwise separable convolution and Convolutional Block Attention Module on an hourglass backbone. The network significantly reduces the computational complexity (floating point operations) and the model size (number of parameters) containing only about 10% of parameters of original eight stack Hourglass network. Experiments were conducted on COCO and MPII datasets using a two stack hourglass backbone. The results showed that our model performs well in comparison to six other lightweight pose estimation models with an average precision of 72.07. The model achieves this performance with only 2.3M parameters and 3.7G FLOPs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ForcePose: A Deep Learning Approach for Force Calculation Based on Action Recognition Using MediaPipe Pose Estimation Combined with Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22363v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Force estimation in human-object interactions is crucial for various fields like ergonomics, physical therapy, and sports science. Traditional methods depend on specialized equipment such as force plates and sensors, which makes accurate assessments both expensive and restricted to laboratory settings. In this paper, we introduce ForcePose, a novel deep learning framework that estimates applied forces by combining human pose estimation with object detection. Our approach leverages MediaPipe for skeletal tracking and SSD MobileNet for object recognition to create a unified representation of human-object interaction. We've developed a specialized neural network that processes both spatial and temporal features to predict force magnitude and direction without needing any physical sensors. After training on our dataset of 850 annotated videos with corresponding force measurements, our model achieves a mean absolute error of 5.83 N in force magnitude and 7.4 degrees in force direction. When compared to existing computer vision approaches, our method performs 27.5% better while still offering real-time performance on standard computing hardware. ForcePose opens up new possibilities for force analysis in diverse real-world scenarios where traditional measurement tools are impractical or intrusive. This paper discusses our methodology, the dataset creation process, evaluation metrics, and potential applications across rehabilitation, ergonomics assessment, and athletic performance analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GCRayDiffusion: Pose-Free Surface Reconstruction via Geometric Consistent Ray Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22349v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate surface reconstruction from unposed images is crucial for efficient 3D object or scene creation. However, it remains challenging, particularly for the joint camera pose estimation. Previous approaches have achieved impressive pose-free surface reconstruction results in dense-view settings, but could easily fail for sparse-view scenarios without sufficient visual overlap. In this paper, we propose a new technique for pose-free surface reconstruction, which follows triplane-based signed distance field (SDF) learning but regularizes the learning by explicit points sampled from ray-based diffusion of camera pose estimation. Our key contribution is a novel Geometric Consistent Ray Diffusion model (GCRayDiffusion), where we represent camera poses as neural bundle rays and regress the distribution of noisy rays via a diffusion model. More importantly, we further condition the denoising process of RGRayDiffusion using the triplane-based SDF of the entire scene, which provides effective 3D consistent regularization to achieve multi-view consistent camera pose estimation. Finally, we incorporate RGRayDiffusion into the triplane-based SDF learning by introducing on-surface geometric regularization from the sampling points of the neural bundle rays, which leads to highly accurate pose-free surface reconstruction results even for sparse-view inputs. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that our GCRayDiffusion achieves more accurate camera pose estimation than previous approaches, with geometrically more consistent surface reconstruction results, especially given sparse-view inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, SAM incurs twice the computational cost compared to base optimizer (e.g., SGD). We propose Asymptotic Unbiased Sampling with respect to iterations to accelerate SAM (AUSAM), which maintains the model's generalization capacity while significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Concretely, we probabilistically sample a subset of data points beneficial for SAM optimization based on a theoretically guaranteed criterion, i.e., the Gradient Norm of each Sample (GNS). We further approximate the GNS by the difference in loss values before and after perturbation in SAM. As a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic method, our approach consistently accelerates SAM across a range of tasks and networks, i.e., classification, human pose estimation and network quantization. On CIFAR10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet, AUSAM achieves results comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of over 70%. Compared to recent dynamic data pruning methods, AUSAM is better suited for SAM and excels in maintaining performance. Additionally, AUSAM accelerates optimization in human pose estimation and model quantization without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NeRF-based Point Cloud Reconstruction using a Stationary Camera for Agricultural Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21958v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a NeRF-based framework for point cloud (PCD) reconstruction, specifically designed for indoor high-throughput plant phenotyping facilities. Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require cameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for high-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on conveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a variant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera to capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises COLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate camera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of Interest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of high-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate excellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an F-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose estimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup, overall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the method's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping applications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D reconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need for complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is especially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such as hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on optimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology to facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D phenotyping pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |

To achieve this, we train a transformer that takes an image as input and estimates the parameters of the model. Due to the lack of training data for this task, we build a pipeline to produce pseudo ground truth model parameters for single images and implement a training procedure that iteratively refines these pseudo labels. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for 3D human mesh recovery, our model achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, while it significantly outperforms them in settings with extreme 3D poses and viewpoints. Additionally, we show that previous reconstruction methods frequently violate joint angle limits, leading to unnatural rotations. In contrast, our approach leverages the biomechanically plausible degrees of freedom making more realistic joint rotation estimates. We validate our approach across multiple human pose estimation benchmarks.

| **[OccRobNet : Occlusion Robust Network for Accurate 3D Interacting Hand-Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21723v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occlusion is one of the challenging issues when estimating 3D hand pose. This problem becomes more prominent when hand interacts with an object or two hands are involved. In the past works, much attention has not been given to these occluded regions. But these regions contain important and beneficial information that is vital for 3D hand pose estimation. Thus, in this paper, we propose an occlusion robust and accurate method for the estimation of 3D hand-object pose from the input RGB image. Our method includes first localising the hand joints using a CNN based model and then refining them by extracting contextual information. The self attention transformer then identifies the specific joints along with the hand identity. This helps the model to identify the hand belongingness of a particular joint which helps to detect the joint even in the occluded region. Further, these joints with hand identity are then used to estimate the pose using cross attention mechanism. Thus, by identifying the joints in the occluded region, the obtained network becomes robust to occlusion. Hence, this network achieves state-of-the-art results when evaluated on the InterHand2.6M, HO3D and H$_2$O3D datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (NCC) 2025</p></details> | None |

Current SLAM approaches predominantly rely on geometric cues for mapping and localization, but they often fail to ensure semantic consistency, particularly in dynamic or densely populated scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce STAMICS, a novel method that integrates semantic information with 3D Gaussian representations to enhance both localization and mapping accuracy. STAMICS consists of three key components: a 3D Gaussian-based scene representation for high-fidelity reconstruction, a graph-based clustering technique that enforces temporal semantic consistency, and an open-vocabulary system that allows for the classification of unseen objects. Extensive experiments show that STAMICS significantly improves camera pose estimation and map quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while reducing reconstruction errors.

| **[Lidar-only Odometry based on Multiple Scan-to-Scan Alignments over a Moving Window](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21293v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lidar-only odometry considers the pose estimation of a mobile robot based on the accumulation of motion increments extracted from consecutive lidar scans. Many existing approaches to the problem use a scan-to-map registration, which neglects the accumulation of errors within the maintained map due to drift. Other methods use a refinement step that jointly optimizes the local map on a feature basis. We propose a solution that avoids this by using multiple independent scan-to-scan Iterative Closest Points (ICP) registrations to previous scans in order to derive constraints for a pose graph. The optimization of the pose graph then not only yields an accurate estimate for the latest pose, but also enables the refinement of previous scans in the optimization window. By avoiding the need to recompute the scan-to-scan alignments, the computational load is minimized. Extensive evaluation on the public KITTI and MulRan datasets as well as on a custom automotive lidar dataset is carried out. Results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy, while alleviating the mentioned issues.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Recurrent Feature Mining and Keypoint Mixup Padding for Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21140v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-agnostic pose estimation aims to locate keypoints on query images according to a few annotated support images for arbitrary novel classes. Existing methods generally extract support features via heatmap pooling, and obtain interacted features from support and query via cross-attention. Hence, these works neglect to mine fine-grained and structure-aware (FGSA) features from both support and query images, which are crucial for pixel-level keypoint localization. To this end, we propose a novel yet concise framework, which recurrently mines FGSA features from both support and query images. Specifically, we design a FGSA mining module based on deformable attention mechanism. On the one hand, we mine fine-grained features by applying deformable attention head over multi-scale feature maps. On the other hand, we mine structure-aware features by offsetting the reference points of keypoints to their linked keypoints. By means of above module, we recurrently mine FGSA features from support and query images, and thus obtain better support features and query estimations. In addition, we propose to use mixup keypoints to pad various classes to a unified keypoint number, which could provide richer supervision than the zero padding used in existing works. We conduct extensive experiments and in-depth studies on large-scale MP-100 dataset, and outperform SOTA method dramatically (+3.2\%PCK@0.05).

| **[RatBodyFormer: Rat Body Surface from Keypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09599v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing rat behavior lies at the heart of many scientific studies. Past methods for automated rodent modeling have focused on 3D pose estimation from keypoints, e.g., face and appendages. The pose, however, does not capture the rich body surface movement encoding the subtle rat behaviors like curling and stretching. The body surface lacks features that can be visually defined, evading these established keypoint-based methods. In this paper, we introduce the first method for reconstructing the rat body surface as a dense set of points by learning to predict it from the sparse keypoints that can be detected with past methods. Our method consists of two key contributions. The first is RatDome, a novel multi-camera system for rat behavior capture, and a large-scale dataset captured with it that consists of pairs of 3D keypoints and 3D body surface points. The second is RatBodyFormer, a novel network to transform detected keypoints to 3D body surface points. RatBodyFormer is agnostic to the exact locations of the 3D body surface points in the training data and is trained with masked-learning. We experimentally validate our framework with a number of real-world experiments. Our results collectively serve as a novel foundation for automated rat behavior analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://vision.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/research/ratbodyformer/</p></details> | None |

Inspired by this success, we investigate whether video generators similarly exhibit 3D-awareness. Using structure-from-motion as a 3D-aware task, we test if intermediate features of a video generator - OpenSora in our case - can support camera pose estimation. Surprisingly, at first, we only find a weak correlation between the two tasks. Deeper investigation reveals that although the video generator produces plausible video frames, the frames themselves are not truly 3D-consistent. Instead, we propose to jointly train for the two tasks, using photometric generation and 3D aware errors. Specifically, we find that SoTA video generation and camera pose estimation (i.e.,DUSt3R [79]) networks share common structures, and propose an architecture that unifies the two. The proposed unified model, named \nameMethod, produces camera pose estimates with competitive quality while producing 3D-consistent videos. In summary, we propose the first unified video generator that is 3D-consistent, generates realistic video frames, and can potentially be repurposed for other 3D-aware tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, there has been a notable gap in hand detection pipelines, posing significant challenges in constructing effective real-world multi-hand reconstruction systems. In this work, we present a data-driven pipeline for efficient multi-hand reconstruction in the wild. The proposed pipeline is composed of two components: a real-time fully convolutional hand localization and a high-fidelity transformer-based 3D hand reconstruction model. To tackle the limitations of previous methods and build a robust and stable detection network, we introduce a large-scale dataset with over than 2M in-the-wild hand images with diverse lighting, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Our approach outperforms previous methods in both efficiency and accuracy on popular 2D and 3D benchmarks.

We used 4500 annotated video-frames from 75 recordings of infant spontaneous motor functions from 4 to 26 weeks. To determine which pose estimation method and camera angle yield the best pose estimation accuracy on infants in a GMA related setting, the distance to human annotations and the percentage of correct key-points (PCK) were computed and compared. The results show that the best performing generic model trained on adults, ViTPose, also performs best on infants. We see no improvement from using infant-pose estimators over the generic pose estimators on our infant dataset. However, when retraining a generic model on our data, there is a significant improvement in pose estimation accuracy. The pose estimation accuracy obtained from the top-down view is significantly better than that obtained from the diagonal view, especially for the detection of the hip key-points. The results also indicate limited generalization capabilities of infant-pose estimators to other infant datasets, which hints that one should be careful when choosing infant pose estimators and using them on infant datasets which they were not trained on. While the standard GMA method uses a diagonal view for assessment, pose estimation accuracy significantly improves using a top-down view. This suggests that a top-down view should be included in recording setups for automated GMA research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20220v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity.</p></details> |  | None |

Here, we propose that combining visual information and proprioception with binary, low-resolution tactile contact measurements from across the interior surface of an articulated robotic hand can mitigate this issue. The visuo-tactile object-pose-estimation problem is formulated probabilistically in a factor graph. The pose of the object is optimized to align with the three kinds of measurements using a robust cost function to reduce the influence of visual or tactile outlier readings. The advantages of the proposed approach are first demonstrated in simulation: a custom 15-DoF robot hand with one binary tactile sensor per link grasps 17 YCB objects while observed by an RGB-D camera. This low-resolution in-hand tactile sensing significantly improves object-pose estimates under high occlusion and also high visual noise. We also show these benefits through grasping tests with a preliminary real version of our tactile hand, obtaining reasonable visuo-tactile estimates of object pose at approximately 13.3 Hz on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> | None |

To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel dataset DynOPETs and a dedicated data acquisition and annotation pipeline tailored for object pose estimation and tracking in such unconstrained environments. Our efficient annotation method innovatively integrates pose estimation and pose tracking techniques to generate pseudo-labels, which are subsequently refined through pose graph optimization. The resulting dataset offers accurate pose annotations for dynamic objects observed from moving cameras. To validate the effectiveness and value of our dataset, we perform comprehensive evaluations using 18 state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential to accelerate research in this challenging domain.

Current fall detection solutions typically rely on sensor-based systems that require dedicated hardware, or on video-based models that demand high computational resources and GPUs for real-time processing. In contrast, this paper presents a robust fall detection system that does not require any additional sensors or high-powered hardware. The system uses pose estimation techniques, combined with threshold-based analysis and a voting mechanism, to effectively distinguish between fall and non-fall activities. For pose detection, we leverage MediaPipe, a lightweight and efficient framework that enables real-time processing on standard CPUs with minimal computational overhead. By analyzing motion, body position, and key pose points, the system processes pose features with a 20-frame buffer, minimizing false positives and maintaining high accuracy even in real-world settings. This unobtrusive, resource-efficient approach provides a practical solution for enhancing resident safety in old age homes, without the need for expensive sensors or high-end computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 Pag...</summary><p>4 Pages, 2 figures, 2 code block, 1 flow chart</p></details> | None |

Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow sensing Field-of-View (FoV), resulting in degenerated accuracy and limited robustness in textureless environments. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy with much wider FoV. However, the usual arbitrary placement and orientation of multiple cameras make the pose scale estimation and system updating challenging. To address these problems, we propose a robust visual odometry system for rigidly-bundled arbitrarily-arranged multi-cameras, namely MCVO, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams to GPU. Then we initialize the odometry system with the metric-scale poses under the rigid constraints between moving cameras. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate its robustness over arbitrarily arranged cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose accuracy with better generalization ability.

Conventional PSE methods relying on modalities such as RGB-D, infrared, or pressure maps often struggle with occlusions caused by bedding and complex patient positioning, leading to inaccurate estimation that can affect clinical outcomes. To address these challenges, we present the first multi-modal in-bed patient 3D PSE network that fuses detailed geometric features extracted from routinely acquired computed tomography (CT) scans with depth maps (mPSE-CT). mPSE-CT incorporates a shape estimation module that utilizes probabilistic correspondence alignment, a pose estimation module with a refined neural network, and a final parameters mixing module. This multi-modal network robustly reconstructs occluded body regions and enhances the accuracy of the estimated 3D human mesh model. We validated mPSE-CT using proprietary whole-body rigid phantom and volunteer datasets in clinical scenarios. mPSE-CT outperformed the best-performing prior method by 23% and 49.16% in pose and shape estimation respectively, demonstrating its potential for improving clinical outcomes in challenging perioperative environments.</p></details> |  | None |

STDLoc is a full relocalization pipeline that can achieve accurate relocalization without relying on any pose prior.

Based on this scene representation, we introduce a novel matching-oriented Gaussian sampling strategy and a scene-specific detector to achieve efficient and robust initial pose estimation. Furthermore, based on the initial localization results, we align the query feature map to the Gaussian feature field by dense feature matching to enable accurate localization. The experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that STDLoc outperforms current state-of-the-art localization methods in terms of localization accuracy and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a matching-aware pose estimation network and a depth refinement module to enhance geometry consistency across views, ensuring more accurate and stable 3D reconstructions. To present the performance of our method, we evaluated it on large-scale real-world datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. SelfSplat achieves superior results over previous state-of-the-art methods in both appearance and geometry quality, also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization capabilities. Extensive ablation studies and analysis also validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Face recognition and body pose estimation have achieved state-of-the-art performance using synthetic training data alone, but for the hand, there is still a large synthetic-to-real gap. This paper presents the first systematic study of the synthetic-to-real gap of 3D hand pose estimation. We analyze the gap and identify key components such as the forearm, image frequency statistics, hand pose, and object occlusions. To facilitate our analysis, we propose a data synthesis pipeline to synthesize high-quality data. We demonstrate that synthetic hand data can achieve the same level of accuracy as real data when integrating our identified components, paving the path to use synthetic data alone for hand pose estimation.

| **[Relative Pose Estimation through Affine Corrections of Monocular Depth Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05446v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models have undergone significant advancements over recent years. Many MDE models aim to predict affine-invariant relative depth from monocular images, while recent developments in large-scale training and vision foundation models enable reasonable estimation of metric (absolute) depth. However, effectively leveraging these predictions for geometric vision tasks, in particular relative pose estimation, remains relatively under explored. While depths provide rich constraints for cross-view image alignment, the intrinsic noise and ambiguity from the monocular depth priors present practical challenges to improving upon classic keypoint-based solutions. In this paper, we develop three solvers for relative pose estimation that explicitly account for independent affine (scale and shift) ambiguities, covering both calibrated and uncalibrated conditions. We further propose a hybrid estimation pipeline that combines our proposed solvers with classic point-based solvers and epipolar constraints. We find that the affine correction modeling is beneficial to not only the relative depth priors but also, surprisingly, the "metric" ones. Results across multiple datasets demonstrate large improvements of our approach over classic keypoint-based baselines and PnP-based solutions, under both calibrated and uncalibrated setups. We also show that our method improves consistently with different feature matchers and MDE models, and can further benefit from very recent advances on both modules.

| **[Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning for Relative Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18671v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relative pose estimation provides a promising way for achieving object-agnostic pose estimation. Despite the success of existing 3D correspondence-based methods, the reliance on explicit feature matching suffers from small overlaps in visible regions and unreliable feature estimation for invisible regions. Inspired by humans' ability to assemble two object parts that have small or no overlapping regions by considering object structure, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning method for Relative Pose Estimation, which consists of two key modules. First, a structure-aware keypoint extraction module is designed to locate a set of kepoints that can represent the structure of objects with different shapes and appearance, under the guidance of a keypoint based image reconstruction loss. Second, a structure-aware correspondence estimation module is designed to model the intra-image and inter-image relationships between keypoints to extract structure-aware features for correspondence estimation. By jointly leveraging these two modules, the proposed method can naturally estimate 3D-3D correspondences for unseen objects without explicit feature matching for precise relative pose estimation. Experimental results on the CO3D, Objaverse and LineMOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior methods, i.e., with 5.7{\deg}reduction in mean angular error on the CO3D dataset.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |

While recent advances leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity and real-time rendering, existing methods are often specialized and task-focused, lacking a unified framework for both generation and editing. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a comprehensive framework that addresses this gap by enabling direct 3DGS generation and editing. SplatFlow comprises two main components: a multi-view rectified flow (RF) model and a Gaussian Splatting Decoder (GSDecoder). The multi-view RF model operates in latent space, generating multi-view images, depths, and camera poses simultaneously, conditioned on text prompts, thus addressing challenges like diverse scene scales and complex camera trajectories in real-world settings. Then, the GSDecoder efficiently translates these latent outputs into 3DGS representations through a feed-forward 3DGS method. Leveraging training-free inversion and inpainting techniques, SplatFlow enables seamless 3DGS editing and supports a broad range of 3D tasks-including object editing, novel view synthesis, and camera pose estimation-within a unified framework without requiring additional complex pipelines. We validate SplatFlow's capabilities on the MVImgNet and DL3DV-7K datasets, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various 3D generation, editing, and inpainting-based tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://gohyojun15.github.io/SplatFlow/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://gohyojun15.github.io/SplatFlow) |

However, existing datasets and methodologies primarily target mainstream team sports such as soccer and conventional 5-on-5 basketball, often overlooking scenarios involving fixed-camera setups commonly used at amateur levels, less mainstream sports, or datasets that explicitly incorporate pose annotations. In this paper, we propose the TrackID3x3 dataset, the first publicly available comprehensive dataset specifically designed for multi-player tracking, player identification, and pose estimation in 3x3 basketball scenarios. The dataset comprises three distinct subsets (Indoor fixed-camera, Outdoor fixed-camera, and Drone camera footage), capturing diverse full-court camera perspectives and environments. We also introduce the Track-ID task, a simplified variant of the game state reconstruction task that excludes field detection and focuses exclusively on fixed-camera scenarios. To evaluate performance, we propose a baseline algorithm called Track-ID algorithm, tailored to assess tracking and identification quality. Furthermore, our benchmark experiments, utilizing recent multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., BoT-SORT-ReID) and top-down pose estimation methods (HRNet, RTMPose, and SwinPose), demonstrate robust results and highlight remaining challenges. Our dataset and evaluation benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing automated analytics in 3x3 basketball.

Previous methods either treat the information equally or require the explicit storage of the entire context, tending to be laborious in real-world scenarios. Inspired by Mamba's inherent selectivity, we propose \textbf{CorrMamba}, a \textbf{Corr}espondence filter leveraging \textbf{Mamba}'s ability to selectively mine information from true correspondences while mitigating interference from false ones, thus achieving adaptive focus at a lower cost. To prevent Mamba from being potentially impacted by unordered keypoints that obscured its ability to mine spatial information, we customize a causal sequential learning approach based on the Gumbel-Softmax technique to establish causal dependencies between features in a fully autonomous and differentiable manner. Additionally, a local-context enhancement module is designed to capture critical contextual cues essential for correspondence pruning, complementing the core framework. Extensive experiments on relative pose estimation, visual localization, and analysis demonstrate that CorrMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, in outdoor relative pose estimation, our method surpasses the previous SOTA by $2.58$ absolute percentage points in AUC@20\textdegree, highlighting its practical superiority.

In this work, we analyze camera motion from a first principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera manipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that motion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This motivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating training convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by probing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we observe that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and only a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This suggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the architecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to a 4x reduction of training parameters, improved training speed, and 10% higher visual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control learning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse, dynamic videos with stationary cameras. This helps the model distinguish between camera and scene motion and improves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos. We compound these findings to design the Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture, the new state-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project Page: https://snap-research.github.io/ac3d/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://snap-research.github.io/ac3d) |

Our method requires only the CAD model of the target object and can precisely estimate its pose without any additional fine-tuning. While existing model-based methods suffer from inefficiency due to using a large number of templates, our method enables fast and accurate estimation with a small number of templates. This improvement is achieved by finding semi-dense correspondences between the input image and the pre-rendered templates. Our method achieves strong generalization performance by leveraging a hybrid representation that combines patch-level classification and offset regression. Additionally, our pose refinement model estimates probabilistic flow between the input image and the rendered image, refining the initial estimate to an accurate pose using a differentiable PnP layer. We demonstrate that our method not only estimates object poses rapidly but also outperforms existing methods by a large margin on the seven core datasets of the BOP Challenge, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[GDRNPP: A Geometry-guided and Fully Learning-based Object Pose Estimator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12145v5)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D pose estimation of rigid objects is a long-standing and challenging task in computer vision. Recently, the emergence of deep learning reveals the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict reliable 6D poses. Given that direct pose regression networks currently exhibit suboptimal performance, most methods still resort to traditional techniques to varying degrees. For example, top-performing methods often adopt an indirect strategy by first establishing 2D-3D or 3D-3D correspondences followed by applying the RANSAC-based PnP or Kabsch algorithms, and further employing ICP for refinement. Despite the performance enhancement, the integration of traditional techniques makes the networks time-consuming and not end-to-end trainable. Orthogonal to them, this paper introduces a fully learning-based object pose estimator. In this work, we first perform an in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect methods and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDRN) to learn the 6D pose from monocular images in an end-to-end manner. Afterwards, we introduce a geometry-guided pose refinement module, enhancing pose accuracy when extra depth data is available. Guided by the predicted coordinate map, we build an end-to-end differentiable architecture that establishes robust and accurate 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and rendered RGB-D images to refine the pose. Our enhanced pose estimation pipeline GDRNPP (GDRN Plus Plus) conquered the leaderboard of the BOP Challenge for two consecutive years, becoming the first to surpass all prior methods that relied on traditional techniques in both accuracy and speed.

Unlike previous feed-forward models that lack any mechanism to exploit known camera or scene priors at test time, Pow3r incorporates any combination of auxiliary information such as intrinsics, relative pose, dense or sparse depth, alongside input images, within a single network. Building upon the recent DUSt3R paradigm, a transformer-based architecture that leverages powerful pre-training, our lightweight and versatile conditioning acts as additional guidance for the network to predict more accurate estimates when auxiliary information is available. During training we feed the model with random subsets of modalities at each iteration, which enables the model to operate under different levels of known priors at test time. This in turn opens up new capabilities, such as performing inference in native image resolution, or point-cloud completion. Our experiments on 3D reconstruction, depth completion, multi-view depth prediction, multi-view stereo, and multi-view pose estimation tasks yield state-of-the-art results and confirm the effectiveness of Pow3r at exploiting all available information.

There is rapid development of human pose estimation methods in computer vision thanks to advances in deep learning and machine learning. However, these methods are trained on datasets that feature adults in different contexts. This work tests and compares seven popular methods (AlphaPose, DeepLabCut/DeeperCut, Detectron2, HRNet, MediaPipe/BlazePose, OpenPose, and ViTPose) on videos of infants in supine position and in more complex settings. Surprisingly, all methods except DeepLabCut and MediaPipe have competitive performance without additional finetuning, with ViTPose performing best. Next to standard performance metrics (average precision and recall), we introduce errors expressed in the neck-mid-hip (torso length) ratio and additionally study missed and redundant detections, and the reliability of the internal confidence ratings of the different methods, which are relevant for downstream tasks.

This paper challenges the problem by efficient prompt learning for Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models, \textit{e.g.} CLIP, aiming to resolve the cross-species generalization problem. At the core of the solution lies in the prompt designing, probabilistic prompt modeling and cross-modal adaptation, thereby enabling prompts to compensate for cross-modal information and effectively overcome large data variances under unbalanced data distribution. To this end, we propose a novel probabilistic prompting approach to fully explore textual descriptions, which could alleviate the diversity issues caused by long-tail property and increase the adaptability of prompts on unseen category instance. Specifically, we first introduce a set of learnable prompts and propose a diversity loss to maintain distinctiveness among prompts, thus representing diverse image attributes. Diverse textual probabilistic representations are sampled and used as the guidance for the pose estimation. Subsequently, we explore three different cross-modal fusion strategies at spatial level to alleviate the adverse impacts of visual uncertainty.

In response, RGB-based methods have been developed. Among these methods, geometry-guided pose regression that originated from instance-level tasks has demonstrated strong performance. However, we argue that the NOCS map is an inadequate intermediate representation for geometry-guided pose regression method, as its many-to-one correspondence with category-level pose introduces redundant instance-specific information, resulting in suboptimal results. This paper identifies the intra-class variation problem inherent in pose regression based solely on the NOCS map and proposes the Intra-class Variation-Free Consensus (IVFC) map, a novel coordinate representation generated from the category-level consensus model. By leveraging the complementary strengths of the NOCS map and the IVFC map, we introduce GIVEPose, a framework that implements Gradual Intra-class Variation Elimination for category-level object pose estimation.

We are inspired by the fact that the human brain exploits spatiotemporal continuity and performs concurrent localization and pose estimation despite the specialization of brain areas for form and motion processing. Traditional discriminative models typically require predefined target states for determining model weights, a challenge we address through Gaussian Map Soft Prediction (GMSP) and Offset Map Regression Adapter (OMRA) Modules. These modules remove the necessity of keypoint target states as input, streamlining the process. Our method starts with a known target state in the initial frame of a given video sequence. It then seamlessly tracks the target and estimates keypoints of anatomical importance as output for subsequent frames. Unlike prevalent top-down pose estimation methods, our approach doesn't rely on per-frame target detections due to its tracking capability. This facilitates a significant advancement in inference efficiency and potential applications. We train and validate our approach on datasets encompassing diverse species. Our experiments demonstrate superior results compared to existing methods, opening doors to various applications, including but not limited to action recognition and behavioral analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Among these descriptors, GeDi has demonstrated strong zero-shot 6D pose estimation capabilities but remains computationally impractical for real-world applications due to its expensive inference process. Can we retain GeDi's effectiveness while significantly improving its efficiency? In this paper, we explore this question by introducing a knowledge distillation framework that trains an efficient student model to regress local descriptors from a GeDi teacher. Our key contributions include: an efficient large-scale training procedure that ensures robustness to occlusions and partial observations while operating under compute and storage constraints, and a novel loss formulation that handles weak supervision from non-distinctive teacher descriptors. We validate our approach on five BOP Benchmark datasets and demonstrate a significant reduction in inference time while maintaining competitive performance with existing methods, bringing zero-shot 6D pose estimation closer to real-time feasibility.

Given the challenges in obtaining ground truth data, there has been an increasing focus on self-supervised learning (SSL) for endoscopic depth estimation as a basis for scene reconstruction. While foundation models have shown remarkable progress in visual tasks, their direct application to the medical domain often leads to suboptimal results. However, the visual features from these models can still enhance endoscopic tasks, emphasizing the need for efficient adaptation strategies, which still lack exploration currently. In this paper, we introduce Endo3DAC, a unified framework for endoscopic scene reconstruction that efficiently adapts foundation models. We design an integrated network capable of simultaneously estimating depth maps, relative poses, and camera intrinsic parameters. By freezing the backbone foundation model and training only the specially designed Gated Dynamic Vector-Based Low-Rank Adaptation (GDV-LoRA) with separate decoder heads, Endo3DAC achieves superior depth and pose estimation while maintaining training efficiency. Additionally, we propose a 3D scene reconstruction pipeline that optimizes depth maps' scales, shifts, and a few parameters based on our integrated network. Extensive experiments across four endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo3DAC significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer trainable parameters. To our knowledge, we are the first to utilize a single network that only requires surgical videos to perform both SSL depth estimation and scene reconstruction tasks. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> | None |

Current leading methods such as DUSt3R employ a fundamentally pairwise approach, processing images in pairs and necessitating costly global alignment procedures to reconstruct from multiple views. In this work, we propose Fast 3D Reconstruction (Fast3R), a novel multi-view generalization to DUSt3R that achieves efficient and scalable 3D reconstruction by processing many views in parallel. Fast3R's Transformer-based architecture forwards N images in a single forward pass, bypassing the need for iterative alignment. Through extensive experiments on camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction, Fast3R demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in inference speed and reduced error accumulation. These results establish Fast3R as a robust alternative for multi-view applications, offering enhanced scalability without compromising reconstruction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Accurate and robust registration methods are essential for aligning data from different modalities, forming the foundation for multimodal sensor data fusion and enhancing perception systems' accuracy and reliability. The registration task between 2D images captured by cameras and 3D point clouds captured by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors is usually treated as a visual pose estimation problem. High-dimensional feature similarities from different modalities are leveraged to identify pixel-point correspondences, followed by pose estimation techniques using least squares methods. However, existing approaches often resort to downsampling the original point cloud and image data due to computational constraints, inevitably leading to a loss in precision. Additionally, high-dimensional features extracted using different feature extractors from various modalities require specific techniques to mitigate cross-modal differences for effective matching. To address these challenges, we propose a method that uses edge information from the original point clouds and images for cross-modal registration. We retain crucial information from the original data by extracting edge points and pixels, enhancing registration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The use of edge points and edge pixels allows us to introduce an attention-based feature exchange block to eliminate cross-modal disparities. Furthermore, we incorporate an optimal matching layer to improve correspondence identification. We validate the accuracy of our method on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Shape-Independent Transformation via Spherical Representations for Category-Level Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13926v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level object pose estimation aims to determine the pose and size of novel objects in specific categories. Existing correspondence-based approaches typically adopt point-based representations to establish the correspondences between primitive observed points and normalized object coordinates. However, due to the inherent shape-dependence of canonical coordinates, these methods suffer from semantic incoherence across diverse object shapes. To resolve this issue, we innovatively leverage the sphere as a shared proxy shape of objects to learn shape-independent transformation via spherical representations. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel architecture called SpherePose, which yields precise correspondence prediction through three core designs. Firstly, We endow the point-wise feature extraction with SO(3)-invariance, which facilitates robust mapping between camera coordinate space and object coordinate space regardless of rotation transformation. Secondly, the spherical attention mechanism is designed to propagate and integrate features among spherical anchors from a comprehensive perspective, thus mitigating the interference of noise and incomplete point cloud. Lastly, a hyperbolic correspondence loss function is designed to distinguish subtle distinctions, which can promote the precision of correspondence prediction. Experimental results on CAMERA25, REAL275 and HouseCat6D benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method, verifying the effectiveness of spherical representations and architectural innovations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025.

| **[HandOS: 3D Hand Reconstruction in One Stage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01537v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches of hand reconstruction predominantly adhere to a multi-stage framework, encompassing detection, left-right classification, and pose estimation. This paradigm induces redundant computation and cumulative errors. In this work, we propose HandOS, an end-to-end framework for 3D hand reconstruction. Our central motivation lies in leveraging a frozen detector as the foundation while incorporating auxiliary modules for 2D and 3D keypoint estimation. In this manner, we integrate the pose estimation capacity into the detection framework, while at the same time obviating the necessity of using the left-right category as a prerequisite. Specifically, we propose an interactive 2D-3D decoder, where 2D joint semantics is derived from detection cues while 3D representation is lifted from those of 2D joints. Furthermore, hierarchical attention is designed to enable the concurrent modeling of 2D joints, 3D vertices, and camera translation. Consequently, we achieve an end-to-end integration of hand detection, 2D pose estimation, and 3D mesh reconstruction within a one-stage framework, so that the above multi-stage drawbacks are overcome. Meanwhile, the HandOS reaches state-of-the-art performances on public benchmarks, e.g., 5.0 PA-MPJPE on FreiHand and 64.6\% PCK@0.05 on HInt-Ego4D.

Primarily, this comparative analysis aims to validate the use of marker-less MoCap techniques in a clinical setting by showing that these marker-less techniques are within a reasonable range for kinematics analysis compared to the more cumbersome and less portable state-of-the-art tools. Not only does marker-less motion capture using human pose estimation produce results in-line with the results of both the IMU and MoCap kinematics but also benefits from a reduced set-up time and reduced practical knowledge and expertise to set up. Overall, while there is still room for improvement when it comes to the quality of the data produced, we believe that this compromise is within the room of error that these low-speed actions that are used in small clinical tests.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we tackle image restoration from a different perspective by jointly denoising multiple photographs of the same scene. Our core hypothesis is that degraded images capturing a shared scene contain complementary information that, when combined, better constrains the restoration problem. To this end, we implement a powerful multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates uncorrupted views by extracting rich information from multi-view relationships. Our experiments show that our multi-view approach outperforms existing single-view image and even video-based methods on image deblurring and super-resolution tasks. Critically, our model is trained to output 3D consistent images, making it a promising tool for applications requiring robust multi-view integration, such as 3D reconstruction or pose estimation.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite recent advancements in foundation model adaptation to monocular depth estimation of endoscopic scenes via self-supervised learning (SSL), no prior work has explored their use for pose estimation. These methods rely on low rank-based adaptation approaches, which constrain model updates to a low-rank space. We propose Endo-FASt3r, the first monocular SSL depth and pose estimation framework that uses foundation models for both tasks. We extend the Reloc3r relative pose estimation foundation model by designing Reloc3rX, introducing modifications necessary for convergence in SSL. We also present DoMoRA, a novel adaptation technique that enables higher-rank updates and faster convergence. Experiments on the SCARED dataset show that Endo-FASt3r achieves a substantial $10\%$ improvement in pose estimation and a $2\%$ improvement in depth estimation over prior work.

SCJD introduces Sparse Correlation Input Sequence Downsampling to reduce redundancy in student network inputs while preserving inter-frame correlations. For effective knowledge transfer, we propose Dynamic Joint Spatial Attention Distillation, which includes Dynamic Joint Embedding Distillation to enhance the student's feature representation using the teacher's multi-frame context feature, and Adjacent Joint Attention Distillation to improve the student network's focus on adjacent joint relationships for better spatial understanding. Additionally, Temporal Consistency Distillation aligns the temporal correlations between teacher and student networks through upsampling and global supervision.

Traditional methods using markers for hand-eye calibration require offline image collection, limiting their suitability for online self-calibration. Recent learning-based robot pose estimation methods, while advancing online calibration, struggle with cross-robot generalization and require the robot to be fully visible. This work proposes a Foundation feature-driven online End-Effector Pose Estimation (FEEPE) algorithm, characterized by its training-free and cross end-effector generalization capabilities. Inspired by the zero-shot generalization capabilities of foundation models, FEEPE leverages pre-trained visual features to estimate 2D-3D correspondences derived from the CAD model and target image, enabling 6D pose estimation via the PnP algorithm. To resolve ambiguities from partial observations and symmetry, a multi-historical key frame enhanced pose optimization algorithm is introduced, utilizing temporal information for improved accuracy. Compared to traditional hand-eye calibration, FEEPE enables marker-free online calibration. Unlike robot pose estimation, it generalizes across robots and end-effectors in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior flexibility, generalization, and performance.</p></details> |  | None |

For instance, DUSt3R has recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction, and showing that one can reduce all the key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem, namely, the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce the Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image, one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object, and the other to a canonical version of the object at rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction, seeing through self-occlusions to obtain the complete shape of the object. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation reduce to the prediction of the DualPMs. We demonstrate empirically that this representation is a good target for a deep network to predict; specifically, we consider modeling horses, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on 3D synthetic data, consisting of a single model of a horse, while generalizing very well to real images. With this, we improve by a large margin previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of this type of objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

Technically, we design a grasp-aware feature fusion module to integrate hand-object features with an object switcher to dynamically control the hand-object pose estimation according to grasping status. Further, to uplift the robustness of hand pose estimation regardless of object presence, we generate realistic de-occluded image pairs to train the model to learn object-induced hand occlusions, and formulate multi-level feature enhancement techniques for learning occlusion-invariant features.

ClassroomKD comprises two main modules: the Knowledge Filtering (KF) module and the Mentoring module. The KF Module dynamically ranks mentors based on their performance for each input, activating only high-quality mentors to minimize error accumulation and prevent information loss. The Mentoring Module adjusts the distillation strategy by tuning each mentor's influence according to the dynamic performance gap between the student and mentors, effectively modulating the learning pace. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and 2D human pose estimation (COCO Keypoints and MPII Human Pose) demonstrate that ClassroomKD outperforms existing knowledge distillation methods for different network architectures.

This paper introduces a novel uncertainty-aware end-to-end Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework focused on keypoint-based 6DoF pose estimation. Keypoints predicted by a large teacher model exhibit varying levels of uncertainty that can be exploited within the distillation process to enhance the accuracy of the student model while ensuring its compactness. To this end, we propose a distillation strategy that aligns the student and teacher predictions by adjusting the knowledge transfer based on the uncertainty associated with each teacher keypoint prediction. Additionally, the proposed KD leverages this uncertainty-aware alignment of keypoints to transfer the knowledge at key locations of their respective feature maps. Experiments on the widely-used LINEMOD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving superior 6DoF object pose estimation with lightweight models compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

To simplify reference acquisition, we aim to estimate the unseen object's pose through a single unposed RGB-D reference image. While previous works leverage reference images as pose anchors to limit the range of relative pose, our scenario presents significant challenges since the relative transformation could vary across the entire SE(3) space. Moreover, factors like occlusion, sensor noise, and extreme geometry could result in low viewpoint overlap. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach and benchmark, termed UNOPose, for unseen one-reference-based object pose estimation. Building upon a coarse-to-fine paradigm, UNOPose constructs an SE(3)-invariant reference frame to standardize object representation despite pose and size variations. To alleviate small overlap across viewpoints, we recalibrate the weight of each correspondence based on its predicted likelihood of being within the overlapping region. Evaluated on our proposed benchmark based on the BOP Challenge, UNOPose demonstrates superior performance, significantly outperforming traditional and learning-based methods in the one-reference setting and remaining competitive with CAD-model-based methods.

Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints.

However, completing partially observable objects while ensuring consistency across video frames remains challenging for existing models, especially for unstructured, in-the-wild videos. This paper tackles the task of Video Amodal Completion (VAC), which aims to generate the complete object consistently throughout the video given a visual prompt specifying the object of interest. Leveraging the rich, consistent manifolds learned by pre-trained video diffusion models, we propose a conditional diffusion model, TACO, that repurposes these manifolds for VAC. To enable its effective and robust generalization to challenging in-the-wild scenarios, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset with multiple difficulty levels by systematically imposing occlusions onto un-occluded videos. Building on this, we devise a progressive fine-tuning paradigm that starts with simpler recovery tasks and gradually advances to more complex ones. We demonstrate TACO's versatility on a wide range of in-the-wild videos from Internet, as well as on diverse, unseen datasets commonly used in autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene understanding. Moreover, we show that TACO can be effectively applied to various downstream tasks like object reconstruction and pose estimation, highlighting its potential to facilitate physical world understanding and reasoning.

| **[DVMNet++: Rethinking Relative Pose Estimation for Unseen Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13683v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the relative pose of a previously unseen object between two images is pivotal to the success of generalizable object pose estimation. Existing approaches typically predict 3D translation utilizing the ground-truth object bounding box and approximate 3D rotation with a large number of discrete hypotheses. This strategy makes unrealistic assumptions about the availability of ground truth and incurs a computationally expensive process of scoring each hypothesis at test time. By contrast, we rethink the problem of relative pose estimation for unseen objects by presenting a Deep Voxel Matching Network (DVMNet++). Our method computes the relative object pose in a single pass, eliminating the need for ground-truth object bounding boxes and rotation hypotheses. We achieve open-set object detection by leveraging image feature embedding and natural language understanding as reference. The detection result is then employed to approximate the translation parameters and crop the object from the query image. For rotation estimation, we map the two RGB images, i.e., reference and cropped query, to their respective voxelized 3D representations. The resulting voxels are passed through a rotation estimation module, which aligns the voxels and computes the rotation in an end-to-end fashion by solving a least-squares problem. To enhance robustness, we introduce a weighted closest voxel algorithm capable of mitigating the impact of noisy voxels. We conduct extensive experiments on the CO3D, Objaverse, LINEMOD, and LINEMOD-O datasets, demonstrating that our approach delivers more accurate relative pose estimates for novel objects at a lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Existing works propose training-heavy methods relying on either expensive yet inaccurate real-world annotations or controllable yet monotonous synthetic data that do not generalize well to unseen objects or domains. We present Diorama, the first zero-shot open-world system that holistically models 3D scenes from single-view RGB observations without requiring end-to-end training or human annotations. We show the feasibility of our approach by decomposing the problem into subtasks and introduce robust, generalizable solutions to each: architecture reconstruction, 3D shape retrieval, object pose estimation, and scene layout optimization. We evaluate our system on both synthetic and real-world data to show we significantly outperform baselines from prior work. We also demonstrate generalization to internet images and the text-to-scene task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bring Your Rear Cameras for Egocentric 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11652v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric 3D human pose estimation has been actively studied using cameras installed in front of a head-mounted device (HMD). While frontal placement is the optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it remains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion and limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods often fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD users tilt their heads upward (a common motion in human activities). A key limitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body, despite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this paper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras in the HMD design for full-body tracking. We also show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal for existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors without effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a new transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with multi-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose tracking. Moreover, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and Ego4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new camera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose tracking compared to only frontal placements. The proposed method achieves significant improvement over the current state of the art (>10% on MPJPE). We will release the source code, trained models, and new datasets on our project page https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/EgoRear/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/EgoRear/</p></details> | None |

Ground truth 2D poses are used for adaptation, but only estimated 2D poses are available in practice. This paper addresses adapting models to streaming videos with estimated 2D poses. Comparing adaptations reveals the challenge of limiting estimation errors while preserving accurate pose information. To this end, we propose adaptive aggregation, a two-stage optimization, and local augmentation for handling varying levels of estimated pose error. First, we perform adaptive aggregation across videos to initialize the model state with labeled representative samples. Within each video, we use a two-stage optimization to benefit from 2D fitting while minimizing the impact of erroneous updates. Second, we employ local augmentation, using adjacent confident samples to update the model before adapting to the current non-confident sample. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art by a large margin, advancing adaptation towards more practical settings of using estimated 2D poses.</p></details> |  | None |

Pre-training with large-scale images achieves promising results in various tasks, but prior methods for 3D hand pose pre-training have not fully utilized the potential of diverse hand images accessible from in-the-wild videos. To facilitate scalable pre-training, we first prepare an extensive pool of hand images from in-the-wild videos and design our pre-training method with contrastive learning. Specifically, we collect over 2.0M hand images from recent human-centric videos, such as 100DOH and Ego4D. To extract discriminative information from these images, we focus on the similarity of hands: pairs of non-identical samples with similar hand poses. We then propose a novel contrastive learning method that embeds similar hand pairs closer in the feature space. Our method not only learns from similar samples but also adaptively weights the contrastive learning loss based on inter-sample distance, leading to additional performance gains. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional contrastive learning approaches that produce positive pairs sorely from a single image with data augmentation. We achieve significant improvements over the state-of-the-art method (PeCLR) in various datasets, with gains of 15% on FreiHand, 10% on DexYCB, and 4% on AssemblyHands.

| **[Fast and Robust Localization for Humanoid Soccer Robot via Iterative Landmark Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11020v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate robot localization is essential for effective operation. Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is commonly used with known maps but is computationally expensive due to landmark matching for each particle. Humanoid robots face additional challenges, including sensor noise from locomotion vibrations and a limited field of view (FOV) due to camera placement. This paper proposes a fast and robust localization method via iterative landmark matching (ILM) for humanoid robots. The iterative matching process improves the accuracy of the landmark association so that it does not need MCL to match landmarks to particles. Pose estimation with the outlier removal process enhances its robustness to measurement noise and faulty detections. Furthermore, an additional filter can be utilized to fuse inertial data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and pose data from localization. We compared ILM with Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which shows that ILM method is more robust towards the error in the initial guess and easier to get a correct matching. We also compared ILM with the Augmented Monte Carlo Localization (aMCL), which shows that ILM method is much faster than aMCL and even more accurate. The proposed method's effectiveness is thoroughly evaluated through experiments and validated on the humanoid robot ARTEMIS during RoboCup 2024 adult-sized soccer competition.</p></details> |  | None |

This task is particularly challenging due to changes in appearance, such as clothing, hairstyle, and accessories. We propose a Clothes-Changing ReID method that uses only skeleton data and does not use appearance features. Traditional ReID methods often depend on appearance features, leading to decreased accuracy when clothing changes. Our approach utilizes a spatio-temporal Graph Convolution Network (GCN) encoder to generate a skeleton-based descriptor for each individual. During testing, we improve accuracy by aggregating predictions from multiple segments of a video clip. Evaluated on the CCVID dataset with several different pose estimation models, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a robust and efficient solution for Clothes-Changing ReID.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Consistent multi-animal pose estimation in cattle using dynamic Kalman filter based tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10450v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, studying animal behaviour with the help of computer vision has become more popular. Replacing human observers by computer vision lowers the cost of data collection and therefore allows to collect more extensive datasets. However, the majority of available computer vision algorithms to study animal behaviour is highly tailored towards a single research objective, limiting possibilities for data reuse. In this perspective, pose-estimation in combination with animal tracking offers opportunities to yield a higher level representation capturing both the spatial and temporal component of animal behaviour. Such a higher level representation allows to answer a wide variety of research questions simultaneously, without the need to develop repeatedly tailored computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we therefore first cope with several weaknesses of current pose-estimation algorithms and thereafter introduce KeySORT (Keypoint Simple and Online Realtime Tracking). KeySORT deploys an adaptive Kalman filter to construct tracklets in a bounding-box free manner, significantly improving the temporal consistency of detected keypoints. In this paper, we focus on pose estimation in cattle, but our methodology can easily be generalised to any other animal species. Our test results indicate our algorithm is able to detect up to 80% of the ground truth keypoints with high accuracy, with only a limited drop in performance when daylight recordings are compared to nightvision recordings. Moreover, by using KeySORT to construct skeletons, the temporal consistency of generated keypoint coordinates was largely improved, offering opportunities with regard to automated behaviour monitoring of animals.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

The core of our method lies in a novel transformer-based network architecture. In particular, our model starts with an image encoder that maps each image to a list of visual tokens. All visual tokens are concatenated with additional inserted learnable camera tokens. The obtained tokens then fully communicate with each other within a tailored transformer decoder. The camera tokens causally aggregate features from visual tokens of different views, and further modulate them frame-wisely to inject view-dependent features. 3D Gaussian splats and camera pose parameters can then be estimated via different prediction heads. Experiments show that VicaSplat surpasses baseline methods for multi-view inputs, and achieves comparable performance to prior two-view approaches. Remarkably, VicaSplat also demonstrates exceptional cross-dataset generalization capability on the ScanNet benchmark, achieving superior performance without any fine-tuning.

It contains a hierarchical structure, like a tree structure, and context relations among nodes. To equip models with such capabilities, many researchers predefine the parse graph of body structure to design HPE frameworks. However, these frameworks struggle to adapt to instances that deviate from the predefined parse graph and they are often parameter-heavy. Unlike them, we view the feature map holistically, much like the human body. It can be optimized using parse graphs, where nodes' implicit feature representation boosts adaptability, avoiding rigid structural limitations. In this paper, we design the Refinement Module based on the Parse Graph of feature map (RMPG), which includes two stages: top-down decomposition and bottom-up combination. In the first stage, the feature map is constructed into a tree structure through recursive decomposition, with each node representing a sub-feature map, thereby achieving hierarchical modeling of features. In the second stage, context information is calculated and sub-feature maps with context are recursively connected to gradually build a refined feature map. Additionally, we design a hierarchical network with fewer parameters using multiple RMPG modules to model the context relations and hierarchies in the parse graph of body structure for HPE, some of which are supervised to obtain context relations among body parts. Our network achieves excellent results on multiple mainstream human pose datasets and the effectiveness of RMPG is proven on different methods. The code of RMPG will be open.</p></details> |  | None |

Given a text query, RGS determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot's workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation. Recent studies leverage powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visually grounding free-flowing natural language in real-world robotic execution. However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi-CS, featuring hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios: Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi-CS features a lightweight decoder combined with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide open-set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open-vocabulary performance. We validate our approach through real-world RGS experiments using a 7-DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33\% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop scenes.

Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF) signals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the signal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus on single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot generalize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance. Specifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are entangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also intertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific confounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates counterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE trains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how human body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate skeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for generative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences between counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific confounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent representations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new subjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three public datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental results show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces estimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for cross-environment HPE.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector.

Our key innovation lies in constructing vanishing points from line features and proposing a weighted fusion strategy to build Global Primitives in the world coordinate system. This strategy associates multiple frames with non-overlapping regions and formulates a multi-frame reprojection error optimization, significantly improving tracking accuracy in texture-scarce scenarios.

Compared to traditional geometric methods prioritizing texture-affluent features like edges, our keypoint selector employs the learned uncertainty to filter out the low-quality features based on global inconsistency. In contrast to the learning-based algorithms that model the scale-agnostic diagonal weight matrix for covariance, we design a metrics-aware covariance model to capture the spatial error during keypoint registration and the correlations between different axes. Integrating this covariance model into pose graph optimization enhances the robustness and reliability of pose estimation, particularly in challenging environments with varying illumination, feature density, and motion patterns. On public benchmark datasets, MAC-VO outperforms existing VO algorithms and even some SLAM algorithms in challenging environments. The covariance map also provides valuable information about the reliability of the estimated poses, which can benefit decision-making for autonomous systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods always struggle with either low rendering qualities (\eg, visual fidelity and physically plausible HOIs) or high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose HOGS (Human-Object Rendering via 3D Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework for efficient and physically plausible HOI rendering from sparse views. Specifically, HOGS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physics-aware optimization process. It incorporates a Human Pose Refinement module for accurate pose estimation and a Sparse-View Human-Object Contact Prediction module for efficient contact region identification. This combination enables coherent joint rendering of human and object Gaussians while enforcing physically plausible interactions. Extensive experiments on the HODome dataset demonstrate that HOGS achieves superior rendering quality, efficiency, and physical plausibility compared to existing methods.

Commonly used publicly-available AD datasets typically contain large amounts of car and vehicle object instances but a low number of cyclist instances, usually with limited appearance and pose diversity. This cyclist training data scarcity problem not only limits the generalization of deep-learning perception models for cyclist semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and cyclist crossing intention prediction, but also limits research on new cyclist-related tasks such as fine-grained cyclist pose estimation and spatio-temporal analysis under complex interactions between humans and articulated objects. To address this data scarcity problem, in this paper we propose a framework to generate synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist data assets that can be used to generate training data for different tasks. In our framework, we designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that we use to train a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based reconstruction and image rendering method. We then propose a parametric bicycle 3DGS composition model to assemble 8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information from cyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (rider pedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person, while automatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicycles using a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics pose refinement.

Object symmetry complicates the direct mapping of sensory input to object rotation, as the rotation becomes ambiguous and lacks a unique training target. Some proposed solutions involve evaluating multiple pose hypotheses against the input or predicting a probability distribution, but these approaches suffer from significant computational overhead. Here, we show that representing object rotation with a neural population code overcomes these limitations, enabling a direct mapping to rotation and end-to-end learning. As a result, population codes facilitate fast and accurate pose estimation. On the T-LESS dataset, we achieve inference in 3.2 milliseconds on an Apple M1 CPU and a Maximum Symmetry-Aware Surface Distance accuracy of 84.7% using only gray-scale image input, compared to 69.7% accuracy when directly mapping to pose.</p></details> |  | None |

Visual feature matching is crucial to vision-based pipelines but remains particularly challenging in natural outdoor settings due to perceptual aliasing. We address this issue in vineyards, where repetitive vine trunks and other natural elements generate ambiguous descriptors that hinder reliable feature matching. We hypothesise that semantic information tied to keypoint positions can alleviate perceptual aliasing by enhancing keypoint descriptor distinctiveness. To this end, we introduce a keypoint semantic integration technique that improves the descriptors in semantically meaningful regions within the image, enabling more accurate differentiation even among visually similar local features. We validate this approach in two vineyard perception tasks: (i) relative pose estimation and (ii) visual localisation. Across all tested keypoint types and descriptors, our method improves matching accuracy by 12.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness over multiple months in challenging vineyard conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/LCAS/GAIA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/LCAS/GAIA) |

While existing methods predominantly operate on RGB images, we propose a novel network that directly processes raw images, bypassing the need for the Image Signal Processor (ISP). This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations. This work represents the first attempt to develop a keypoint detection and feature description network specifically for raw images, offering a more efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

The proposed method addresses the challenges of aligning aerial and ground data for pose estimation, which is crucial for accurate point-to-point navigation in GPS-degraded environments. By integrating information from both perspectives into a factor graph framework, our approach effectively estimates the robot's global position and orientation. Additionally, we enhance the repeatability of deep-learned keypoints for metric localisation in forests by incorporating a semantically-guided regression loss. This loss encourages greater attention to wooden structures, e.g., tree trunks, which serve as stable and distinguishable features, thereby improving the consistency of keypoints and increasing the success rate of global registration, a process we refer to as re-localisation. The re-localisation module along with the factor-graph structure, populated by odometry and ground-to-aerial factors over time, allows global localisation under dense canopies. We validate the performance of our method through extensive experiments in three forest scenarios, demonstrating its global localisation capability and superiority over alternative state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and robustness in these challenging environments. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve drift-free localisation with bounded positioning errors, ensuring reliable and safe robot navigation through dense forests.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> | None |

However, the world in which we live is dynamic, characterized by numerous interactions between the environment and humans or robotic agents. Static semantic maps are unable to capture this information, and the naive solution of rescanning the environment after every change is both costly and ineffective in tracking e.g. objects being stored away in drawers. With Lost & Found we present an approach that addresses this limitation. Based solely on egocentric recordings with corresponding hand position and camera pose estimates, we are able to track the 6DoF poses of the moving object within the detected interaction interval. These changes are applied online to a transformable scene graph that captures object-level relations. Compared to state-of-the-art object pose trackers, our approach is more reliable in handling the challenging egocentric viewpoint and the lack of depth information. It outperforms the second-best approach by 34% and 56% for translational and orientational error, respectively, and produces visibly smoother 6DoF object trajectories. In addition, we illustrate how the acquired interaction information in the dynamic scene graph can be employed in the context of robotic applications that would otherwise be unfeasible: We show how our method allows to command a mobile manipulator through teach & repeat, and how information about prior interaction allows a mobile manipulator to retrieve an object hidden in a drawer.

Skeleton information was extracted using a pose estimation model, and joint angles were computed based on the extracted joint data. We also apply temporal data augmentation by horizontally flipping video frames to increase the dataset size and improve performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the JAAD and PIE datasets using pose data with the bounding boxes, outperforming the SGNet model.

Such long-sequence in-the-wild motions are highly valuable to applications such as motion generation and motion understanding, but are of great challenge to be recovered due to abrupt shot transitions, partial occlusions, and dynamic backgrounds presented in such videos. Existing methods primarily focus on single-shot videos, where continuity is maintained within a single camera view, or simplify multi-shot alignment in camera space only. In this work, we tackle the challenges by integrating an enhanced camera pose estimation with Human Motion Recovery (HMR) by incorporating a shot transition detector and a robust alignment module for accurate pose and orientation continuity across shots. By leveraging a custom motion integrator, we effectively mitigate the problem of foot sliding and ensure temporal consistency in human pose. Extensive evaluations on our created multi-shot dataset from public 3D human datasets demonstrate the robustness of our method in reconstructing realistic human motion in world coordinates.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project page: https://zhangyuhong01.github.io/HumanMM/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zhangyuhong01.github.io/HumanMM) |

These tasks include face parsing, landmark detection, head pose estimation, attribute prediction, age, gender, and race estimation, facial expression recognition, face recognition, and face visibility. Traditional face analysis approaches rely on task-specific architectures and pre-processing techniques, limiting scalability and integration. In contrast, FaceXFormer employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where each task is represented as a learnable token, enabling seamless multi-task processing within a unified model. To enhance efficiency, we introduce FaceX, a lightweight decoder with a novel bi-directional cross-attention mechanism, which jointly processes face and task tokens to learn robust and generalized facial representations. We train FaceXFormer on ten diverse face perception datasets and evaluate it against both specialized and multi-task models across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance. Additionally, we analyze the impact of various components of FaceXFormer on performance, assess real-world robustness in "in-the-wild" settings, and conduct a computational performance evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, FaceXFormer is the first model capable of handling ten facial analysis tasks while maintaining real-time performance at 33.21 FPS.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of multi-robot cooperative exploration systems. First, we review the evolution of robotic exploration and introduce a modular research framework tailored for multi-robot cooperative exploration. Based on this framework, we systematically categorize and summarize key system components. As a foundational module for multi-robot exploration, the localization and mapping module is primarily introduced by focusing on global and relative pose estimation, as well as multi-robot map merging techniques. The cooperative motion module is further divided into learning-based approaches and multi-stage planning, with the latter encompassing target generation, task allocation, and motion planning strategies. Given the communication constraints of real-world environments, we also analyze the communication module, emphasizing how robots exchange information within local communication ranges and under limited transmission capabilities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions for multi-robot cooperative exploration in light of real-world trends. This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field.</p></details> |  | None |

Zero-shot approaches eliminate the need for training but depend on pre-existing 3D object models, which are often impractical to obtain. To address this, we propose a language-guided few-shot 3D reconstruction method, reconstructing a 3D mesh from few input images. In the proposed pipeline, receives a set of input images and a language query. A combination of GroundingDINO and Segment Anything Model outputs segmented masks from which a sparse point cloud is reconstructed with VGGSfM. Subsequently, the mesh is reconstructed with the Gaussian Splatting method SuGAR. In a final cleaning step, artifacts are removed, resulting in the final 3D mesh of the queried object. We evaluate the method in terms of accuracy and quality of the geometry and texture. Furthermore, we study the impact of imaging conditions such as viewing angle, number of input images, and image overlap on 3D object reconstruction quality, efficiency, and computational scalability.</p></details> | under review | None |
| **[RoboReflect: A Robotic Reflective Reasoning Framework for Grasping Ambiguous-Condition Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09307v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotic technology rapidly develops, robots are being employed in an increasing number of fields. However, due to the complexity of deployment environments or the prevalence of ambiguous-condition objects, the practical application of robotics still faces many challenges, leading to frequent errors. Traditional methods and some LLM-based approaches, although improved, still require substantial human intervention and struggle with autonomous error correction in complex scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboReflect, a novel framework leveraging large vision-language models (LVLMs) to enable self-reflection and autonomous error correction in robotic grasping tasks. RoboReflect allows robots to automatically adjust their strategies based on unsuccessful attempts until successful execution is achieved. The corrected strategies are saved in the memory for future task reference. We evaluate RoboReflect through extensive testing on eight common objects prone to ambiguous conditions of three categories. Our results demonstrate that RoboReflect not only outperforms existing grasp pose estimation methods like AnyGrasp and high-level action planning techniques ReKep with GPT-4V but also significantly enhances the robot's capability to adapt and correct errors independently. These findings underscore the critical importance of autonomous self-reflection in robotic systems while effectively addressing the challenges posed by ambiguous-condition environments.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, this paper introduces a Video Understanding and Reasoning Framework (VURF) based on the reasoning power of LLMs. Ours is a novel approach to extend the utility of LLMs in the context of video tasks, leveraging their capacity to generalize from minimal input and output demonstrations within a contextual framework. We harness their contextual learning capabilities by presenting LLMs with pairs of instructions and their corresponding high-level programs to generate executable visual programs for video understanding. To enhance the program's accuracy and robustness, we implement two important strategies. \emph{Firstly,} we employ a feedback-generation approach, powered by GPT-3.5, to rectify errors in programs utilizing unsupported functions. \emph{Secondly}, taking motivation from recent works on self-refinement of LLM outputs, we introduce an iterative procedure for improving the quality of the in-context examples by aligning the initial outputs to the outputs that would have been generated had the LLM not been bound by the structure of the in-context examples. Our results on several video-specific tasks, including visual QA, video anticipation, pose estimation, and multi-video QA, illustrate these enhancements' efficacy in improving the performance of visual programming approaches for video tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ReynoldsFlow: Exquisite Flow Estimation via Reynolds Transport Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04500v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow is a fundamental technique for motion estimation, widely applied in video stabilization, interpolation, and object tracking. Traditional optical flow estimation methods rely on restrictive assumptions like brightness constancy and slow motion constraints. Recent deep learning-based flow estimations require extensive training on large domain-specific datasets, making them computationally demanding. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) advances have enabled deep learning models to take advantage of optical flow as an important feature for object tracking and motion analysis. Since optical flow is commonly encoded in HSV for visualization, its conversion to RGB for neural network processing is nonlinear and may introduce perceptual distortions. These transformations amplify the sensitivity to estimation errors, potentially affecting the predictive accuracy of the networks. To address these challenges that are influential to the performance of downstream network models, we propose Reynolds flow, a novel training-free flow estimation inspired by the Reynolds transport theorem, offering a principled approach to modeling complex motion dynamics. In addition to conventional HSV-based visualization of Reynolds flow, we also introduce an RGB-encoded representation of Reynolds flow designed to improve flow visualization and feature enhancement for neural networks. We evaluated the effectiveness of Reynolds flow in video-based tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks, tiny object detection on UAVDB, infrared object detection on Anti-UAV, and pose estimation on GolfDB, demonstrate that networks trained with RGB-encoded Reynolds flow achieve SOTA performance, exhibiting improved robustness and efficiency across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  | None |

Robotic pollination has been proposed to supplement natural pollination to ensure global food security due to the decreased population of natural pollinators. However, flower pose estimation for pollination is challenging due to natural variability, flower clusters, and high accuracy demands due to the flowers' fragility when pollinating. This method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate photorealistic synthetic datasets with precise pose annotations, enabling effective knowledge distillation from a high-capacity teacher model to a lightweight student model for efficient inference. The approach was evaluated on both single and multi-arm robotic platforms, achieving a mean pose estimation error of 0.6 cm and 19.14 degrees within a low computational cost.

We reformulate 3D reconstruction as image-to-image translation and introduce the Relative Coordinate Map (RCM), which aligns multiple unposed images to a main view without pose estimation. While RCM simplifies the process, its lack of global 3D supervision can yield noisy outputs. To address this, we propose Relative Coordinate Gaussians (RCG) as an extension to RCM, which treats each pixel's coordinates as a Gaussian center and employs differentiable rasterization for consistent geometry and pose recovery. Our LucidFusion framework handles an arbitrary number of unposed inputs, producing robust 3D reconstructions within seconds and paving the way for more flexible, pose-free 3D pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, [project page](https://heye0507.github.io/LucidFusion_page/)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://heye0507.github.io/LucidFusion_page) |

The input constraints are often not satisfied in real-world setups, making the approach impractical. We show that unsynchronized videos from unknown poses can generate dynamic neural fields as long as the videos capture human motion. Humans are one of the most common dynamic subjects captured in videos, and their shapes and poses can be estimated using state-of-the-art libraries. While noisy, the estimated human shape and pose parameters provide a decent initialization point to start the highly non-convex and under-constrained problem of training a consistent dynamic neural representation. Given the shape and pose parameters of humans in individual frames, we formulate methods to calculate the time offsets between videos, followed by camera pose estimations that analyze the 3D joint positions. Then, we train the dynamic neural fields employing multiresolution grids while we concurrently refine both time offsets and camera poses. The setup still involves optimizing many parameters; therefore, we introduce a robust progressive learning strategy to stabilize the process. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate spatio-temporal calibration and high-quality scene reconstruction in challenging conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing NeRF-based approaches either lack geometric constraints or require extensive storage for feature matching, limiting their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and novel visual localization approach based on the neural implicit map with complementary features. Specifically, to enforce geometric constraints and reduce storage requirements, we implicitly learn a 3D keypoint descriptor field, avoiding the need to explicitly store point-wise features. To further address the semantic ambiguity of descriptors, we introduce additional semantic contextual feature fields, which enhance the quality and reliability of 2D-3D correspondences. Besides, we propose descriptor similarity distribution alignment to minimize the domain gap between 2D and 3D feature spaces during matching. Finally, we construct the matching graph using both complementary descriptors and contextual features to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondences for 6-DoF pose estimation. Compared with the recent NeRF-based approaches, our method achieves a 3$\times$ faster training speed and a 45$\times$ reduction in model storage. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms or is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art NeRF-based visual localization methods.

However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Toward this goal, this paper presents ReJSHand (which stands for Refined Joint and Skeleton Features), a cutting-edge network formulated for real-time hand pose estimation and mesh reconstruction. The proposed framework is designed to accurately predict 3D hand gestures under real-time constraints, which is essential for systems that demand agile and responsive hand motion tracking. The network's design prioritizes computational efficiency without compromising accuracy, a prerequisite for instantaneous robotic interactions. Specifically, ReJSHand comprises a 2D keypoint generator, a 3D keypoint generator, an expansion block, and a feature interaction block for meticulously reconstructing 3D hand poses from 2D imagery. In addition, the multi-head self-attention mechanism and a coordinate attention layer enhance feature representation, streamlining the creation of hand mesh vertices through sophisticated feature mapping and linear transformation.

| **[Differentiable Rendering-based Pose Estimation for Surgical Robotic Instruments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05953v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot pose estimation is a challenging and crucial task for vision-based surgical robotic automation. Typical robotic calibration approaches, however, are not applicable to surgical robots, such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), due to joint angle measurement errors from cable-drives and the partially visible kinematic chain. Hence, previous works in surgical robotic automation used tracking algorithms to estimate the pose of the surgical tool in real-time and compensate for the joint angle errors. However, a big limitation of these previous tracking works is the initialization step which relied on only keypoints and SolvePnP. In this work, we fully explore the potential of geometric primitives beyond just keypoints with differentiable rendering, cylinders, and construct a versatile pose matching pipeline in a novel pose hypothesis space. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our single-shot calibration method with both calibration consistency and real surgical tasks. As a result, this marker-less calibration approach proves to be a robust and generalizable initialization step for surgical tool tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in the camera coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative camera-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting.

However, current Transformer-based methods for video pose estimation often face challenges in managing redundant temporal information and achieving fine-grained perception because they only focus on processing low-resolution features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale resolution framework that encodes spatio-temporal representations at varying granularities and executes fine-grained perception compensation. Furthermore, we employ a density peaks clustering method to dynamically identify and prioritize tokens that offer important semantic information. This strategy effectively prunes redundant feature tokens, especially those arising from multi-frame features, thereby optimizing computational efficiency without sacrificing semantic richness. Empirically, it sets new benchmarks for both performance and efficiency on three large-scale datasets. Our method achieves a 93.8% improvement in inference speed compared to the baseline, while also enhancing pose estimation accuracy, reaching 87.4 mAP on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently introduced Gaussian Splats efficiently model object geometry, but lack persistent state estimation for task-oriented manipulation. We present Persistent Object Gaussian Splat (POGS), a system that embeds semantics, self-supervised visual features, and object grouping features into a compact representation that can be continuously updated to estimate the pose of scanned objects. POGS updates object states without requiring expensive rescanning or prior CAD models of objects. After an initial multi-view scene capture and training phase, POGS uses a single stereo camera to integrate depth estimates along with self-supervised vision encoder features for object pose estimation. POGS supports grasping, reorientation, and natural language-driven manipulation by refining object pose estimates, facilitating sequential object reset operations with human-induced object perturbations and tool servoing, where robots recover tool pose despite tool perturbations of up to 30{\deg}. POGS achieves up to 12 consecutive successful object resets and recovers from 80% of in-grasp tool perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing single RGB-based methods often compromise accuracy due to their reliance on initial pose estimates and susceptibility to rotational ambiguity, while approaches requiring depth sensors or multi-view setups incur significant deployment costs. To address these limitations, we introduce SplatPose, a novel framework that synergizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a dual-branch neural architecture to achieve high-precision pose estimation using only a single RGB image. Central to our approach is the Dual-Attention Ray Scoring Network (DARS-Net), which innovatively decouples positional and angular alignment through geometry-domain attention mechanisms, explicitly modeling directional dependencies to mitigate rotational ambiguity. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine optimization pipeline progressively refines pose estimates by aligning dense 2D features between query images and 3DGS-synthesized views, effectively correcting feature misalignment and depth errors from sparse ray sampling. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SplatPose achieves state-of-the-art 6-DoF pose estimation accuracy in single RGB settings, rivaling approaches that depend on depth or multi-view images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[GaussianCAD: Robust Self-Supervised CAD Reconstruction from Three Orthographic Views Using 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05161v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic reconstruction of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models from CAD sketches has recently gained significant attention in the computer vision community. Most existing methods, however, rely on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth for supervision, which are often difficult to be obtained in industrial applications and are sensitive to noise inputs. We propose viewing CAD reconstruction as a specific instance of sparse-view 3D reconstruction to overcome these limitations. While this reformulation offers a promising perspective, existing 3D reconstruction methods typically require natural images and corresponding camera poses as inputs, which introduces two major significant challenges: (1) modality discrepancy between CAD sketches and natural images, and (2) difficulty of accurate camera pose estimation for CAD sketches. To solve these issues, we first transform the CAD sketches into representations resembling natural images and extract corresponding masks. Next, we manually calculate the camera poses for the orthographic views to ensure accurate alignment within the 3D coordinate system. Finally, we employ a customized sparse-view 3D reconstruction method to achieve high-quality reconstructions from aligned orthographic views. By leveraging raster CAD sketches for self-supervision, our approach eliminates the reliance on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth. Experiments on the Sub-Fusion360 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches in CAD reconstruction performance and exhibits strong robustness to noisy inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

Precise pose estimation is an important task for mobile robots exploring planetary surfaces, as they operate in GPS-denied environments. Although visual odometry provides accurate localization, it is computationally expensive and can fail in dim or high-contrast lighting. Wheel encoders can also provide odometry estimation, but are prone to slipping on the sandy terrain encountered on Mars. Although traditionally a scientific surveying sensor, GPR has been used on Earth for terrain classification and localization through subsurface feature matching. The Perseverance rover and the upcoming ExoMars rover have GPR sensors already equipped to aid in the search of water and mineral resources. We propose to leverage GPR to aid in Mars rover localization. Specifically, we develop a novel GPR-based deep learning model that predicts 1D relative pose translation. We fuse our GPR pose prediction method with inertial and wheel encoder data in a filtering framework to output rover localization. We perform experiments in a Mars analog environment and demonstrate that our GPR-based displacement predictions both outperform wheel encoders and improve multi-modal filtering estimates in high-slip environments. Lastly, we present the first dataset aimed at GPR-based localization in Mars analog environments, which will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite their large numbers and physical differences, their dance performances exhibit unparalleled unity in the K-pop industry. According to one theory, their dance synchronization rate is said to be 90% or even 97%. However, there is little concrete data to substantiate this synchronization rate. In this study, we analyzed SEVENTEEN's dance performances using videos available on YouTube. We applied 2D skeleton detection and 3D pose estimation to evaluate joint angles, body part movements, and jumping and crouching motions to investigate the factors contributing to their performance unity. The analysis revealed exceptionally high consistency in the movement direction of body parts, as well as in the ankle and head positions during jumping movements and the head position during crouching movements. These findings suggested that SEVENTEEN's high synchronization rate can be attributed to the consistency of movement direction and the synchronization of ankle and head heights during jumping and crouching movements.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures and 20 tables</p></details> | None |

In reinforcement learning (RL), one popular approach has been to use massively-parallelized, domain-randomized simulations to learn a policy offline over a vast array of contact conditions, allowing robust sim-to-real transfer. Inspired by recent advances in real-time parallel simulation, this work considers instead the viability of online planning methods for contact-rich manipulation by studying the well-known in-hand cube reorientation task.

| **[Active 6D Pose Estimation for Textureless Objects using Multi-View RGB Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03726v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of textureless objects from RBG images is an important problem in robotics. Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and severe occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to handle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose estimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for estimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our approach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a sequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency. First, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth ambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify the subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through canonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then introduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera viewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty and enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset as well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated using the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging our next-best-view strategy, our method achieves high object pose accuracy with substantially fewer viewpoints than heuristic-based policies.</p></details> |  | None |

It faces a significant challenge in achieving precise autonomous docking at ports or stations, still relying on remote human control or external positioning systems for accuracy and safety which limits the full potential of human-out-of-loop deployment for USVs.This paper introduces a novel supervised learning pipeline with the auto-labeling technique for USVs autonomous visual docking. Firstly, we designed an auto-labeling data collection pipeline that appends relative pose and image pair to the dataset. This step does not require conventional manual labeling for supervised learning. Secondly, the Neural Dock Pose Estimator (NDPE) is proposed to achieve relative dock pose prediction without the need for hand-crafted feature engineering, camera calibration, and peripheral markers. Moreover, The NDPE can accurately predict the relative dock pose in real-world water environments, facilitating the implementation of Position-Based Visual Servo (PBVS) and low-level motion controllers for efficient and autonomous docking.Experiments show that the NDPE is robust to the disturbance of the distance and the USV velocity. The effectiveness of our proposed solution is tested and validated in real-world water environments, reflecting its capability to handle real-world autonomous docking tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches either require time-consuming offline processing with a complete map, or rely on expensive sensors and substantial computational resources. To address the problems, we propose Floorplan-SLAM, which incorporates floorplan reconstruction tightly into a multi-session SLAM system by seamlessly interacting with plane extraction, pose estimation, and back-end optimization, achieving real-time, high-accuracy, and long-term floorplan reconstruction using only a stereo camera. Specifically, we present a robust plane extraction algorithm that operates in a compact plane parameter space and leverages spatially complementary features to accurately detect planar structures, even in weakly textured scenes. Furthermore, we propose a floorplan reconstruction module tightly coupled with the SLAM system, which uses continuously optimized plane landmarks and poses to formulate and solve a novel optimization problem, thereby enabling real-time incremental floorplan reconstruction. Note that by leveraging the map merging capability of multi-session SLAM, our method supports long-term floorplan reconstruction across multiple sessions without redundant data collection. Experiments on the VECtor and the self-collected datasets indicate that Floorplan-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of plane extraction robustness, pose estimation accuracy, and floorplan reconstruction fidelity and speed, achieving real-time performance at 25-45 FPS without GPU acceleration, which reduces the floorplan reconstruction time for a 1000 square meters scene from over 10 hours to just 9.44 minutes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Category-level Meta-learned NeRF Priors for Efficient Object Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01582v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 3D object mapping, category-level priors enable efficient object reconstruction and canonical pose estimation, requiring only a single prior per semantic category (e.g., chair, book, laptop). Recently, DeepSDF has predominantly been used as a category-level shape prior, but it struggles to reconstruct sharp geometry and is computationally expensive. In contrast, NeRFs capture fine details but have yet to be effectively integrated with category-level priors in a real-time multi-object mapping framework. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRENOM, a Prior-based Efficient Neural Object Mapper that integrates category-level priors with object-level NeRFs to enhance reconstruction efficiency while enabling canonical object pose estimation. PRENOM gets to know objects on a first-name basis by meta-learning on synthetic reconstruction tasks generated from open-source shape datasets. To account for object category variations, it employs a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the NeRF architecture for each category, balancing reconstruction quality and training time. Additionally, prior-based probabilistic ray sampling directs sampling toward expected object regions, accelerating convergence and improving reconstruction quality under constrained resources. Experimental results on a low-end GPU highlight the ability of PRENOM to achieve high-quality reconstructions while maintaining computational feasibility. Specifically, comparisons with prior-free NeRF-based approaches on a synthetic dataset show a 21% lower Chamfer distance, demonstrating better reconstruction quality. Furthermore, evaluations against other approaches using shape priors on a noisy real-world dataset indicate a 13% improvement averaged across all reconstruction metrics, and comparable pose and size estimation accuracy, while being trained for 5x less time.</p></details> |  | None |

LiDAR is a widely used sensor for pose estimation, with odometry and localization being two primary tasks. LiDAR odometry estimates the relative motion between consecutive scans, while LiDAR localization aligns real-time scans with a pre-recorded map to obtain a global pose. Although they have different objectives and application scenarios, both rely on point cloud registration as the underlying technique and face shared challenges of data corruption caused by adverse conditions (e.g., rain). While state-of-the-art (SOTA) pose estimation systems achieved high accuracy on clean data, their robustness to corrupted data remains unclear. In this work, we propose a framework to systematically evaluate five SOTA LiDAR pose estimation systems across 18 synthetic real-world point cloud corruptions. Our experiments reveal that odometry systems degrade significantly under specific corruptions, with relative position errors increasing from 0.5% to more than 80%, while localization systems remain highly robust. We further demonstrate that denoising techniques can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of noise-induced corruptions, and re-training learning-based systems with corrupted data significantly enhances the robustness against various corruption types.</p></details> |  | None |

To estimate the 3D human position from a 2D image, existing methods either depend on the geometric assumption of a fixed camera or use a position regression model trained on datasets containing little camera ego-motion. These methods are vulnerable to fierce camera ego-motion, resulting in inaccurate person localization. We consider person localization as a part of a pose estimation problem. By representing a human with a four-point model, our method jointly estimates the 2D camera attitude and the person's 3D location through optimization. Evaluations on both public datasets and real robot experiments demonstrate our method outperforms baselines in person localization accuracy. Our method is further implemented into a person-following system and deployed on an agile quadruped robot.</p></details> | Under review | None |

However, developing a robust and consistent state estimator remains a significant challenge, as the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) struggles to handle the model nonlinearity, especially for inertial measurement unit (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). To provide a consistent and efficient solution of pose estimation, we propose Eq-LIO, a robust state estimator for tightly coupled LIO systems based on an equivariant filter (EqF). Compared with the invariant Kalman filter based on the $\SE_2(3)$ group structure, the EqF uses the symmetry of the semi-direct product group to couple the system state including IMU bias, navigation state and LiDAR extrinsic calibration state, thereby suppressing linearization error and improving the behavior of the estimator in the event of unexpected state changes.

However, models trained solely on single-task objectives or generic datasets often lack the contextual information needed for robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified encoder trained on multiple computer vision tasks crucial for urban driving, including depth, pose, and 3D scene flow estimation, as well as semantic, instance, panoptic, and motion segmentation. By integrating these diverse visual cues-similar to human perceptual mechanisms-the encoder captures rich features that enhance navigation-related predictions. We evaluate the model on steering estimation as a downstream task, leveraging its dense latent space. To ensure efficient multi-task learning, we introduce a multi-scale feature network for pose estimation and apply knowledge distillation from a multi-backbone teacher model. Our findings highlight two key findings: (1) the unified encoder achieves competitive performance across all visual perception tasks, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities; and (2) for steering estimation, the frozen unified encoder-leveraging dense latent representations-outperforms both its fine-tuned counterpart and the same frozen model pretrained on generic datasets like ImageNet. These results underline the significance of task-specific visual features and demonstrate the promise of multi-task learning in advancing autonomous driving systems.

Cross-view pose optimization offers an effective solution by directly estimating vehicle pose using satellite-view images. However, existing methods primarily rely on cross-view features at a given pose, neglecting fine-grained contexts for precision and global contexts for robustness against large initial pose errors. To overcome these limitations, we propose PIDLoc, a novel cross-view pose optimization approach inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Using RGB images and LiDAR, the PIDLoc comprises the PID branches to model cross-view feature relationships and the spatially aware pose estimator (SPE) to estimate the pose from these relationships. The PID branches leverage feature differences for local context (P), aggregated feature differences for global context (I), and gradients of feature differences for precise pose adjustment (D) to enhance localization accuracy under large initial pose errors. Integrated with the PID branches, the SPE captures spatial relationships within the PID-branch features for consistent localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the PIDLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-view pose estimation for the KITTI dataset, reducing position error by $37.8\%$ compared with the previous state-of-the-art.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR-25 | None |

| **[Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real Visual Quadrotor Control with Hard Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02198v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first framework demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of visual control policies learned in a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) environment for quadrotors to fly through racing gates. Robust transfer from simulation to real flight poses a major challenge, as standard simulators often lack sufficient visual fidelity. To address this, we construct a photorealistic simulation environment of quadrotor racing tracks, called FalconGym, which provides effectively unlimited synthetic images for training. Within FalconGym, we develop a pipelined approach for crossing gates that combines (i) a Neural Pose Estimator (NPE) coupled with a Kalman filter to reliably infer quadrotor poses from single-frame RGB images and IMU data, and (ii) a self-attention-based multi-modal controller that adaptively integrates visual features and pose estimation. This multi-modal design compensates for perception noise and intermittent gate visibility. We train this controller purely in FalconGym with imitation learning and deploy the resulting policy to real hardware with no additional fine-tuning. Simulation experiments on three distinct tracks (circle, U-turn and figure-8) demonstrate that our controller outperforms a vision-only state-of-the-art baseline in both success rate and gate-crossing accuracy. In 30 live hardware flights spanning three tracks and 120 gates, our controller achieves a 95.8% success rate and an average error of just 10 cm when flying through 38 cm-radius gates.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Constraint-Based Modeling of Dynamic Entities in 3D Scene Graphs for Robust SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02050v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots depend crucially on their ability to perceive and process information from dynamic, ever-changing environments. Traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches struggle to maintain consistent scene representations because of numerous moving objects, often treating dynamic elements as outliers rather than explicitly modeling them in the scene representation. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical 3D scene graph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and estimating the pose of dynamic objects and agents. We use fiducial markers to detect dynamic entities and to extract their attributes while improving keyframe selection and implementing new capabilities for dynamic entity mapping. We maintain a hierarchical representation where dynamic objects are registered in the SLAM graph and are constrained with robot keyframes and the floor level of the building with our novel entity-keyframe constraints and intra-entity constraints. By combining semantic and geometric constraints between dynamic entities and the environment, our system jointly optimizes the SLAM graph to estimate the pose of the robot and various dynamic agents and objects while maintaining an accurate map. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves a 27.57% reduction in pose estimation error compared to traditional methods and enables higher-level reasoning about scene dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

However, they introduce uncertainties in hand-object interactions due to their inherent compliance and lack of precise finger proprioception as in rigid hands. These limitations become particularly significant when performing contact-rich tasks like insertion. To address these challenges, additional sensing modalities are required to enable robust insertion capabilities. This letter explores the essential sensing requirements for successful insertion tasks with compliant hands, focusing on the role of visuotactile perception (i.e., visual and tactile perception). We propose a simulation-based multimodal policy learning framework that leverages all-around tactile sensing and an extrinsic depth camera. A transformer-based policy, trained through a teacher-student distillation process, is successfully transferred to a real-world robotic system without further training. Our results emphasize the crucial role of tactile sensing in conjunction with visual perception for accurate object-socket pose estimation, successful sim-to-real transfer and robust task execution.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose RUSSO, a robust underwater SLAM system which fuses stereo camera, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and imaging sonar to achieve robust and accurate localization in challenging underwater environments for 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) estimation. During visual degradation, the system is reduced to a sonar-inertial system estimating 3-DoF poses. The sonar pose estimation serves as a strong prior for IMU propagation, thereby enhancing the reliability of pose estimation with IMU propagation. Additionally, we propose a SLAM initialization method that leverages the imaging sonar to counteract the lack of visual features during the initialization stage of SLAM. We extensively validate RUSSO through experiments in simulator, pool, and sea scenarios. The results demonstrate that RUSSO achieves better robustness and localization accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, especially in visually challenging scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time fusing stereo camera, IMU, and imaging sonar to realize robust underwater SLAM against visual degradation.</p></details> |  | None |

Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce HiBug2, an automated framework for error slice discovery and model repair. HiBug2 first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, HiBug2 extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that HiBug2 not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditionally, these methods solve unconstrained least squares problems using algorithms such as Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt. However, extending factor graphs with native support for equality constraints can improve solution accuracy and broaden their applicability, particularly in optimal control. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of factor graphs that seamlessly incorporates equality constraints without requiring additional optimization algorithms. Our approach maintains the efficiency and flexibility of existing second-order optimization techniques while ensuring constraint feasibility. To validate our method, we apply it to an optimal control problem for velocity tracking in autonomous vehicles and benchmark our results against state-of-the-art constraint handling techniques. Additionally, we introduce ecg2o, a header-only C++ library that extends the widely used g2o factor graph library by adding full support for equality-constrained optimization.

To tackle this challenge, we introduce ADUGS-VINS, which integrates an enhanced SORT algorithm along with a promptable foundation model into VIO, thereby improving pose estimation accuracy in environments with diverse dynamic objects and frequent occlusions. We evaluated our proposed method using multiple public datasets representing various scenes, as well as in a real-world scenario involving diverse dynamic objects. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs impressively in multiple scenarios, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. This highlights its remarkable generalization and adaptability in diverse dynamic environments, showcasing its potential to handle various dynamic objects in practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a compound approach for end-to-end discriminative deep feature learning for person Re-Id based on both body and hand images. We carefully design the Local-Aware Global Attention Network (LAGA-Net), a multi-branch deep network architecture consisting of one branch for spatial attention, one branch for channel attention, one branch for global feature representations and another branch for local feature representations. The attention branches focus on the relevant features of the image while suppressing the irrelevant backgrounds. In order to overcome the weakness of the attention mechanisms, equivariant to pixel shuffling, we integrate relative positional encodings into the spatial attention module to capture the spatial positions of pixels. The global branch intends to preserve the global context or structural information. For the the local branch, which intends to capture the fine-grained information, we perform uniform partitioning to generate stripes on the conv-layer horizontally. We retrieve the parts by conducting a soft partition without explicitly partitioning the images or requiring external cues such as pose estimation. A set of ablation study shows that each component contributes to the increased performance of the LAGA-Net. Extensive evaluations on four popular body-based person Re-Id benchmarks and two publicly available hand datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2108.02234</p></details> | None |

This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GS-CPR obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GS-CPR enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization methods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual localization benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor datasets.

Unlike existing approaches that significantly limit practicality by employing intrusive chirp signals within the audible range, our method utilizes natural music that causes minimal discomfort to humans. Estimating human poses from standard music presents significant challenges. In contrast to sound sources specifically designed for measurement, regular music varies in both volume and pitch. These dynamic changes in signals caused by music are inevitably mixed with alterations in the sound field resulting from human motion, making it hard to extract reliable cues for pose estimation. To address these challenges, BGM2Pose introduces a Contrastive Pose Extraction Module that employs contrastive learning and hard negative sampling to eliminate musical components from the recorded data, isolating the pose information. Additionally, we propose a Frequency-wise Attention Module that enables the model to focus on subtle acoustic variations attributable to human movement by dynamically computing attention across frequency bands. Experiments suggest that our method outperforms the existing methods, demonstrating substantial potential for real-world applications.

However, they often fail to capture the level of detail required for inspection and scene awareness tasks. Conversely, dense SLAM approaches generate richer scene reconstructions but impose a prohibitive computational load to create 3D maps. We present a novel distributed volumetric mapping framework designated as CRADMap that addresses these issues by extending the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ORBSLAM3 [1] system with the COVINS [2] on the backend for global optimization. Our pipeline for volumetric reconstruction fuses dense keyframes at a centralized server via 5G connectivity, aggregating geometry, and occupancy information from multiple autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) without overtaxing onboard resources. This enables each AMR to independently perform mapping while the backend constructs high-fidelity 3D maps in real time. To overcome the limitation of standard visual nodes we automate a 4D mmWave radar, standalone from CRADMap, to test its capabilities for making extra maps of the hidden metallic object(s) in a cluttered environment. Experimental results Section-IV confirm that our framework yields globally consistent volumetric reconstructions and seamlessly supports applied distributed mapping in complex indoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, IEEE</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we introduce an intelligent robotic automation system designed to address this issue. By employing a patented technique that temporarily stiffens garments, we eliminate the traditional necessity for fabric modeling. Our methodological approach is rooted in a meticulously designed three-stage pipeline: first, an accurate pose estimation of the cut fabric pieces; second, a procedure to temporarily join fabric pieces; and third, a closed-loop visual servoing technique for the sewing process. Demonstrating versatility across various fabric types, our approach has been successfully validated in practical settings, notably with cotton material at the Bluewater Defense production line and denim material at Levi's research facility. The techniques described in this paper integrate robotic mechanisms with traditional sewing machines, devising a real-time sewing algorithm, and providing hands-on validation through a collaborative robot setup.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving a good balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness remains a challenge. For instance, CNNs are computationally efficient but struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs excel in capturing such dependencies but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper proposes two ViT-based models for accurate, efficient, and robust 2D pose estimation. The first one, EViTPose, operates in a computationally efficient manner without sacrificing accuracy by utilizing learnable joint tokens to select and process a subset of the most important body patches, enabling us to control the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency by changing the number of patches to be processed. The second one, UniTransPose, while not allowing for the same level of direct control over the trade-off, efficiently handles multiple scales by combining (1) an efficient multi-scale transformer encoder that uses both local and global attention with (2) an efficient sub-pixel CNN decoder for better speed and accuracy. Moreover, by incorporating all joints from different benchmarks into a unified skeletal representation, we train robust methods that learn from multiple datasets simultaneously and perform well across a range of scenarios -- including pose variations, lighting conditions, and occlusions. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods while improving computational efficiency. EViTPose exhibits a significant decrease in computational complexity (30% to 44% less in GFLOPs) with a minimal drop of accuracy (0% to 3.5% less), and UniTransPose achieves accuracy improvements ranging from 0.9% to 43.8% across these benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we explore their potential for localization within pre-existing LiDAR maps, a critical task for applications that require precise navigation and mobile manipulation. Our framework follows a paradigm based on the refinement of an initial pose. Specifically, we first project LiDAR points into 2D space based on a rough initial pose to obtain depth maps, and then employ an optical flow estimation network to align events with LiDAR points in 2D space, followed by camera pose estimation using a PnP solver. To enhance geometric consistency between these two inherently different modalities, we develop a novel frame-based event representation that improves structural clarity. Additionally, given the varying degrees of bias observed in the ground truth poses, we design a module that predicts an auxiliary variable as a regularization term to mitigate the impact of this bias on network convergence. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Traditional GNSS-based localization methods suffer from signal occlusion and multipath effects in urban environments. Meanwhile, methods relying on high-definition (HD) maps are constrained by the high costs associated with the construction and maintenance of HD maps. Standard-definition (SD) maps-based methods, on the other hand, often exhibit unsatisfactory performance or poor generalization ability due to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose SegLocNet, a multimodal GNSS-free localization network that achieves precise localization using bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation. SegLocNet employs a BEV segmentation network to generate semantic maps from multiple sensor inputs, followed by an exhaustive matching process to estimate the vehicle's ego pose. This approach avoids the limitations of regression-based pose estimation and maintains high interpretability and generalization. By introducing a unified map representation, our method can be applied to both HD and SD maps without any modifications to the network architecture, thereby balancing localization accuracy and area coverage. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and that our method can accurately estimate the ego pose in urban environments without relying on GNSS, while maintaining strong generalization ability.

In this study, we propose a Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for person identification using upper body keypoints visible during online conversations, which we term conversational keypoints. Our framework processes both spatial relationships between keypoints and their temporal evolution through two specialized branches: a Spatial Transformer (STR) that learns distinctive structural patterns in keypoint configurations, and a Temporal Transformer (TTR) that captures sequential motion patterns. Using the state-of-the-art Sapiens pose estimator, we extract 133 keypoints (based on COCO-WholeBody format) representing facial features, head pose, and hand positions. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 114 individuals engaged in natural conversations, achieving recognition accuracies of 80.12% for the spatial stream, 63.61% for the temporal stream. We then explored two fusion strategies: a shared loss function approach achieving 82.22% accuracy, and a feature-level fusion method that concatenates feature maps from both streams, significantly improving performance to 94.86%. By jointly modeling both static anatomical relationships and dynamic movement patterns, our approach learns comprehensive identity signatures that are more robust to spoofing than traditional appearance-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving real-time SLAM on mobile robotic systems with limited computational resources is challenging because the complexity of SLAM algorithms increases over time. This restriction can be lifted by offloading computations to edge servers, forming the emerging paradigm of edge-assisted SLAM. Nevertheless, the exogenous and stochastic input processes affect the dynamics of the edge-assisted SLAM system. Moreover, the requirements of clients on SLAM metrics change over time, exerting implicit and time-varying effects on the system. In this paper, we aim to push the limit beyond existing edge-assist SLAM by proposing a new architecture that can handle the input-driven processes and also satisfy clients' implicit and time-varying requirements. The key innovations of our work involve a regional feature prediction method for importance-aware local data processing, a configuration adaptation policy that integrates data compression/decompression and task offloading, and an input-dependent learning framework for task scheduling with constraint satisfaction. Extensive experiments prove that our architecture improves pose estimation accuracy and saves up to 47% of communication costs compared with a popular edge-assisted SLAM system, as well as effectively satisfies the clients' requirements.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their inherent fragility and vulnerability to various threats render them susceptible to significant damage and destruction. The application of advanced 3D reconstruction technologies for high-quality modeling is crucial for preserving them. These technologies help scientists to accurately document and monitor the state of coral reefs, including their structure, species distribution and changes over time. Photogrammetry-based approaches stand out among existing solutions, especially with recent advancements in underwater videography, photogrammetric computer vision, and machine learning. Despite continuous progress in image-based 3D reconstruction techniques, there remains a lack of systematic reviews and comprehensive evaluations of cutting-edge solutions specifically applied to underwater coral reef images. The emerging advanced methods may have difficulty coping with underwater imaging environments, complex coral structures, and computational resource constraints. They need to be reviewed and evaluated to bridge the gap between many cutting-edge technical studies and practical applications. This paper focuses on the two critical stages of these approaches: camera pose estimation and dense surface reconstruction. We systematically review and summarize classical and emerging methods, conducting comprehensive evaluations through real-world and simulated datasets. Based on our findings, we offer reference recommendations and discuss the development potential and challenges of existing approaches in depth.

However, MVO systems face the common issue of lacking inherent scale information from monocular cameras. Traditional methods have good interpretability but can only obtain relative scale and suffer from severe scale drift in long-distance tasks. Learning-based methods under perspective view leverage large amounts of training data to acquire prior knowledge and estimate absolute scale by predicting depth values. However, their generalization ability is limited due to the need to accurately estimate the depth of each point. In contrast, we propose a novel MVO system called BEV-DWPVO. Our approach leverages the common assumption of a ground plane, using Bird's-Eye View (BEV) feature maps to represent the environment in a grid-based structure with a unified scale. This enables us to reduce the complexity of pose estimation from 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) to 3-DoF. Keypoints are extracted and matched within the BEV space, followed by pose estimation through a differentiable weighted Procrustes solver. The entire system is fully differentiable, supporting end-to-end training with only pose supervision and no auxiliary tasks. We validate BEV-DWPVO on the challenging long-sequence datasets NCLT, Oxford, and KITTI, achieving superior results over existing MVO methods on most evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[QORT-Former: Query-optimized Real-time Transformer for Understanding Two Hands Manipulating Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19769v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant advancements have been achieved in the realm of understanding poses and interactions of two hands manipulating an object. The emergence of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies has heightened the demand for real-time performance in these applications. However, current state-of-the-art models often exhibit promising results at the expense of substantial computational overhead. In this paper, we present a query-optimized real-time Transformer (QORT-Former), the first Transformer-based real-time framework for 3D pose estimation of two hands and an object. We first limit the number of queries and decoders to meet the efficiency requirement. Given limited number of queries and decoders, we propose to optimize queries which are taken as input to the Transformer decoder, to secure better accuracy: (1) we propose to divide queries into three types (a left hand query, a right hand query and an object query) and enhance query features (2) by using the contact information between hands and an object and (3) by using three-step update of enhanced image and query features with respect to one another. With proposed methods, we achieved real-time pose estimation performance using just 108 queries and 1 decoder (53.5 FPS on an RTX 3090TI GPU). Surpassing state-of-the-art results on the H2O dataset by 17.6% (left hand), 22.8% (right hand), and 27.2% (object), as well as on the FPHA dataset by 5.3% (right hand) and 10.4% (object), our method excels in accuracy. Additionally, it sets the state-of-the-art in interaction recognition, maintaining real-time efficiency with an off-the-shelf action recognition module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Accurate Pose Estimation for Flight Platforms based on Divergent Multi-Aperture Imaging System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19708v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based pose estimation plays a crucial role in the autonomous navigation of flight platforms. However, the field of view and spatial resolution of the camera limit pose estimation accuracy. This paper designs a divergent multi-aperture imaging system (DMAIS), equivalent to a single imaging system to achieve simultaneous observation of a large field of view and high spatial resolution. The DMAIS overcomes traditional observation limitations, allowing accurate pose estimation for the flight platform. {Before conducting pose estimation, the DMAIS must be calibrated. To this end we propose a calibration method for DMAIS based on the 3D calibration field.} The calibration process determines the imaging parameters of the DMAIS, which allows us to model DMAIS as a generalized camera. Subsequently, a new algorithm for accurately determining the pose of flight platform is introduced. We transform the absolute pose estimation problem into a nonlinear minimization problem. New optimality conditions are established for solving this problem based on Lagrange multipliers. Finally, real calibration experiments show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. Results from real flight experiments validate the system's ability to achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy and arc-minute-level orientation accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Correspondence-Free Pose Estimation with Patterns: A Unified Approach for Multi-Dimensional Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00051v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D pose estimation is a central problem in robot vision. Compared with pose estimation based on point correspondences or its robust versions, correspondence-free methods are often more flexible. However, existing correspondence-free methods often rely on feature representation alignment or end-to-end regression. For such a purpose, a new correspondence-free pose estimation method and its practical algorithms are proposed, whose key idea is the elimination of unknowns by process of addition to separate the pose estimation from correspondence. By taking the considered point sets as patterns, feature functions used to describe these patterns are introduced to establish a sufficient number of equations for optimization. The proposed method is applicable to nonlinear transformations such as perspective projection and can cover various pose estimations from 3D-to-3D points, 3D-to-2D points, and 2D-to-2D points. Experimental results on both simulation and actual data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Increasing the Task Flexibility of Heavy-Duty Manipulators Using Visual 6D Pose Estimation of Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19169v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual 6D pose estimation of objects using deep neural networks have enabled novel ways of vision-based control for heavy-duty robotic applications. In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[STGFormer: Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer for 3D Human Pose Estimation in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10099v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current methods of video-based 3D human pose estimation have achieved significant progress.However, they still face pressing challenges, such as the underutilization of spatiotemporal bodystructure features in transformers and the inadequate granularity of spatiotemporal interaction modeling in graph convolutional networks, which leads to pervasive depth ambiguity in monocular 3D human pose estimation. To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pose Magic: Efficient and Temporally Consistent Human Pose Estimation with a Hybrid Mamba-GCN Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02922v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) are primarily based on Transformers. However, existing Transformer-based 3D HPE backbones often encounter a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. To resolve the above dilemma, in this work, we leverage recent advances in state space models and utilize Mamba for high-quality and efficient long-range modeling. Nonetheless, Mamba still faces challenges in precisely exploiting local dependencies between joints. To address these issues, we propose a new attention-free hybrid spatiotemporal architecture named Hybrid Mamba-GCN (Pose Magic). This architecture introduces local enhancement with GCN by capturing relationships between neighboring joints, thus producing new representations to complement Mamba's outputs. By adaptively fusing representations from Mamba and GCN, Pose Magic demonstrates superior capability in learning the underlying 3D structure. To meet the requirements of real-time inference, we also provide a fully causal version. Extensive experiments show that Pose Magic achieves new SOTA results ($\downarrow 0.9 mm$) while saving $74.1\%$ FLOPs. In addition, Pose Magic exhibits optimal motion consistency and the ability to generalize to unseen sequence lengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

We argue that the increasing miniaturization of optical sensors will lead to the prolific integration of cameras into many more body-worn devices at various locations. This will bring fresh perspectives to established tasks in computer vision and benefit key areas such as human motion tracking, body pose estimation, or action recognition -- particularly for the lower body, which is typically occluded. In this paper, we introduce EgoSim, a novel simulator of body-worn cameras that generates realistic egocentric renderings from multiple perspectives across a wearer's body. A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion capture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with arm- or leg-worn cameras. In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of egocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D poses during several activities: 119 hours of data are derived from AMASS motion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment with 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro cameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit. We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D pose estimation network. Analyzing its domain gap, we show that our dataset and simulator substantially aid training for inference on real-world data.

| **[Learning Structure-Supporting Dependencies via Keypoint Interactive Transformer for General Mammal Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18214v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General mammal pose estimation is an important and challenging task in computer vision, which is essential for understanding mammal behaviour in real-world applications. However, existing studies are at their preliminary research stage, which focus on addressing the problem for only a few specific mammal species. In principle, from specific to general mammal pose estimation, the biggest issue is how to address the huge appearance and pose variances for different species. We argue that given appearance context, instance-level prior and the structural relation among keypoints can serve as complementary evidence. To this end, we propose a Keypoint Interactive Transformer (KIT) to learn instance-level structure-supporting dependencies for general mammal pose estimation. Specifically, our KITPose consists of two coupled components. The first component is to extract keypoint features and generate body part prompts. The features are supervised by a dedicated generalised heatmap regression loss (GHRL). Instead of introducing external visual/text prompts, we devise keypoints clustering to generate body part biases, aligning them with image context to generate corresponding instance-level prompts. Second, we propose a novel interactive transformer that takes feature slices as input tokens without performing spatial splitting. In addition, to enhance the capability of the KIT model, we design an adaptive weight strategy to address the imbalance issue among different keypoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IJCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, most existing methods do not operate well for testing images whose distribution is far from that of training data. This problem might be alleviated by involving diverse data during training, however it is non-trivial to collect such diverse data with corresponding labels (i.e. 3D pose). In this paper, we introduced an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 3D pose estimation that utilizes the unlabeled data in addition to labeled data via masked image modeling (MIM) framework. Foreground-centric reconstruction and attention regularization are further proposed to increase the effectiveness of unlabeled data usage. Experiments are conducted on the various datasets in human and hand pose estimation tasks, especially using the cross-domain scenario. We demonstrated the effectiveness of ours by achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy on all datasets.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[V-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17434v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception. Our model and dataset will be made open source upon acceptance of the paper. Project website: https://lhy.xyz/projects/v-hop/</p></details> |  | None |

However, occlusions from plant foliage often hinder accurate shape and pose estimation. Therefore, we propose an active fruit shape and pose estimation method that physically manipulates occluding leaves to reveal hidden fruits. This paper introduces a framework that plans robot actions to maximize visibility and minimize leaf damage. We developed a novel scene-consistent shape completion technique to improve fruit estimation under heavy occlusion and utilize a perception-driven deformation graph model to predict leaf deformation during planning. Experiments on artificial and real sweet pepper plants demonstrate that our method enables robots to safely move leaves aside, exposing fruits for accurate shape and pose estimation, outperforming baseline methods.

To predict a single output 3D pose sequence, we generate and aggregate multiple 3D pose hypotheses. For better aggregation results, we develop a method to score these hypotheses during training, effectively integrating conformal prediction into the learning process. This process results in a differentiable conformal predictor that is trained end2end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned scoring model is used as the conformity score, and the 3D pose estimator is combined with a conformal predictor to select the most accurate hypotheses for downstream aggregation. Our results indicate that using a simple mean aggregation on the conformal prediction-filtered hypotheses set yields competitive results. When integrated with more sophisticated aggregation techniques, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in real-world scenarios, issues such as occlusion, noise interference, and missing viewpoints can severely affect pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce the task of Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation. Traditional 3D pose estimation methods often rely on multi-stage networks and modular combinations, which can lead to cumulative errors and increased training complexity, making them unable to effectively address deficiency-aware estimation. To this end, we propose DeProPose, a flexible method that simplifies the network architecture to reduce training complexity and avoid information loss in multi-stage designs. Additionally, the model innovatively introduces a multi-view feature fusion mechanism based on relative projection error, which effectively utilizes information from multiple viewpoints and dynamically assigns weights, enabling efficient integration and enhanced robustness to overcome deficiency-aware 3D Pose Estimation challenges. Furthermore, to thoroughly evaluate this end-to-end multi-view 3D human pose estimation model and to advance research on occlusion-related challenges, we have developed a novel 3D human pose estimation dataset, termed the Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation (DA-3DPE) dataset. This dataset encompasses a wide range of deficiency scenarios, including noise interference, missing viewpoints, and occlusion challenges. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DeProPose not only excels in addressing the deficiency-aware problem but also shows improvement in conventional scenarios, providing a powerful and user-friendly solution for 3D human pose estimation.

| **[RGB-Only Gaussian Splatting SLAM for Unbounded Outdoor Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15633v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM, as it can produce high-fidelity novel views. However, previous GS-based methods primarily target indoor scenes and rely on RGB-D sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, hence underperforming in outdoor scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a RGB-only gaussian splatting SLAM method for unbounded outdoor scenes--OpenGS-SLAM. Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network to generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared to commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene geometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then, we propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous optimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing system tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper for the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap mapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8\% of previous 3DGS methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

Existing online gravity estimation methods rely on pose estimation combined with IMU measurements, which is considered best practice when direct velocity measurements are unavailable. However, with radar sensors providing direct velocity data-a measurement not yet utilized for gravity estimation-we found a significant opportunity to improve gravity estimation accuracy substantially. GaRLIO, the proposed gravity-enhanced Radar-LiDAR-Inertial Odometry, can robustly predict gravity to reduce vertical drift while simultaneously enhancing state estimation performance using pointwise velocity measurements. Furthermore, GaRLIO ensures robustness in dynamic environments by utilizing radar to remove dynamic objects from LiDAR point clouds. Our method is validated through experiments in various environments prone to vertical drift, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional LiDAR-Inertial Odometry methods.

In this paper, we consider the performance of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in tracking 3D facial motion in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We first analyze a noise-free environment where the state transition is purely deterministic, demonstrating that UKF outperforms EKF by achieving lower mean squared error (MSE) due to its ability to capture higher-order nonlinearities. However, when stochastic noise is introduced, EKF exhibits superior robustness, maintaining lower mean square error (MSE) compared to UKF, which becomes more sensitive to measurement noise and occlusions. Our results highlight that UKF is preferable for high-precision applications in controlled environments, whereas EKF is better suited for real-world scenarios with unpredictable noise. These findings provide practical insights for selecting the appropriate filtering technique in 3D facial tracking applications, such as motion capture and facial recognition.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures | None |
