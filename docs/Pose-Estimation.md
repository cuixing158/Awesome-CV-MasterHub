| **[DualPM: Dual Posed-Canonical Point Maps for 3D Shape and Pose Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04464v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of data representation is a key factor in the success of deep learning in geometric tasks. For instance, DUSt3R has recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction, and showing that one can reduce all the key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem, namely, the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce the Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image, one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object, and the other to a canonical version of the object at rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction, seeing through self-occlusions to obtain the complete shape of the object. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation reduce to the prediction of the DualPMs. We demonstrate empirically that this representation is a good target for a deep network to predict; specifically, we consider modeling horses, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on 3D synthetic data, consisting of a single model of a horse, while generalizing very well to real images. With this, we improve by a large margin previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of this type of objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

| **[STEP: Simultaneous Tracking and Estimation of Pose for Animals and Humans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13344v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce STEP, a novel framework utilizing Transformer-based discriminative model prediction for simultaneous tracking and estimation of pose across diverse animal species and humans. We are inspired by the fact that the human brain exploits spatiotemporal continuity and performs concurrent localization and pose estimation despite the specialization of brain areas for form and motion processing. Traditional discriminative models typically require predefined target states for determining model weights, a challenge we address through Gaussian Map Soft Prediction (GMSP) and Offset Map Regression Adapter (OMRA) Modules. These modules remove the necessity of keypoint target states as input, streamlining the process. Our method starts with a known target state initialized through a pre-trained detector or manual initialization in the initial frame of a given video sequence. It then seamlessly tracks the target and estimates keypoints of anatomical importance as output for subsequent frames. Unlike prevalent top-down pose estimation methods, our approach doesn't rely on per-frame target detections due to its tracking capability. This facilitates a significant advancement in inference efficiency and potential applications. We train and validate our approach on datasets encompassing diverse species. Our experiments demonstrate superior results compared to existing methods, opening doors to various applications, including but not limited to action recognition and behavioral analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UniHOPE: A Unified Approach for Hand-Only and Hand-Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13303v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 3D pose of hand and potential hand-held object from monocular images is a longstanding challenge. Yet, existing methods are specialized, focusing on either bare-hand or hand interacting with object. No method can flexibly handle both scenarios and their performance degrades when applied to the other scenario. In this paper, we propose UniHOPE, a unified approach for general 3D hand-object pose estimation, flexibly adapting both scenarios. Technically, we design a grasp-aware feature fusion module to integrate hand-object features with an object switcher to dynamically control the hand-object pose estimation according to grasping status. Further, to uplift the robustness of hand pose estimation regardless of object presence, we generate realistic de-occluded image pairs to train the model to learn object-induced hand occlusions, and formulate multi-level feature enhancement techniques for learning occlusion-invariant features. Extensive experiments on three commonly-used benchmarks demonstrate UniHOPE's SOTA performance in addressing hand-only and hand-object scenarios. Code will be released on https://github.com/JoyboyWang/UniHOPE_Pytorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/JoyboyWang/UniHOPE_Pytorch) |
| **[Classroom-Inspired Multi-Mentor Distillation with Adaptive Learning Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20237v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose ClassroomKD, a novel multi-mentor knowledge distillation framework inspired by classroom environments to enhance knowledge transfer between the student and multiple mentors with different knowledge levels. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed mentor-student relationships, our framework dynamically selects and adapts the teaching strategies of diverse mentors based on their effectiveness for each data sample. ClassroomKD comprises two main modules: the Knowledge Filtering (KF) module and the Mentoring module. The KF Module dynamically ranks mentors based on their performance for each input, activating only high-quality mentors to minimize error accumulation and prevent information loss. The Mentoring Module adjusts the distillation strategy by tuning each mentor's influence according to the dynamic performance gap between the student and mentors, effectively modulating the learning pace. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and 2D human pose estimation (COCO Keypoints and MPII Human Pose) demonstrate that ClassroomKD outperforms existing knowledge distillation methods for different network architectures. Our results highlight that a dynamic and adaptive approach to mentor selection and guidance leads to more effective knowledge transfer, paving the way for enhanced model performance through distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IntelliSys 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Knowledge Distillation for Compact and Efficient 6DoF Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13053v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compact and efficient 6DoF object pose estimation is crucial in applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and space autonomous navigation systems, where lightweight models are critical for real-time accurate performance. This paper introduces a novel uncertainty-aware end-to-end Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework focused on keypoint-based 6DoF pose estimation. Keypoints predicted by a large teacher model exhibit varying levels of uncertainty that can be exploited within the distillation process to enhance the accuracy of the student model while ensuring its compactness. To this end, we propose a distillation strategy that aligns the student and teacher predictions by adjusting the knowledge transfer based on the uncertainty associated with each teacher keypoint prediction. Additionally, the proposed KD leverages this uncertainty-aware alignment of keypoints to transfer the knowledge at key locations of their respective feature maps. Experiments on the widely-used LINEMOD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving superior 6DoF object pose estimation with lightweight models compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Further validation on the SPEED+ dataset for spacecraft pose estimation highlights the robustness of our approach under diverse 6DoF pose estimation scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PoseSyn: Synthesizing Diverse 3D Pose Data from In-the-Wild 2D Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13025v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite considerable efforts to enhance the generalization of 3D pose estimators without costly 3D annotations, existing data augmentation methods struggle in real world scenarios with diverse human appearances and complex poses. We propose PoseSyn, a novel data synthesis framework that transforms abundant in the wild 2D pose dataset into diverse 3D pose image pairs. PoseSyn comprises two key components: Error Extraction Module (EEM), which identifies challenging poses from the 2D pose datasets, and Motion Synthesis Module (MSM), which synthesizes motion sequences around the challenging poses. Then, by generating realistic 3D training data via a human animation model aligned with challenging poses and appearances PoseSyn boosts the accuracy of various 3D pose estimators by up to 14% across real world benchmarks including various backgrounds and occlusions, challenging poses, and multi view scenarios. Extensive experiments further confirm that PoseSyn is a scalable and effective approach for improving generalization without relying on expensive 3D annotations, regardless of the pose estimator's model size or design.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> | None |
| **[UNOPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with an Unposed RGB-D Reference Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16106v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unseen object pose estimation methods often rely on CAD models or multiple reference views, making the onboarding stage costly. To simplify reference acquisition, we aim to estimate the unseen object's pose through a single unposed RGB-D reference image. While previous works leverage reference images as pose anchors to limit the range of relative pose, our scenario presents significant challenges since the relative transformation could vary across the entire SE(3) space. Moreover, factors like occlusion, sensor noise, and extreme geometry could result in low viewpoint overlap. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach and benchmark, termed UNOPose, for unseen one-reference-based object pose estimation. Building upon a coarse-to-fine paradigm, UNOPose constructs an SE(3)-invariant reference frame to standardize object representation despite pose and size variations. To alleviate small overlap across viewpoints, we recalibrate the weight of each correspondence based on its predicted likelihood of being within the overlapping region. Evaluated on our proposed benchmark based on the BOP Challenge, UNOPose demonstrates superior performance, significantly outperforming traditional and learning-based methods in the one-reference setting and remaining competitive with CAD-model-based methods.

| **[BRIGHT-VO: Brightness-Guided Hybrid Transformer for Visual Odometry with Multi-modality Refinement Module](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08659v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual odometry (VO) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and other related tasks by estimating the position and orientation of a camera based on visual input. Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods. For widespread use and further development, the research work is fully open-source at https://github.com/Anastasiawd/BrightVO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Metho...</summary><p>Method mistakes appearing in this paper</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Anastasiawd/BrightVO) |
| **[Self-Supervised Monocular 4D Scene Reconstruction for Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09145v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric videos provide valuable insights into human interactions with the physical world, which has sparked growing interest in the computer vision and robotics communities. A critical challenge in fully understanding the geometry and dynamics of egocentric videos is dense scene reconstruction. However, the lack of high-quality labeled datasets in this field has hindered the effectiveness of current supervised learning methods. In this work, we aim to address this issue by exploring an self-supervised dynamic scene reconstruction approach. We introduce EgoMono4D, a novel model that unifies the estimation of multiple variables necessary for Egocentric Monocular 4D reconstruction, including camera intrinsic, camera poses, and video depth, all within a fast feed-forward framework. Starting from pretrained single-frame depth and intrinsic estimation model, we extend it with camera poses estimation and align multi-frame results on large-scale unlabeled egocentric videos. We evaluate EgoMono4D in both in-domain and zero-shot generalization settings, achieving superior performance in dense pointclouds sequence reconstruction compared to all baselines. EgoMono4D represents the first attempt to apply self-supervised learning for pointclouds sequence reconstruction to the label-scarce egocentric field, enabling fast, dense, and generalizable reconstruction. The interactable visualization, code and trained models are released https://egomono4d.github.io/</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gun Detection Using Combined Human Pose and Weapon Appearance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12215v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing frequency of firearm-related incidents has necessitated advancements in security and surveillance systems, particularly in firearm detection within public spaces. Traditional gun detection methods rely on manual inspections and continuous human monitoring of CCTV footage, which are labor-intensive and prone to high false positive and negative rates. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates human pose estimation with weapon appearance recognition using deep learning techniques. Unlike prior studies that focus on either body pose estimation or firearm detection in isolation, our method jointly analyzes posture and weapon presence to enhance detection accuracy in real-world, dynamic environments. To train our model, we curated a diverse dataset comprising images from open-source repositories such as IMFDB and Monash Guns, supplemented with AI-generated and manually collected images from web sources. This dataset ensures robust generalization and realistic performance evaluation under various surveillance conditions. Our research aims to improve the precision and reliability of firearm detection systems, contributing to enhanced public safety and threat mitigation in high-risk areas.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TACO: Taming Diffusion for in-the-wild Video Amodal Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12049v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can infer complete shapes and appearances of objects from limited visual cues, relying on extensive prior knowledge of the physical world. However, completing partially observable objects while ensuring consistency across video frames remains challenging for existing models, especially for unstructured, in-the-wild videos. This paper tackles the task of Video Amodal Completion (VAC), which aims to generate the complete object consistently throughout the video given a visual prompt specifying the object of interest. Leveraging the rich, consistent manifolds learned by pre-trained video diffusion models, we propose a conditional diffusion model, TACO, that repurposes these manifolds for VAC. To enable its effective and robust generalization to challenging in-the-wild scenarios, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset with multiple difficulty levels by systematically imposing occlusions onto un-occluded videos. Building on this, we devise a progressive fine-tuning paradigm that starts with simpler recovery tasks and gradually advances to more complex ones. We demonstrate TACO's versatility on a wide range of in-the-wild videos from Internet, as well as on diverse, unseen datasets commonly used in autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene understanding. Moreover, we show that TACO can be effectively applied to various downstream tasks like object reconstruction and pose estimation, highlighting its potential to facilitate physical world understanding and reasoning.

| **[DVMNet++: Rethinking Relative Pose Estimation for Unseen Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13683v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the relative pose of a previously unseen object between two images is pivotal to the success of generalizable object pose estimation. Existing approaches typically predict 3D translation utilizing the ground-truth object bounding box and approximate 3D rotation with a large number of discrete hypotheses. This strategy makes unrealistic assumptions about the availability of ground truth and incurs a computationally expensive process of scoring each hypothesis at test time. By contrast, we rethink the problem of relative pose estimation for unseen objects by presenting a Deep Voxel Matching Network (DVMNet++). Our method computes the relative object pose in a single pass, eliminating the need for ground-truth object bounding boxes and rotation hypotheses. We achieve open-set object detection by leveraging image feature embedding and natural language understanding as reference. The detection result is then employed to approximate the translation parameters and crop the object from the query image. For rotation estimation, we map the two RGB images, i.e., reference and cropped query, to their respective voxelized 3D representations. The resulting voxels are passed through a rotation estimation module, which aligns the voxels and computes the rotation in an end-to-end fashion by solving a least-squares problem. To enhance robustness, we introduce a weighted closest voxel algorithm capable of mitigating the impact of noisy voxels. We conduct extensive experiments on the CO3D, Objaverse, LINEMOD, and LINEMOD-O datasets, demonstrating that our approach delivers more accurate relative pose estimates for novel objects at a lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released at https://github.com/sailor-z/DVMNet/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/sailor-z/DVMNet) |

Fiducial markers, such as the AprilTag visual fiducial system, yield a relative pose measurement from a single marker detection and provide a powerful tool for pose estimation. In this paper, we perform a Lie algebraic nonlinear observability analysis on a nonlinear dual quaternion system that is composed of a relative pose measurement model and a relative motion model. We prove that many common dual quaternion expressions yield Jacobian matrices with advantageous block structures and rank properties that are beneficial for analysis. We show that using a dual quaternion representation yields an observability matrix with a simple block triangular structure and satisfies the necessary full rank condition.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 0 figures, 1 table, presented at 2024 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> | None |

Existing works propose training-heavy methods relying on either expensive yet inaccurate real-world annotations or controllable yet monotonous synthetic data that do not generalize well to unseen objects or domains. We present Diorama, the first zero-shot open-world system that holistically models 3D scenes from single-view RGB observations without requiring end-to-end training or human annotations. We show the feasibility of our approach by decomposing the problem into subtasks and introduce robust, generalizable solutions to each: architecture reconstruction, 3D shape retrieval, object pose estimation, and scene layout optimization. We evaluate our system on both synthetic and real-world data to show we significantly outperform baselines from prior work. We also demonstrate generalization to internet images and the text-to-scene task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bring Your Rear Cameras for Egocentric 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11652v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric 3D human pose estimation has been actively studied using cameras installed in front of a head-mounted device (HMD). While frontal placement is the optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it remains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion and limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods often fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD users tilt their heads upward (a common motion in human activities). A key limitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body, despite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this paper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras in the HMD design for full-body tracking. We also show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal for existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors without effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a new transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with multi-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose tracking. Moreover, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and Ego4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new camera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose tracking compared to only frontal placements. The proposed method achieves significant improvement over the current state of the art (>10% on MPJPE). We will release the source code, trained models, and new datasets on our project page https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/EgoRear/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/EgoRear/</p></details> | None |
| **[Online Test-time Adaptation for 3D Human Pose Estimation: A Practical Perspective with Estimated 2D Poses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11194v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online test-time adaptation for 3D human pose estimation is used for video streams that differ from training data. Ground truth 2D poses are used for adaptation, but only estimated 2D poses are available in practice. This paper addresses adapting models to streaming videos with estimated 2D poses. Comparing adaptations reveals the challenge of limiting estimation errors while preserving accurate pose information. To this end, we propose adaptive aggregation, a two-stage optimization, and local augmentation for handling varying levels of estimated pose error. First, we perform adaptive aggregation across videos to initialize the model state with labeled representative samples. Within each video, we use a two-stage optimization to benefit from 2D fitting while minimizing the impact of erroneous updates. Second, we employ local augmentation, using adjacent confident samples to update the model before adapting to the current non-confident sample. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art by a large margin, advancing adaptation towards more practical settings of using estimated 2D poses.</p></details> |  | None |

Pre-training with large-scale images achieves promising results in various tasks, but prior methods for 3D hand pose pre-training have not fully utilized the potential of diverse hand images accessible from in-the-wild videos. To facilitate scalable pre-training, we first prepare an extensive pool of hand images from in-the-wild videos and design our pre-training method with contrastive learning. Specifically, we collect over 2.0M hand images from recent human-centric videos, such as 100DOH and Ego4D. To extract discriminative information from these images, we focus on the similarity of hands: pairs of non-identical samples with similar hand poses. We then propose a novel contrastive learning method that embeds similar hand pairs closer in the feature space. Our method not only learns from similar samples but also adaptively weights the contrastive learning loss based on inter-sample distance, leading to additional performance gains. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional contrastive learning approaches that produce positive pairs sorely from a single image with data augmentation. We achieve significant improvements over the state-of-the-art method (PeCLR) in various datasets, with gains of 15% on FreiHand, 10% on DexYCB, and 4% on AssemblyHands.

| **[Fast and Robust Localization for Humanoid Soccer Robot via Iterative Landmark Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11020v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate robot localization is essential for effective operation. Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is commonly used with known maps but is computationally expensive due to landmark matching for each particle. Humanoid robots face additional challenges, including sensor noise from locomotion vibrations and a limited field of view (FOV) due to camera placement. This paper proposes a fast and robust localization method via iterative landmark matching (ILM) for humanoid robots. The iterative matching process improves the accuracy of the landmark association so that it does not need MCL to match landmarks to particles. Pose estimation with the outlier removal process enhances its robustness to measurement noise and faulty detections. Furthermore, an additional filter can be utilized to fuse inertial data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and pose data from localization. We compared ILM with Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which shows that ILM method is more robust towards the error in the initial guess and easier to get a correct matching. We also compared ILM with the Augmented Monte Carlo Localization (aMCL), which shows that ILM method is much faster than aMCL and even more accurate. The proposed method's effectiveness is thoroughly evaluated through experiments and validated on the humanoid robot ARTEMIS during RoboCup 2024 adult-sized soccer competition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Clothes-Changing Person Re-identification Based On Skeleton Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10759v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothes-Changing Person Re-Identification (ReID) aims to recognize the same individual across different videos captured at various times and locations. This task is particularly challenging due to changes in appearance, such as clothing, hairstyle, and accessories. We propose a Clothes-Changing ReID method that uses only skeleton data and does not use appearance features. Traditional ReID methods often depend on appearance features, leading to decreased accuracy when clothing changes. Our approach utilizes a spatio-temporal Graph Convolution Network (GCN) encoder to generate a skeleton-based descriptor for each individual. During testing, we improve accuracy by aggregating predictions from multiple segments of a video clip. Evaluated on the CCVID dataset with several different pose estimation models, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a robust and efficient solution for Clothes-Changing ReID.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Consistent multi-animal pose estimation in cattle using dynamic Kalman filter based tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10450v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, studying animal behaviour with the help of computer vision has become more popular. Replacing human observers by computer vision lowers the cost of data collection and therefore allows to collect more extensive datasets. However, the majority of available computer vision algorithms to study animal behaviour is highly tailored towards a single research objective, limiting possibilities for data reuse. In this perspective, pose-estimation in combination with animal tracking offers opportunities to yield a higher level representation capturing both the spatial and temporal component of animal behaviour. Such a higher level representation allows to answer a wide variety of research questions simultaneously, without the need to develop repeatedly tailored computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we therefore first cope with several weaknesses of current pose-estimation algorithms and thereafter introduce KeySORT (Keypoint Simple and Online Realtime Tracking). KeySORT deploys an adaptive Kalman filter to construct tracklets in a bounding-box free manner, significantly improving the temporal consistency of detected keypoints. In this paper, we focus on pose estimation in cattle, but our methodology can easily be generalised to any other animal species. Our test results indicate our algorithm is able to detect up to 80% of the ground truth keypoints with high accuracy, with only a limited drop in performance when daylight recordings are compared to nightvision recordings. Moreover, by using KeySORT to construct skeletons, the temporal consistency of generated keypoint coordinates was largely improved, offering opportunities with regard to automated behaviour monitoring of animals.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

The core of our method lies in a novel transformer-based network architecture. In particular, our model starts with an image encoder that maps each image to a list of visual tokens. All visual tokens are concatenated with additional inserted learnable camera tokens. The obtained tokens then fully communicate with each other within a tailored transformer decoder. The camera tokens causally aggregate features from visual tokens of different views, and further modulate them frame-wisely to inject view-dependent features. 3D Gaussian splats and camera pose parameters can then be estimated via different prediction heads. Experiments show that VicaSplat surpasses baseline methods for multi-view inputs, and achieves comparable performance to prior two-view approaches. Remarkably, VicaSplat also demonstrates exceptional cross-dataset generalization capability on the ScanNet benchmark, achieving superior performance without any fine-tuning.

To equip models with such capabilities, many researchers predefine the parse graph of body structure to design HPE frameworks. However, these frameworks struggle to adapt to instances that deviate from the predefined parse graph and they are often parameter-heavy. Unlike them, we view the feature map holistically, much like the human body. It can be optimized using parse graphs, where nodes' implicit feature representation boosts adaptability, avoiding rigid structural limitations. In this paper, we design the Refinement Module based on the Parse Graph of feature map (RMPG), which includes two stages: top-down decomposition and bottom-up combination. In the first stage, the feature map is constructed into a tree structure through recursive decomposition, with each node representing a sub-feature map, thereby achieving hierarchical modeling of features. In the second stage, context information is calculated and sub-feature maps with context are recursively connected to gradually build a refined feature map. Additionally, we design a hierarchical network with fewer parameters using multiple RMPG modules to model the context relations and hierarchies in the parse graph of body structure for HPE, some of which are supervised to obtain context relations among body parts. Our network achieves excellent results on multiple mainstream human pose datasets and the effectiveness of RMPG is proven on different methods. The code of RMPG will be open.</p></details> |  | None |

Given a text query, RGS determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot's workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation. Recent studies leverage powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visually grounding free-flowing natural language in real-world robotic execution. However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi-CS, featuring hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios: Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi-CS features a lightweight decoder combined with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide open-set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open-vocabulary performance. We validate our approach through real-world RGS experiments using a 7-DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33\% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop scenes.

Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF) signals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the signal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus on single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot generalize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance. Specifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are entangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also intertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific confounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates counterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE trains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how human body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate skeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for generative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences between counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific confounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent representations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new subjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three public datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental results show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces estimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for cross-environment HPE.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

Despite recent advancements in foundation model adaptation to monocular depth estimation of endoscopic scenes via self-supervised learning (SSL), no prior work has explored their use for pose estimation. These methods rely on low rank-based adaptation approaches, which constrain model updates to a low-rank space. We propose Endo-FASt3r, the first monocular SSL depth and pose estimation framework that uses foundation models for both tasks. We extend the Reloc3r relative pose estimation foundation model by designing Reloc3rX, introducing modifications necessary for convergence in SSL. We also present DoMoRA, a novel adaptation technique that enables higher-rank updates and faster convergence. Experiments on the SCARED dataset show that Endo-FASt3r achieves a substantial $10\%$ improvement in pose estimation and a $2\%$ improvement in depth estimation over prior work. Similar performance gains on the Hamlyn and StereoMIS datasets reinforce the generalisability of Endo-FASt3r across different datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the critical challenge of achieving reliable localization in low-texture environments, where traditional point-based systems often fail due to insufficient visual features, we introduce a novel approach leveraging Global Primitives structural information to improve the system's robustness and accuracy performance. Our key innovation lies in constructing vanishing points from line features and proposing a weighted fusion strategy to build Global Primitives in the world coordinate system. This strategy associates multiple frames with non-overlapping regions and formulates a multi-frame reprojection error optimization, significantly improving tracking accuracy in texture-scarce scenarios. Evaluations on various datasets show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory precision, particularly in challenging environments.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior art usually solves these problems separately, we argue that joint optimization of skeletal motion with a 3D renderable body model brings synergistic effects, i.e. yields more precise motion capture and improved visual quality of real-time rendering of avatars. To achieve this, we introduce a novel animatable avatar with 3D Gaussians rigged on a personalized mesh and propose to optimize the motion sequence with time-dependent MLPs that provide accurate and temporally consistent pose estimates. We first evaluate our method on highly challenging yoga poses and demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on multi-view human pose estimation, reducing error by 35% on body joints and 45% on hand joints compared to keypoint-based methods. At the same time, our method significantly boosts the visual quality of animatable avatars (+2dB PSNR on novel view synthesis) on diverse challenging subjects.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures | None |

Compared to traditional geometric methods prioritizing texture-affluent features like edges, our keypoint selector employs the learned uncertainty to filter out the low-quality features based on global inconsistency. In contrast to the learning-based algorithms that model the scale-agnostic diagonal weight matrix for covariance, we design a metrics-aware covariance model to capture the spatial error during keypoint registration and the correlations between different axes. Integrating this covariance model into pose graph optimization enhances the robustness and reliability of pose estimation, particularly in challenging environments with varying illumination, feature density, and motion patterns. On public benchmark datasets, MAC-VO outperforms existing VO algorithms and even some SLAM algorithms in challenging environments. The covariance map also provides valuable information about the reliability of the estimated poses, which can benefit decision-making for autonomous systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods always struggle with either low rendering qualities (\eg, visual fidelity and physically plausible HOIs) or high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose HOGS (Human-Object Rendering via 3D Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework for efficient and physically plausible HOI rendering from sparse views. Specifically, HOGS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physics-aware optimization process. It incorporates a Human Pose Refinement module for accurate pose estimation and a Sparse-View Human-Object Contact Prediction module for efficient contact region identification. This combination enables coherent joint rendering of human and object Gaussians while enforcing physically plausible interactions. Extensive experiments on the HODome dataset demonstrate that HOGS achieves superior rendering quality, efficiency, and physical plausibility compared to existing methods. We further show its extensibility to hand-object grasp rendering tasks, presenting its broader applicability to articulated object interactions.</p></details> |  | None |

Commonly used publicly-available AD datasets typically contain large amounts of car and vehicle object instances but a low number of cyclist instances, usually with limited appearance and pose diversity. This cyclist training data scarcity problem not only limits the generalization of deep-learning perception models for cyclist semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and cyclist crossing intention prediction, but also limits research on new cyclist-related tasks such as fine-grained cyclist pose estimation and spatio-temporal analysis under complex interactions between humans and articulated objects. To address this data scarcity problem, in this paper we propose a framework to generate synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist data assets that can be used to generate training data for different tasks. In our framework, we designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that we use to train a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based reconstruction and image rendering method. We then propose a parametric bicycle 3DGS composition model to assemble 8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information from cyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (rider pedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person, while automatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicycles using a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics pose refinement. We present both, qualitative and quantitative results where we compare our generated cyclists against those from a recent stable diffusion-based method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Object-Pose Estimation With Neural Population Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13403v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic assembly tasks require object-pose estimation, particularly for tasks that avoid costly mechanical constraints. Object symmetry complicates the direct mapping of sensory input to object rotation, as the rotation becomes ambiguous and lacks a unique training target. Some proposed solutions involve evaluating multiple pose hypotheses against the input or predicting a probability distribution, but these approaches suffer from significant computational overhead. Here, we show that representing object rotation with a neural population code overcomes these limitations, enabling a direct mapping to rotation and end-to-end learning. As a result, population codes facilitate fast and accurate pose estimation. On the T-LESS dataset, we achieve inference in 3.2 milliseconds on an Apple M1 CPU and a Maximum Symmetry-Aware Surface Distance accuracy of 84.7% using only gray-scale image input, compared to 69.7% accuracy when directly mapping to pose.</p></details> |  | None |

The accuracy of current state-of-the-art 3D acoustic modeling algorithms is highly dependent on accurate pose estimation; small errors in sensor pose can lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the neural scene representation and sonar poses. Our algorithm does so by parameterizing the 6DoF poses as learnable parameters and backpropagating gradients through the neural renderer and implicit representation. We validated our algorithm on both real and simulated datasets. It produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions even under significant pose drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures.

Visual feature matching is crucial to vision-based pipelines but remains particularly challenging in natural outdoor settings due to perceptual aliasing. We address this issue in vineyards, where repetitive vine trunks and other natural elements generate ambiguous descriptors that hinder reliable feature matching. We hypothesise that semantic information tied to keypoint positions can alleviate perceptual aliasing by enhancing keypoint descriptor distinctiveness. To this end, we introduce a keypoint semantic integration technique that improves the descriptors in semantically meaningful regions within the image, enabling more accurate differentiation even among visually similar local features. We validate this approach in two vineyard perception tasks: (i) relative pose estimation and (ii) visual localisation. Across all tested keypoint types and descriptors, our method improves matching accuracy by 12.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness over multiple months in challenging vineyard conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/LCAS/GAIA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/LCAS/GAIA) |

This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations.

While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

The proposed method addresses the challenges of aligning aerial and ground data for pose estimation, which is crucial for accurate point-to-point navigation in GPS-degraded environments. By integrating information from both perspectives into a factor graph framework, our approach effectively estimates the robot's global position and orientation. Additionally, we enhance the repeatability of deep-learned keypoints for metric localisation in forests by incorporating a semantically-guided regression loss. This loss encourages greater attention to wooden structures, e.g., tree trunks, which serve as stable and distinguishable features, thereby improving the consistency of keypoints and increasing the success rate of global registration, a process we refer to as re-localisation. The re-localisation module along with the factor-graph structure, populated by odometry and ground-to-aerial factors over time, allows global localisation under dense canopies. We validate the performance of our method through extensive experiments in three forest scenarios, demonstrating its global localisation capability and superiority over alternative state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and robustness in these challenging environments. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve drift-free localisation with bounded positioning errors, ensuring reliable and safe robot navigation through dense forests.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> | None |

However, the world in which we live is dynamic, characterized by numerous interactions between the environment and humans or robotic agents. Static semantic maps are unable to capture this information, and the naive solution of rescanning the environment after every change is both costly and ineffective in tracking e.g. objects being stored away in drawers. With Lost & Found we present an approach that addresses this limitation. Based solely on egocentric recordings with corresponding hand position and camera pose estimates, we are able to track the 6DoF poses of the moving object within the detected interaction interval. These changes are applied online to a transformable scene graph that captures object-level relations. Compared to state-of-the-art object pose trackers, our approach is more reliable in handling the challenging egocentric viewpoint and the lack of depth information. It outperforms the second-best approach by 34% and 56% for translational and orientational error, respectively, and produces visibly smoother 6DoF object trajectories. In addition, we illustrate how the acquired interaction information in the dynamic scene graph can be employed in the context of robotic applications that would otherwise be unfeasible: We show how our method allows to command a mobile manipulator through teach & repeat, and how information about prior interaction allows a mobile manipulator to retrieve an object hidden in a drawer.

Such long-sequence in-the-wild motions are highly valuable to applications such as motion generation and motion understanding, but are of great challenge to be recovered due to abrupt shot transitions, partial occlusions, and dynamic backgrounds presented in such videos. Existing methods primarily focus on single-shot videos, where continuity is maintained within a single camera view, or simplify multi-shot alignment in camera space only. In this work, we tackle the challenges by integrating an enhanced camera pose estimation with Human Motion Recovery (HMR) by incorporating a shot transition detector and a robust alignment module for accurate pose and orientation continuity across shots. By leveraging a custom motion integrator, we effectively mitigate the problem of foot sliding and ensure temporal consistency in human pose.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of multi-robot cooperative exploration systems. First, we review the evolution of robotic exploration and introduce a modular research framework tailored for multi-robot cooperative exploration. Based on this framework, we systematically categorize and summarize key system components. As a foundational module for multi-robot exploration, the localization and mapping module is primarily introduced by focusing on global and relative pose estimation, as well as multi-robot map merging techniques. The cooperative motion module is further divided into learning-based approaches and multi-stage planning, with the latter encompassing target generation, task allocation, and motion planning strategies. Given the communication constraints of real-world environments, we also analyze the communication module, emphasizing how robots exchange information within local communication ranges and under limited transmission capabilities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions for multi-robot cooperative exploration in light of real-world trends. This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field.</p></details> |  | None |

A combination of GroundingDINO and Segment Anything Model outputs segmented masks from which a sparse point cloud is reconstructed with VGGSfM. Subsequently, the mesh is reconstructed with the Gaussian Splatting method SuGAR. In a final cleaning step, artifacts are removed, resulting in the final 3D mesh of the queried object. We evaluate the method in terms of accuracy and quality of the geometry and texture. Furthermore, we study the impact of imaging conditions such as viewing angle, number of input images, and image overlap on 3D object reconstruction quality, efficiency, and computational scalability.</p></details> | under review | None |

However, due to the complexity of deployment environments or the prevalence of ambiguous-condition objects, the practical application of robotics still faces many challenges, leading to frequent errors. Traditional methods and some LLM-based approaches, although improved, still require substantial human intervention and struggle with autonomous error correction in complex scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboReflect, a novel framework leveraging large vision-language models (LVLMs) to enable self-reflection and autonomous error correction in robotic grasping tasks. RoboReflect allows robots to automatically adjust their strategies based on unsuccessful attempts until successful execution is achieved. The corrected strategies are saved in the memory for future task reference. We evaluate RoboReflect through extensive testing on eight common objects prone to ambiguous conditions of three categories. Our results demonstrate that RoboReflect not only outperforms existing grasp pose estimation methods like AnyGrasp and high-level action planning techniques ReKep with GPT-4V but also significantly enhances the robot's capability to adapt and correct errors independently. These findings underscore the critical importance of autonomous self-reflection in robotic systems while effectively addressing the challenges posed by ambiguous-condition environments.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, this paper introduces a Video Understanding and Reasoning Framework (VURF) based on the reasoning power of LLMs. Ours is a novel approach to extend the utility of LLMs in the context of video tasks, leveraging their capacity to generalize from minimal input and output demonstrations within a contextual framework. We harness their contextual learning capabilities by presenting LLMs with pairs of instructions and their corresponding high-level programs to generate executable visual programs for video understanding. To enhance the program's accuracy and robustness, we implement two important strategies. \emph{Firstly,} we employ a feedback-generation approach, powered by GPT-3.5, to rectify errors in programs utilizing unsupported functions. \emph{Secondly}, taking motivation from recent works on self-refinement of LLM outputs, we introduce an iterative procedure for improving the quality of the in-context examples by aligning the initial outputs to the outputs that would have been generated had the LLM not been bound by the structure of the in-context examples. Our results on several video-specific tasks, including visual QA, video anticipation, pose estimation, and multi-video QA, illustrate these enhancements' efficacy in improving the performance of visual programming approaches for video tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional optical flow estimation methods rely on restrictive assumptions like brightness constancy and slow motion constraints. Recent deep learning-based flow estimations require extensive training on large domain-specific datasets, making them computationally demanding. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) advances have enabled deep learning models to take advantage of optical flow as an important feature for object tracking and motion analysis. Since optical flow is commonly encoded in HSV for visualization, its conversion to RGB for neural network processing is nonlinear and may introduce perceptual distortions. These transformations amplify the sensitivity to estimation errors, potentially affecting the predictive accuracy of the networks. To address these challenges that are influential to the performance of downstream network models, we propose Reynolds flow, a novel training-free flow estimation inspired by the Reynolds transport theorem, offering a principled approach to modeling complex motion dynamics. In addition to conventional HSV-based visualization of Reynolds flow, we also introduce an RGB-encoded representation of Reynolds flow designed to improve flow visualization and feature enhancement for neural networks. We evaluated the effectiveness of Reynolds flow in video-based tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks, tiny object detection on UAVDB, infrared object detection on Anti-UAV, and pose estimation on GolfDB, demonstrate that networks trained with RGB-encoded Reynolds flow achieve SOTA performance, exhibiting improved robustness and efficiency across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  | None |

Robotic pollination has been proposed to supplement natural pollination to ensure global food security due to the decreased population of natural pollinators. However, flower pose estimation for pollination is challenging due to natural variability, flower clusters, and high accuracy demands due to the flowers' fragility when pollinating. This method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate photorealistic synthetic datasets with precise pose annotations, enabling effective knowledge distillation from a high-capacity teacher model to a lightweight student model for efficient inference. The approach was evaluated on both single and multi-arm robotic platforms, achieving a mean pose estimation error of 0.6 cm and 19.14 degrees within a low computational cost. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of FloPE, achieving up to 78.75% pollination success rate and outperforming prior robotic pollination techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS2...</summary><p>IROS2025 under review</p></details> | None |

However, current reconstruction methods often rely on explicit camera pose estimation or fixed viewpoints, restricting their flexibility and practical applicability. We reformulate 3D reconstruction as image-to-image translation and introduce the Relative Coordinate Map (RCM), which aligns multiple unposed images to a main view without pose estimation. While RCM simplifies the process, its lack of global 3D supervision can yield noisy outputs. To address this, we propose Relative Coordinate Gaussians (RCG) as an extension to RCM, which treats each pixel's coordinates as a Gaussian center and employs differentiable rasterization for consistent geometry and pose recovery. Our LucidFusion framework handles an arbitrary number of unposed inputs, producing robust 3D reconstructions within seconds and paving the way for more flexible, pose-free 3D pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, [project page](https://heye0507.github.io/LucidFusion_page/)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://heye0507.github.io/LucidFusion_page) |

The input constraints are often not satisfied in real-world setups, making the approach impractical. We show that unsynchronized videos from unknown poses can generate dynamic neural fields as long as the videos capture human motion. Humans are one of the most common dynamic subjects captured in videos, and their shapes and poses can be estimated using state-of-the-art libraries. While noisy, the estimated human shape and pose parameters provide a decent initialization point to start the highly non-convex and under-constrained problem of training a consistent dynamic neural representation. Given the shape and pose parameters of humans in individual frames, we formulate methods to calculate the time offsets between videos, followed by camera pose estimations that analyze the 3D joint positions. Then, we train the dynamic neural fields employing multiresolution grids while we concurrently refine both time offsets and camera poses. The setup still involves optimizing many parameters; therefore, we introduce a robust progressive learning strategy to stabilize the process. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate spatio-temporal calibration and high-quality scene reconstruction in challenging conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing NeRF-based approaches either lack geometric constraints or require extensive storage for feature matching, limiting their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and novel visual localization approach based on the neural implicit map with complementary features. Specifically, to enforce geometric constraints and reduce storage requirements, we implicitly learn a 3D keypoint descriptor field, avoiding the need to explicitly store point-wise features. To further address the semantic ambiguity of descriptors, we introduce additional semantic contextual feature fields, which enhance the quality and reliability of 2D-3D correspondences. Besides, we propose descriptor similarity distribution alignment to minimize the domain gap between 2D and 3D feature spaces during matching. Finally, we construct the matching graph using both complementary descriptors and contextual features to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondences for 6-DoF pose estimation. Compared with the recent NeRF-based approaches, our method achieves a 3$\times$ faster training speed and a 45$\times$ reduction in model storage. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms or is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art NeRF-based visual localization methods.

However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Fisheye cameras, known for their wide field of view, have inherent geometric benefits. However, their use in depth estimation is restricted by a scarcity of ground truth data and image distortions. We present FisheyeDepth, a self-supervised depth estimation model tailored for fisheye cameras. We incorporate a fisheye camera model into the projection and reprojection stages during training to handle image distortions, thereby improving depth estimation accuracy and training stability. Furthermore, we incorporate real-scale pose information into the geometric projection between consecutive frames, replacing the poses estimated by the conventional pose network. Essentially, this method offers the necessary physical depth for robotic tasks, and also streamlines the training and inference procedures. Additionally, we devise a multi-channel output strategy to improve robustness by adaptively fusing features at various scales, which reduces the noise from real pose data. We demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our model in fisheye image depth estimation through evaluations on public datasets and real-world scenarios.

Although research has used pose estimation techniques to overcome self-occlusions and image distortions caused by head-mounted fisheye images, similar advances in 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) techniques have been limited. We introduce Fish2Mesh, a fisheye-aware transformer-based model designed for 3D egocentric human mesh recovery. We propose an egocentric position embedding block to generate an ego-specific position table for the Swin Transformer to reduce fisheye image distortion. Our model utilizes multi-task heads for SMPL parametric regression and camera translations, estimating 3D and 2D joints as auxiliary loss to support model training. To address the scarcity of egocentric camera data, we create a training dataset by employing the pre-trained 4D-Human model and third-person cameras for weak supervision.

Toward this goal, this paper presents ReJSHand (which stands for Refined Joint and Skeleton Features), a cutting-edge network formulated for real-time hand pose estimation and mesh reconstruction. The proposed framework is designed to accurately predict 3D hand gestures under real-time constraints, which is essential for systems that demand agile and responsive hand motion tracking. The network's design prioritizes computational efficiency without compromising accuracy, a prerequisite for instantaneous robotic interactions. Specifically, ReJSHand comprises a 2D keypoint generator, a 3D keypoint generator, an expansion block, and a feature interaction block for meticulously reconstructing 3D hand poses from 2D imagery. In addition, the multi-head self-attention mechanism and a coordinate attention layer enhance feature representation, streamlining the creation of hand mesh vertices through sophisticated feature mapping and linear transformation. Regarding performance, comprehensive evaluations on the FreiHand dataset demonstrate ReJSHand's computational prowess. It achieves a frame rate of 72 frames per second while maintaining a PA-MPJPE (Position-Accurate Mean Per Joint Position Error) of 6.3 mm and a PA-MPVPE (Position-Accurate Mean Per Vertex Position Error) of 6.4 mm.

Typical robotic calibration approaches, however, are not applicable to surgical robots, such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), due to joint angle measurement errors from cable-drives and the partially visible kinematic chain. Hence, previous works in surgical robotic automation used tracking algorithms to estimate the pose of the surgical tool in real-time and compensate for the joint angle errors. However, a big limitation of these previous tracking works is the initialization step which relied on only keypoints and SolvePnP. In this work, we fully explore the potential of geometric primitives beyond just keypoints with differentiable rendering, cylinders, and construct a versatile pose matching pipeline in a novel pose hypothesis space. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our single-shot calibration method with both calibration consistency and real surgical tasks. As a result, this marker-less calibration approach proves to be a robust and generalizable initialization step for surgical tool tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in the camera coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative camera-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting.

However, current Transformer-based methods for video pose estimation often face challenges in managing redundant temporal information and achieving fine-grained perception because they only focus on processing low-resolution features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale resolution framework that encodes spatio-temporal representations at varying granularities and executes fine-grained perception compensation. Furthermore, we employ a density peaks clustering method to dynamically identify and prioritize tokens that offer important semantic information. This strategy effectively prunes redundant feature tokens, especially those arising from multi-frame features, thereby optimizing computational efficiency without sacrificing semantic richness. Empirically, it sets new benchmarks for both performance and efficiency on three large-scale datasets. Our method achieves a 93.8% improvement in inference speed compared to the baseline, while also enhancing pose estimation accuracy, reaching 87.4 mAP on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we introduce SplatPose, a novel framework that synergizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a dual-branch neural architecture to achieve high-precision pose estimation using only a single RGB image. Central to our approach is the Dual-Attention Ray Scoring Network (DARS-Net), which innovatively decouples positional and angular alignment through geometry-domain attention mechanisms, explicitly modeling directional dependencies to mitigate rotational ambiguity. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine optimization pipeline progressively refines pose estimates by aligning dense 2D features between query images and 3DGS-synthesized views, effectively correcting feature misalignment and depth errors from sparse ray sampling. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SplatPose achieves state-of-the-art 6-DoF pose estimation accuracy in single RGB settings, rivaling approaches that depend on depth or multi-view images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

Most existing methods, however, rely on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth for supervision, which are often difficult to be obtained in industrial applications and are sensitive to noise inputs. We propose viewing CAD reconstruction as a specific instance of sparse-view 3D reconstruction to overcome these limitations. While this reformulation offers a promising perspective, existing 3D reconstruction methods typically require natural images and corresponding camera poses as inputs, which introduces two major significant challenges: (1) modality discrepancy between CAD sketches and natural images, and (2) difficulty of accurate camera pose estimation for CAD sketches. To solve these issues, we first transform the CAD sketches into representations resembling natural images and extract corresponding masks. Next, we manually calculate the camera poses for the orthographic views to ensure accurate alignment within the 3D coordinate system. Finally, we employ a customized sparse-view 3D reconstruction method to achieve high-quality reconstructions from aligned orthographic views. By leveraging raster CAD sketches for self-supervision, our approach eliminates the reliance on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth. Experiments on the Sub-Fusion360 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches in CAD reconstruction performance and exhibits strong robustness to noisy inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

Precise pose estimation is an important task for mobile robots exploring planetary surfaces, as they operate in GPS-denied environments. Although visual odometry provides accurate localization, it is computationally expensive and can fail in dim or high-contrast lighting. Wheel encoders can also provide odometry estimation, but are prone to slipping on the sandy terrain encountered on Mars. Although traditionally a scientific surveying sensor, GPR has been used on Earth for terrain classification and localization through subsurface feature matching. The Perseverance rover and the upcoming ExoMars rover have GPR sensors already equipped to aid in the search of water and mineral resources. We propose to leverage GPR to aid in Mars rover localization. Specifically, we develop a novel GPR-based deep learning model that predicts 1D relative pose translation. We fuse our GPR pose prediction method with inertial and wheel encoder data in a filtering framework to output rover localization. We perform experiments in a Mars analog environment and demonstrate that our GPR-based displacement predictions both outperform wheel encoders and improve multi-modal filtering estimates in high-slip environments. Lastly, we present the first dataset aimed at GPR-based localization in Mars analog environments, which will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and severe occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to handle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose estimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for estimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our approach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a sequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency. First, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth ambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify the subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through canonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then introduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera viewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty and enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset as well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated using the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging our next-best-view strategy, our method achieves high object pose accuracy with substantially fewer viewpoints than heuristic-based policies.</p></details> |  | None |

The coarse pose estimates are directly obtained via 2D-3D correspondences between the 3DGS representation and query image descriptors. In the second stage, the initial pose estimate is refined by minimizing the rendering-based photometric warp loss. Benchmarking on widely used indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrates improvements over recent neural rendering-based localization methods, such as NeRFMatch and PNeRFLoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://gsplatloc.github.io/</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose an approach that utilizes coarse point clouds obtained from miniaturized VL53L5CX Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors (tiny lidars) to localize a target object in the robot's workspace. We first conduct an experimental campaign to calibrate the dependency of sensor readings on relative range and orientation to targets. We then propose a probabilistic sensor model that is validated in an object pose estimation task using a Particle Filter (PF). The results show that the proposed sensor model improves the performance of the localization of the target object with respect to two baselines: one that assumes measurements are free from uncertainty and one in which the confidence is provided by the sensor datasheet.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, conference submission</p></details> | None |

Vision-based methods combining prior maps aim to integrate LiDAR-level accuracy with camera cost efficiency for robust pose estimation. Existing approaches, however, often depend on unreliable interpolation procedures when associating discrete point cloud maps with dense image pixels, which inevitably introduces depth errors and degrades pose estimation accuracy. We propose a monocular visual odometry framework utilizing a continuous 3D Gaussian map, which directly assigns geometrically consistent depth values to all extracted high-gradient points without interpolation. Evaluations on two public datasets demonstrate superior tracking accuracy compared to existing methods. We have released the source code of this work for the development of the community.</p></details> | 7 pages,5 figures | None |
| **[Supervised Visual Docking Network for Unmanned Surface Vehicles Using Auto-labeling in Real-world Water Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03282v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are increasingly applied to water operations such as environmental monitoring and river-map modeling. It faces a significant challenge in achieving precise autonomous docking at ports or stations, still relying on remote human control or external positioning systems for accuracy and safety which limits the full potential of human-out-of-loop deployment for USVs.This paper introduces a novel supervised learning pipeline with the auto-labeling technique for USVs autonomous visual docking. Firstly, we designed an auto-labeling data collection pipeline that appends relative pose and image pair to the dataset. This step does not require conventional manual labeling for supervised learning. Secondly, the Neural Dock Pose Estimator (NDPE) is proposed to achieve relative dock pose prediction without the need for hand-crafted feature engineering, camera calibration, and peripheral markers. Moreover, The NDPE can accurately predict the relative dock pose in real-world water environments, facilitating the implementation of Position-Based Visual Servo (PBVS) and low-level motion controllers for efficient and autonomous docking.Experiments show that the NDPE is robust to the disturbance of the distance and the USV velocity. The effectiveness of our proposed solution is tested and validated in real-world water environments, reflecting its capability to handle real-world autonomous docking tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a scene-agnostic and light-weight visual relocalization framework that leverages semantically labeled 3D lines as a compact map representation. In our framework, the robot localizes itself by capturing a single image, extracting 2D lines, associating them with semantically similar 3D lines in the map, and solving a robust perspective-n-line problem. To address the extremely high outlier ratios~(exceeding 99.5\%) caused by one-to-many ambiguities in semantic matching, we introduce the Saturated Consensus Maximization~(Sat-CM) formulation, which enables accurate pose estimation when the classic Consensus Maximization framework fails. We further propose a fast global solver to the formulated Sat-CM problems, leveraging rigorous interval analysis results to ensure both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for constructing semantic 3D line maps using posed depth images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, which integrates our innovations in robust estimation and practical engineering insights, we conduct extensive experiments on the ScanNet++ dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 14 figurs, arxiv version for paper submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing approaches either require time-consuming offline processing with a complete map, or rely on expensive sensors and substantial computational resources. To address the problems, we propose Floorplan-SLAM, which incorporates floorplan reconstruction tightly into a multi-session SLAM system by seamlessly interacting with plane extraction, pose estimation, and back-end optimization, achieving real-time, high-accuracy, and long-term floorplan reconstruction using only a stereo camera. Specifically, we present a robust plane extraction algorithm that operates in a compact plane parameter space and leverages spatially complementary features to accurately detect planar structures, even in weakly textured scenes. Furthermore, we propose a floorplan reconstruction module tightly coupled with the SLAM system, which uses continuously optimized plane landmarks and poses to formulate and solve a novel optimization problem, thereby enabling real-time incremental floorplan reconstruction. Note that by leveraging the map merging capability of multi-session SLAM, our method supports long-term floorplan reconstruction across multiple sessions without redundant data collection. Experiments on the VECtor and the self-collected datasets indicate that Floorplan-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of plane extraction robustness, pose estimation accuracy, and floorplan reconstruction fidelity and speed, achieving real-time performance at 25-45 FPS without GPU acceleration, which reduces the floorplan reconstruction time for a 1000 square meters scene from over 10 hours to just 9.44 minutes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Category-level Meta-learned NeRF Priors for Efficient Object Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01582v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 3D object mapping, category-level priors enable efficient object reconstruction and canonical pose estimation, requiring only a single prior per semantic category (e.g., chair, book, laptop). Recently, DeepSDF has predominantly been used as a category-level shape prior, but it struggles to reconstruct sharp geometry and is computationally expensive. In contrast, NeRFs capture fine details but have yet to be effectively integrated with category-level priors in a real-time multi-object mapping framework. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRENOM, a Prior-based Efficient Neural Object Mapper that integrates category-level priors with object-level NeRFs to enhance reconstruction efficiency while enabling canonical object pose estimation. PRENOM gets to know objects on a first-name basis by meta-learning on synthetic reconstruction tasks generated from open-source shape datasets. To account for object category variations, it employs a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the NeRF architecture for each category, balancing reconstruction quality and training time. Additionally, prior-based probabilistic ray sampling directs sampling toward expected object regions, accelerating convergence and improving reconstruction quality under constrained resources. Experimental results on a low-end GPU highlight the ability of PRENOM to achieve high-quality reconstructions while maintaining computational feasibility. Specifically, comparisons with prior-free NeRF-based approaches on a synthetic dataset show a 21% lower Chamfer distance, demonstrating better reconstruction quality. Furthermore, evaluations against other approaches using shape priors on a noisy real-world dataset indicate a 13% improvement averaged across all reconstruction metrics, and comparable pose and size estimation accuracy, while being trained for 5x less time.</p></details> |  | None |

LiDAR is a widely used sensor for pose estimation, with odometry and localization being two primary tasks. LiDAR odometry estimates the relative motion between consecutive scans, while LiDAR localization aligns real-time scans with a pre-recorded map to obtain a global pose. Although they have different objectives and application scenarios, both rely on point cloud registration as the underlying technique and face shared challenges of data corruption caused by adverse conditions (e.g., rain). While state-of-the-art (SOTA) pose estimation systems achieved high accuracy on clean data, their robustness to corrupted data remains unclear. In this work, we propose a framework to systematically evaluate five SOTA LiDAR pose estimation systems across 18 synthetic real-world point cloud corruptions. Our experiments reveal that odometry systems degrade significantly under specific corruptions, with relative position errors increasing from 0.5% to more than 80%, while localization systems remain highly robust. We further demonstrate that denoising techniques can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of noise-induced corruptions, and re-training learning-based systems with corrupted data significantly enhances the robustness against various corruption types.</p></details> |  | None |

To estimate the 3D human position from a 2D image, existing methods either depend on the geometric assumption of a fixed camera or use a position regression model trained on datasets containing little camera ego-motion. These methods are vulnerable to fierce camera ego-motion, resulting in inaccurate person localization. We consider person localization as a part of a pose estimation problem. By representing a human with a four-point model, our method jointly estimates the 2D camera attitude and the person's 3D location through optimization. Evaluations on both public datasets and real robot experiments demonstrate our method outperforms baselines in person localization accuracy. Our method is further implemented into a person-following system and deployed on an agile quadruped robot.</p></details> | Under review | None |

However, developing a robust and consistent state estimator remains a significant challenge, as the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) struggles to handle the model nonlinearity, especially for inertial measurement unit (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). To provide a consistent and efficient solution of pose estimation, we propose Eq-LIO, a robust state estimator for tightly coupled LIO systems based on an equivariant filter (EqF). Compared with the invariant Kalman filter based on the $\SE_2(3)$ group structure, the EqF uses the symmetry of the semi-direct product group to couple the system state including IMU bias, navigation state and LiDAR extrinsic calibration state, thereby suppressing linearization error and improving the behavior of the estimator in the event of unexpected state changes. The proposed Eq-LIO owns natural consistency and higher robustness, which is theoretically proven with mathematical derivation and experimentally verified through a series of tests on both public and private datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

However, models trained solely on single-task objectives or generic datasets often lack the contextual information needed for robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified encoder trained on multiple computer vision tasks crucial for urban driving, including depth, pose, and 3D scene flow estimation, as well as semantic, instance, panoptic, and motion segmentation. By integrating these diverse visual cues-similar to human perceptual mechanisms-the encoder captures rich features that enhance navigation-related predictions. We evaluate the model on steering estimation as a downstream task, leveraging its dense latent space. To ensure efficient multi-task learning, we introduce a multi-scale feature network for pose estimation and apply knowledge distillation from a multi-backbone teacher model. Our findings highlight two key findings: (1) the unified encoder achieves competitive performance across all visual perception tasks, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities; and (2) for steering estimation, the frozen unified encoder-leveraging dense latent representations-outperforms both its fine-tuned counterpart and the same frozen model pretrained on generic datasets like ImageNet. These results underline the significance of task-specific visual features and demonstrate the promise of multi-task learning in advancing autonomous driving systems.

Cross-view pose optimization offers an effective solution by directly estimating vehicle pose using satellite-view images. However, existing methods primarily rely on cross-view features at a given pose, neglecting fine-grained contexts for precision and global contexts for robustness against large initial pose errors. To overcome these limitations, we propose PIDLoc, a novel cross-view pose optimization approach inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Using RGB images and LiDAR, the PIDLoc comprises the PID branches to model cross-view feature relationships and the spatially aware pose estimator (SPE) to estimate the pose from these relationships. The PID branches leverage feature differences for local context (P), aggregated feature differences for global context (I), and gradients of feature differences for precise pose adjustment (D) to enhance localization accuracy under large initial pose errors. Integrated with the PID branches, the SPE captures spatial relationships within the PID-branch features for consistent localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the PIDLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-view pose estimation for the KITTI dataset, reducing position error by $37.8\%$ compared with the previous state-of-the-art.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR-25 | None |

Robust transfer from simulation to real flight poses a major challenge, as standard simulators often lack sufficient visual fidelity. To address this, we construct a photorealistic simulation environment of quadrotor racing tracks, called FalconGym, which provides effectively unlimited synthetic images for training. Within FalconGym, we develop a pipelined approach for crossing gates that combines (i) a Neural Pose Estimator (NPE) coupled with a Kalman filter to reliably infer quadrotor poses from single-frame RGB images and IMU data, and (ii) a self-attention-based multi-modal controller that adaptively integrates visual features and pose estimation. This multi-modal design compensates for perception noise and intermittent gate visibility. We train this controller purely in FalconGym with imitation learning and deploy the resulting policy to real hardware with no additional fine-tuning. Simulation experiments on three distinct tracks (circle, U-turn and figure-8) demonstrate that our controller outperforms a vision-only state-of-the-art baseline in both success rate and gate-crossing accuracy. In 30 live hardware flights spanning three tracks and 120 gates, our controller achieves a 95.8% success rate and an average error of just 10 cm when flying through 38 cm-radius gates.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches struggle to maintain consistent scene representations because of numerous moving objects, often treating dynamic elements as outliers rather than explicitly modeling them in the scene representation. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical 3D scene graph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and estimating the pose of dynamic objects and agents. We use fiducial markers to detect dynamic entities and to extract their attributes while improving keyframe selection and implementing new capabilities for dynamic entity mapping. We maintain a hierarchical representation where dynamic objects are registered in the SLAM graph and are constrained with robot keyframes and the floor level of the building with our novel entity-keyframe constraints and intra-entity constraints. By combining semantic and geometric constraints between dynamic entities and the environment, our system jointly optimizes the SLAM graph to estimate the pose of the robot and various dynamic agents and objects while maintaining an accurate map. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves a 27.57% reduction in pose estimation error compared to traditional methods and enables higher-level reasoning about scene dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

However, they introduce uncertainties in hand-object interactions due to their inherent compliance and lack of precise finger proprioception as in rigid hands. These limitations become particularly significant when performing contact-rich tasks like insertion. To address these challenges, additional sensing modalities are required to enable robust insertion capabilities. This letter explores the essential sensing requirements for successful insertion tasks with compliant hands, focusing on the role of visuotactile perception (i.e., visual and tactile perception). We propose a simulation-based multimodal policy learning framework that leverages all-around tactile sensing and an extrinsic depth camera. A transformer-based policy, trained through a teacher-student distillation process, is successfully transferred to a real-world robotic system without further training. Our results emphasize the crucial role of tactile sensing in conjunction with visual perception for accurate object-socket pose estimation, successful sim-to-real transfer and robust task execution.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose RUSSO, a robust underwater SLAM system which fuses stereo camera, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and imaging sonar to achieve robust and accurate localization in challenging underwater environments for 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) estimation. During visual degradation, the system is reduced to a sonar-inertial system estimating 3-DoF poses. The sonar pose estimation serves as a strong prior for IMU propagation, thereby enhancing the reliability of pose estimation with IMU propagation. Additionally, we propose a SLAM initialization method that leverages the imaging sonar to counteract the lack of visual features during the initialization stage of SLAM. We extensively validate RUSSO through experiments in simulator, pool, and sea scenarios. The results demonstrate that RUSSO achieves better robustness and localization accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, especially in visually challenging scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time fusing stereo camera, IMU, and imaging sonar to realize robust underwater SLAM against visual degradation.</p></details> |  | None |

HiBug2 first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, HiBug2 extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches.

In this paper, we propose a compound approach for end-to-end discriminative deep feature learning for person Re-Id based on both body and hand images. We carefully design the Local-Aware Global Attention Network (LAGA-Net), a multi-branch deep network architecture consisting of one branch for spatial attention, one branch for channel attention, one branch for global feature representations and another branch for local feature representations. The attention branches focus on the relevant features of the image while suppressing the irrelevant backgrounds. In order to overcome the weakness of the attention mechanisms, equivariant to pixel shuffling, we integrate relative positional encodings into the spatial attention module to capture the spatial positions of pixels. The global branch intends to preserve the global context or structural information. For the the local branch, which intends to capture the fine-grained information, we perform uniform partitioning to generate stripes on the conv-layer horizontally. We retrieve the parts by conducting a soft partition without explicitly partitioning the images or requiring external cues such as pose estimation. A set of ablation study shows that each component contributes to the increased performance of the LAGA-Net. Extensive evaluations on four popular body-based person Re-Id benchmarks and two publicly available hand datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2108.02234</p></details> | None |

Unlike existing approaches that significantly limit practicality by employing intrusive chirp signals within the audible range, our method utilizes natural music that causes minimal discomfort to humans. Estimating human poses from standard music presents significant challenges. In contrast to sound sources specifically designed for measurement, regular music varies in both volume and pitch. These dynamic changes in signals caused by music are inevitably mixed with alterations in the sound field resulting from human motion, making it hard to extract reliable cues for pose estimation. To address these challenges, BGM2Pose introduces a Contrastive Pose Extraction Module that employs contrastive learning and hard negative sampling to eliminate musical components from the recorded data, isolating the pose information. Additionally, we propose a Frequency-wise Attention Module that enables the model to focus on subtle acoustic variations attributable to human movement by dynamically computing attention across frequency bands. Experiments suggest that our method outperforms the existing methods, demonstrating substantial potential for real-world applications.

However, they often fail to capture the level of detail required for inspection and scene awareness tasks. Conversely, dense SLAM approaches generate richer scene reconstructions but impose a prohibitive computational load to create 3D maps. We present a novel distributed volumetric mapping framework designated as CRADMap that addresses these issues by extending the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ORBSLAM3 [1] system with the COVINS [2] on the backend for global optimization. Our pipeline for volumetric reconstruction fuses dense keyframes at a centralized server via 5G connectivity, aggregating geometry, and occupancy information from multiple autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) without overtaxing onboard resources. This enables each AMR to independently perform mapping while the backend constructs high-fidelity 3D maps in real time. To overcome the limitation of standard visual nodes we automate a 4D mmWave radar, standalone from CRADMap, to test its capabilities for making extra maps of the hidden metallic object(s) in a cluttered environment. Experimental results Section-IV confirm that our framework yields globally consistent volumetric reconstructions and seamlessly supports applied distributed mapping in complex indoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, IEEE</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we introduce an intelligent robotic automation system designed to address this issue. By employing a patented technique that temporarily stiffens garments, we eliminate the traditional necessity for fabric modeling. Our methodological approach is rooted in a meticulously designed three-stage pipeline: first, an accurate pose estimation of the cut fabric pieces; second, a procedure to temporarily join fabric pieces; and third, a closed-loop visual servoing technique for the sewing process. Demonstrating versatility across various fabric types, our approach has been successfully validated in practical settings, notably with cotton material at the Bluewater Defense production line and denim material at Levi's research facility. The techniques described in this paper integrate robotic mechanisms with traditional sewing machines, devising a real-time sewing algorithm, and providing hands-on validation through a collaborative robot setup.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving a good balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness remains a challenge. For instance, CNNs are computationally efficient but struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs excel in capturing such dependencies but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper proposes two ViT-based models for accurate, efficient, and robust 2D pose estimation. The first one, EViTPose, operates in a computationally efficient manner without sacrificing accuracy by utilizing learnable joint tokens to select and process a subset of the most important body patches, enabling us to control the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency by changing the number of patches to be processed. The second one, UniTransPose, while not allowing for the same level of direct control over the trade-off, efficiently handles multiple scales by combining (1) an efficient multi-scale transformer encoder that uses both local and global attention with (2) an efficient sub-pixel CNN decoder for better speed and accuracy. Moreover, by incorporating all joints from different benchmarks into a unified skeletal representation, we train robust methods that learn from multiple datasets simultaneously and perform well across a range of scenarios -- including pose variations, lighting conditions, and occlusions. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods while improving computational efficiency. EViTPose exhibits a significant decrease in computational complexity (30% to 44% less in GFLOPs) with a minimal drop of accuracy (0% to 3.5% less), and UniTransPose achieves accuracy improvements ranging from 0.9% to 43.8% across these benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we explore their potential for localization within pre-existing LiDAR maps, a critical task for applications that require precise navigation and mobile manipulation. Our framework follows a paradigm based on the refinement of an initial pose. Specifically, we first project LiDAR points into 2D space based on a rough initial pose to obtain depth maps, and then employ an optical flow estimation network to align events with LiDAR points in 2D space, followed by camera pose estimation using a PnP solver. To enhance geometric consistency between these two inherently different modalities, we develop a novel frame-based event representation that improves structural clarity. Additionally, given the varying degrees of bias observed in the ground truth poses, we design a module that predicts an auxiliary variable as a regularization term to mitigate the impact of this bias on network convergence. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. To facilitate future research, both the code and the pre-trained models are made available online.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional GNSS-based localization methods suffer from signal occlusion and multipath effects in urban environments. Meanwhile, methods relying on high-definition (HD) maps are constrained by the high costs associated with the construction and maintenance of HD maps. Standard-definition (SD) maps-based methods, on the other hand, often exhibit unsatisfactory performance or poor generalization ability due to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose SegLocNet, a multimodal GNSS-free localization network that achieves precise localization using bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation. SegLocNet employs a BEV segmentation network to generate semantic maps from multiple sensor inputs, followed by an exhaustive matching process to estimate the vehicle's ego pose. This approach avoids the limitations of regression-based pose estimation and maintains high interpretability and generalization. By introducing a unified map representation, our method can be applied to both HD and SD maps without any modifications to the network architecture, thereby balancing localization accuracy and area coverage. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and that our method can accurately estimate the ego pose in urban environments without relying on GNSS, while maintaining strong generalization ability. Our code and pre-trained model will be released publicly.</p></details> |  | None |

These segmented frames are then processed by two existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain player skeletal joints, and the other for shuttlecock trajectory detection to extract shuttlecock trajectories. Leveraging these joints, trajectories, and player positions as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset, ShuttleSet, which shows that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is likely to be a trend for racket sports action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pag...8 pages (excluding references).

In this study, we propose a Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for person identification using upper body keypoints visible during online conversations, which we term conversational keypoints. Our framework processes both spatial relationships between keypoints and their temporal evolution through two specialized branches: a Spatial Transformer (STR) that learns distinctive structural patterns in keypoint configurations, and a Temporal Transformer (TTR) that captures sequential motion patterns. Using the state-of-the-art Sapiens pose estimator, we extract 133 keypoints (based on COCO-WholeBody format) representing facial features, head pose, and hand positions. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 114 individuals engaged in natural conversations, achieving recognition accuracies of 80.12% for the spatial stream, 63.61% for the temporal stream. We then explored two fusion strategies: a shared loss function approach achieving 82.22% accuracy, and a feature-level fusion method that concatenates feature maps from both streams, significantly improving performance to 94.86%. By jointly modeling both static anatomical relationships and dynamic movement patterns, our approach learns comprehensive identity signatures that are more robust to spoofing than traditional appearance-based methods.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

Achieving real-time SLAM on mobile robotic systems with limited computational resources is challenging because the complexity of SLAM algorithms increases over time. This restriction can be lifted by offloading computations to edge servers, forming the emerging paradigm of edge-assisted SLAM. Nevertheless, the exogenous and stochastic input processes affect the dynamics of the edge-assisted SLAM system. Moreover, the requirements of clients on SLAM metrics change over time, exerting implicit and time-varying effects on the system. In this paper, we aim to push the limit beyond existing edge-assist SLAM by proposing a new architecture that can handle the input-driven processes and also satisfy clients' implicit and time-varying requirements. The key innovations of our work involve a regional feature prediction method for importance-aware local data processing, a configuration adaptation policy that integrates data compression/decompression and task offloading, and an input-dependent learning framework for task scheduling with constraint satisfaction. Extensive experiments prove that our architecture improves pose estimation accuracy and saves up to 47% of communication costs compared with a popular edge-assisted SLAM system, as well as effectively satisfies the clients' requirements.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

However, their inherent fragility and vulnerability to various threats render them susceptible to significant damage and destruction. The application of advanced 3D reconstruction technologies for high-quality modeling is crucial for preserving them. These technologies help scientists to accurately document and monitor the state of coral reefs, including their structure, species distribution and changes over time. Photogrammetry-based approaches stand out among existing solutions, especially with recent advancements in underwater videography, photogrammetric computer vision, and machine learning. Despite continuous progress in image-based 3D reconstruction techniques, there remains a lack of systematic reviews and comprehensive evaluations of cutting-edge solutions specifically applied to underwater coral reef images. The emerging advanced methods may have difficulty coping with underwater imaging environments, complex coral structures, and computational resource constraints. They need to be reviewed and evaluated to bridge the gap between many cutting-edge technical studies and practical applications. This paper focuses on the two critical stages of these approaches: camera pose estimation and dense surface reconstruction. We systematically review and summarize classical and emerging methods, conducting comprehensive evaluations through real-world and simulated datasets. Based on our findings, we offer reference recommendations and discuss the development potential and challenges of existing approaches in depth. This work equips scientists and managers with a technical foundation and practical guidance for processing underwater coral reef images for 3D reconstruction....</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

However, MVO systems face the common issue of lacking inherent scale information from monocular cameras. Traditional methods have good interpretability but can only obtain relative scale and suffer from severe scale drift in long-distance tasks. Learning-based methods under perspective view leverage large amounts of training data to acquire prior knowledge and estimate absolute scale by predicting depth values. However, their generalization ability is limited due to the need to accurately estimate the depth of each point. In contrast, we propose a novel MVO system called BEV-DWPVO. Our approach leverages the common assumption of a ground plane, using Bird's-Eye View (BEV) feature maps to represent the environment in a grid-based structure with a unified scale. This enables us to reduce the complexity of pose estimation from 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) to 3-DoF. Keypoints are extracted and matched within the BEV space, followed by pose estimation through a differentiable weighted Procrustes solver. The entire system is fully differentiable, supporting end-to-end training with only pose supervision and no auxiliary tasks. We validate BEV-DWPVO on the challenging long-sequence datasets NCLT, Oxford, and KITTI, achieving superior results over existing MVO methods on most evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

Our comprehensive evaluation of 14 methods reveals that while recent detector-free approaches achieve the best performance (>47% success rate), they come with significant computational overhead compared to detector-based methods (150-600ms vs. 40-70ms). Even the best performing method succeeds on only 54.8% of the pairs, highlighting substantial room for improvement, particularly in challenging scenarios combining low overlap, large scale differences, and extreme viewpoint changes.

The emergence of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies has heightened the demand for real-time performance in these applications. However, current state-of-the-art models often exhibit promising results at the expense of substantial computational overhead. In this paper, we present a query-optimized real-time Transformer (QORT-Former), the first Transformer-based real-time framework for 3D pose estimation of two hands and an object. We first limit the number of queries and decoders to meet the efficiency requirement. Given limited number of queries and decoders, we propose to optimize queries which are taken as input to the Transformer decoder, to secure better accuracy: (1) we propose to divide queries into three types (a left hand query, a right hand query and an object query) and enhance query features (2) by using the contact information between hands and an object and (3) by using three-step update of enhanced image and query features with respect to one another. With proposed methods, we achieved real-time pose estimation performance using just 108 queries and 1 decoder (53.5 FPS on an RTX 3090TI GPU). Surpassing state-of-the-art results on the H2O dataset by 17.6% (left hand), 22.8% (right hand), and 27.2% (object), as well as on the FPHA dataset by 5.3% (right hand) and 10.4% (object), our method excels in accuracy.

However, the field of view and spatial resolution of the camera limit pose estimation accuracy. This paper designs a divergent multi-aperture imaging system (DMAIS), equivalent to a single imaging system to achieve simultaneous observation of a large field of view and high spatial resolution. The DMAIS overcomes traditional observation limitations, allowing accurate pose estimation for the flight platform. {Before conducting pose estimation, the DMAIS must be calibrated. To this end we propose a calibration method for DMAIS based on the 3D calibration field.} The calibration process determines the imaging parameters of the DMAIS, which allows us to model DMAIS as a generalized camera. Subsequently, a new algorithm for accurately determining the pose of flight platform is introduced. We transform the absolute pose estimation problem into a nonlinear minimization problem. New optimality conditions are established for solving this problem based on Lagrange multipliers. Finally, real calibration experiments show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. Results from real flight experiments validate the system's ability to achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy and arc-minute-level orientation accuracy.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

Compared with pose estimation based on point correspondences or its robust versions, correspondence-free methods are often more flexible. However, existing correspondence-free methods often rely on feature representation alignment or end-to-end regression. For such a purpose, a new correspondence-free pose estimation method and its practical algorithms are proposed, whose key idea is the elimination of unknowns by process of addition to separate the pose estimation from correspondence. By taking the considered point sets as patterns, feature functions used to describe these patterns are introduced to establish a sufficient number of equations for optimization. The proposed method is applicable to nonlinear transformations such as perspective projection and can cover various pose estimations from 3D-to-3D points, 3D-to-2D points, and 2D-to-2D points. Experimental results on both simulation and actual data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information.

However, existing Transformer-based 3D HPE backbones often encounter a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. To resolve the above dilemma, in this work, we leverage recent advances in state space models and utilize Mamba for high-quality and efficient long-range modeling. Nonetheless, Mamba still faces challenges in precisely exploiting local dependencies between joints. To address these issues, we propose a new attention-free hybrid spatiotemporal architecture named Hybrid Mamba-GCN (Pose Magic). This architecture introduces local enhancement with GCN by capturing relationships between neighboring joints, thus producing new representations to complement Mamba's outputs. By adaptively fusing representations from Mamba and GCN, Pose Magic demonstrates superior capability in learning the underlying 3D structure. To meet the requirements of real-time inference, we also provide a fully causal version. Extensive experiments show that Pose Magic achieves new SOTA results ($\downarrow 0.9 mm$) while saving $74.1\%$ FLOPs. In addition, Pose Magic exhibits optimal motion consistency and the ability to generalize to unseen sequence lengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This ...This work has been accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](None) |

We argue that the increasing miniaturization of optical sensors will lead to the prolific integration of cameras into many more body-worn devices at various locations. This will bring fresh perspectives to established tasks in computer vision and benefit key areas such as human motion tracking, body pose estimation, or action recognition -- particularly for the lower body, which is typically occluded. In this paper, we introduce EgoSim, a novel simulator of body-worn cameras that generates realistic egocentric renderings from multiple perspectives across a wearer's body. A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion capture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with arm- or leg-worn cameras. In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of egocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D poses during several activities: 119 hours of data are derived from AMASS motion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment with 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro cameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit. We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D pose estimation network. Analyzing its domain gap, we show that our dataset and simulator substantially aid training for inference on real-world data.

However, existing studies are at their preliminary research stage, which focus on addressing the problem for only a few specific mammal species. In principle, from specific to general mammal pose estimation, the biggest issue is how to address the huge appearance and pose variances for different species. We argue that given appearance context, instance-level prior and the structural relation among keypoints can serve as complementary evidence. To this end, we propose a Keypoint Interactive Transformer (KIT) to learn instance-level structure-supporting dependencies for general mammal pose estimation. Specifically, our KITPose consists of two coupled components. The first component is to extract keypoint features and generate body part prompts. The features are supervised by a dedicated generalised heatmap regression loss (GHRL). Instead of introducing external visual/text prompts, we devise keypoints clustering to generate body part biases, aligning them with image context to generate corresponding instance-level prompts. Second, we propose a novel interactive transformer that takes feature slices as input tokens without performing spatial splitting. In addition, to enhance the capability of the KIT model, we design an adaptive weight strategy to address the imbalance issue among different keypoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accep...accepted by IJCV 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](None) |

The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

However, occlusions from plant foliage often hinder accurate shape and pose estimation. Therefore, we propose an active fruit shape and pose estimation method that physically manipulates occluding leaves to reveal hidden fruits. This paper introduces a framework that plans robot actions to maximize visibility and minimize leaf damage. We developed a novel scene-consistent shape completion technique to improve fruit estimation under heavy occlusion and utilize a perception-driven deformation graph model to predict leaf deformation during planning. Experiments on artificial and real sweet pepper plants demonstrate that our method enables robots to safely move leaves aside, exposing fruits for accurate shape and pose estimation, outperforming baseline methods.

To predict a single output 3D pose sequence, we generate and aggregate multiple 3D pose hypotheses. For better aggregation results, we develop a method to score these hypotheses during training, effectively integrating conformal prediction into the learning process. This process results in a differentiable conformal predictor that is trained end2end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned scoring model is used as the conformity score, and the 3D pose estimator is combined with a conformal predictor to select the most accurate hypotheses for downstream aggregation. Our results indicate that using a simple mean aggregation on the conformal prediction-filtered hypotheses set yields competitive results. When integrated with more sophisticated aggregation techniques, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

However, in real-world scenarios, issues such as occlusion, noise interference, and missing viewpoints can severely affect pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce the task of Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation. Traditional 3D pose estimation methods often rely on multi-stage networks and modular combinations, which can lead to cumulative errors and increased training complexity, making them unable to effectively address deficiency-aware estimation. To this end, we propose DeProPose, a flexible method that simplifies the network architecture to reduce training complexity and avoid information loss in multi-stage designs. Additionally, the model innovatively introduces a multi-view feature fusion mechanism based on relative projection error, which effectively utilizes information from multiple viewpoints and dynamically assigns weights, enabling efficient integration and enhanced robustness to overcome deficiency-aware 3D Pose Estimation challenges. Furthermore, to thoroughly evaluate this end-to-end multi-view 3D human pose estimation model and to advance research on occlusion-related challenges, we have developed a novel 3D human pose estimation dataset, termed the Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation (DA-3DPE) dataset. This dataset encompasses a wide range of deficiency scenarios, including noise interference, missing viewpoints, and occlusion challenges. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DeProPose not only excels in addressing the deficiency-aware problem but also shows improvement in conventional scenarios, providing a powerful and user-friendly solution for 3D human pose estimation.

However, previous GS-based methods primarily target indoor scenes and rely on RGB-D sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, hence underperforming in outdoor scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a RGB-only gaussian splatting SLAM method for unbounded outdoor scenes--OpenGS-SLAM. Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network to generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared to commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene geometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then, we propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous optimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing system tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper for the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap mapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8\% of previous 3DGS methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

Existing online gravity estimation methods rely on pose estimation combined with IMU measurements, which is considered best practice when direct velocity measurements are unavailable. However, with radar sensors providing direct velocity data-a measurement not yet utilized for gravity estimation-we found a significant opportunity to improve gravity estimation accuracy substantially. GaRLIO, the proposed gravity-enhanced Radar-LiDAR-Inertial Odometry, can robustly predict gravity to reduce vertical drift while simultaneously enhancing state estimation performance using pointwise velocity measurements. Furthermore, GaRLIO ensures robustness in dynamic environments by utilizing radar to remove dynamic objects from LiDAR point clouds. Our method is validated through experiments in various environments prone to vertical drift, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional LiDAR-Inertial Odometry methods.

In this paper, we consider the performance of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in tracking 3D facial motion in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We first analyze a noise-free environment where the state transition is purely deterministic, demonstrating that UKF outperforms EKF by achieving lower mean squared error (MSE) due to its ability to capture higher-order nonlinearities. However, when stochastic noise is introduced, EKF exhibits superior robustness, maintaining lower mean square error (MSE) compared to UKF, which becomes more sensitive to measurement noise and occlusions. Our results highlight that UKF is preferable for high-precision applications in controlled environments, whereas EKF is better suited for real-world scenarios with unpredictable noise. These findings provide practical insights for selecting the appropriate filtering technique in 3D facial tracking applications, such as motion capture and facial recognition.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures | [Code Link](None) |

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel and general hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior or on-par performance with state-of-the-art NeRF-based and Gaussian-based SLAM systems, while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pa...15 pages.

In this paper, we introduce the challenge of unsupervised categorical prior learning in pose estimation, where AI models learn a general pose prior for an object category from images in a self-supervised manner. Although priors are effective in estimating pose, acquiring them can be difficult. We propose a novel method, named Pose Prior Learner (PPL), to learn a general pose prior for any object category. PPL uses a hierarchical memory to store compositional parts of prototypical poses, from which we distill a general pose prior. This prior improves pose estimation accuracy through template transformation and image reconstruction. PPL learns meaningful pose priors without any additional human annotations or interventions, outperforming competitive baselines on both human and animal pose estimation datasets. Notably, our experimental results reveal the effectiveness of PPL using learned prototypical poses for pose estimation on occluded images. Through iterative inference, PPL leverages the pose prior to refine estimated poses, regressing them to any prototypical poses stored in memory. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

Despite advances improving speed and accuracy in pose estimation, finding a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy poses significant challenges in dynamic environments. Most current algorithms lack scalability in estimation time, especially for diverse datasets, and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are often too slow. This study focuses on developing a fast and scalable set of pose estimators based on GDRNPP to meet or exceed current benchmarks in accuracy and robustness, particularly addressing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off essential in real-time scenarios. We propose the AMIS algorithm to tailor the utilized model according to an application-specific trade-off between inference time and accuracy. We further show the effectiveness of the AMIS-based model choice on four prominent benchmark datasets (LM-O, YCB-V, T-LESS, and ITODD).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

In this paper, we propose a novel active illumination framework to enhance the performance of VO and V-SLAM algorithms in these challenging conditions. The developed approach dynamically controls a moving light source to illuminate highly textured areas, thereby improving feature extraction and tracking. Specifically, a detector block, which incorporates a deep learning-based enhancing network, identifies regions with relevant features. Then, a pan-tilt controller is responsible for guiding the light beam toward these areas, so that to provide information-rich images to the ego-motion estimation algorithm. Experimental results on a real robotic platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a reduction in the pose estimation error up to 75% with respect to a traditional fixed lighting technique.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

However, achieving real-time performance remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile robots and multi-robot systems due to the computational burden of high-density sampling, which increases the complexity of comparing and verifying query samples against a growing map database. Conventional methods often retain redundant information or miss critical data by relying on fixed sampling intervals or operating in 3-D space instead of the descriptor feature space. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of sample space and propose a novel keyframe sampling approach for LiDAR-based place recognition. Our method minimizes redundancy while preserving essential information in the hyper-dimensional descriptor space, supporting both learning-based and handcrafted descriptors. The proposed approach incorporates a sliding window optimization strategy to ensure efficient keyframe selection and real-time performance, enabling seamless integration into robotic pipelines. In sum, our approach demonstrates robust performance across diverse datasets, with the ability to adapt seamlessly from indoor to outdoor scenarios without parameter tuning, reducing loop closure detection times and memory requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pa...20 pages, 17 figures, 6 tables.

We begin by systematically assessing their ability to learn 3D equivariant features, specifically examining the consistency of semantic embeddings across different viewpoints. Our findings indicate that improved 3D equivariance leads to better performance on various downstream tasks, including pose estimation, tracking, and semantic transfer. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective finetuning strategy based on 3D correspondences, which significantly enhances the 3D correspondence understanding of existing vision models.

However, unreliable localization results of invisible keypoints degrade the quality of correspondences. In this paper, we address this issue by localizing the important keypoints in terms of visibility. Since keypoint visibility information is currently missing in the dataset collection process, we propose an efficient way to generate binary visibility labels from available object-level annotations, for keypoints of both asymmetric objects and symmetric objects. We further derive real-valued visibility-aware importance from binary labels based on the PageRank algorithm. Taking advantage of the flexibility of our visibility-aware importance, we construct VAPO (Visibility-Aware POse estimator) by integrating the visibility-aware importance with a state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithm, along with additional positional encoding. VAPO can work in both CAD-based and CAD-free settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular pose estimation benchmarks including Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-V, demonstrating that VAPO clearly achieves state-of-the-art performances.

Though existing methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often exhibit limitations due to constrained dataset diversity and the restricted amount of information derived from audio inputs. To address these challenges, we present VarGes, a novel variation-driven framework designed to enhance co-speech gesture generation by integrating visual stylistic cues while maintaining naturalness. Our approach begins with the Variation-Enhanced Feature Extraction (VEFE) module, which seamlessly incorporates \textcolor{blue}{style-reference} video data into a 3D human pose estimation network to extract StyleCLIPS, thereby enriching the input with stylistic information. Subsequently, we employ the Variation-Compensation Style Encoder (VCSE), a transformer-style encoder equipped with an additive attention mechanism pooling layer, to robustly encode diverse StyleCLIPS representations and effectively manage stylistic variations. Finally, the Variation-Driven Gesture Predictor (VDGP) module fuses MFCC audio features with StyleCLIPS encodings via cross-attention, injecting this fused data into a cross-conditional autoregressive model to modulate 3D human gesture generation based on audio input and stylistic clues. The efficacy of our approach is validated on benchmark datasets, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of gesture diversity and naturalness.

Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | [Code Link](None) |

However, existing representation learning methods often encounter the following issues: the high semantic level of features extracted from images is inadequate for regressing low-level information, and the extracted features include task-irrelevant information, reducing their compactness and interfering with regression tasks. To address these challenges, we propose TI-Net, a highly versatile visual Network backbone designed to construct a Transformation Isomorphic latent space. Specifically, we employ linear transformations to model geometric transformations in the latent space and ensure that {\rm TI-Net} aligns them with those in the image space. This ensures that the latent features capture compact, low-level information beneficial for pose estimation tasks. We evaluated TI-Net on the hand pose estimation task to demonstrate the network's superiority. On the DexYCB dataset, TI-Net achieved a 10% improvement in the PA-MPJPE metric compared to specialized state-of-the-art (SOTA) hand pose estimation methods.

However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

While significant advancements have been made in pose estimation for humans and animals, it is still a challenge in surgical robotics due to the scarcity of published data. The relatively large absolute error of the da Vinci end effector kinematics and arduous calibration procedure make calibrated kinematics data collection expensive. Driven by this limitation, we collected a dataset, dubbed SurgPose, providing instance-aware semantic keypoints and skeletons for visual surgical tool pose estimation and tracking. By marking keypoints using ultraviolet (UV) reactive paint, which is invisible under white light and fluorescent under UV light, we execute the same trajectory under different lighting conditions to collect raw videos and keypoint annotations, respectively. The SurgPose dataset consists of approximately 120k surgical instrument instances (80k for training and 40k for validation) of 6 categories. Each instrument instance is labeled with 7 semantic keypoints. Since the videos are collected in stereo pairs, the 2D pose can be lifted to 3D based on stereo-matching depth. In addition to releasing the dataset, we test a few baseline approaches to surgical instrument tracking to demonstrate the utility of SurgPose.

However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

In this work, we re-evaluate the necessity of additional modules and analyze how to improve training efficiency and reduce redundant steps in the inference process. Based on these insights, we propose CatVTON, a simple and efficient virtual try-on diffusion model that transfers in-shop or worn garments of arbitrary categories to target individuals by concatenating them along spatial dimensions as inputs of the diffusion model. The efficiency of CatVTON is reflected in three aspects: (1) Lightweight network. CatVTON consists only of a VAE and a simplified denoising UNet, removing redundant image and text encoders as well as cross-attentions, and includes just 899.06M parameters. (2) Parameter-efficient training. Through experimental analysis, we identify self-attention modules as crucial for adapting pre-trained diffusion models to the virtual try-on task, enabling high-quality results with only 49.57M training parameters. (3) Simplified inference. CatVTON eliminates unnecessary preprocessing, such as pose estimation, human parsing, and captioning, requiring only a person image and garment reference to guide the virtual try-on process, reducing over 49% memory usage compared to other diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CatVTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results compared to baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalization performance in in-the-wild scenarios, despite being trained solely on public datasets with 73K samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accep...Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](None) |

For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures | [Code Link](None) |

Most state-of-the-art methods adopt optical flow or temporal difference, learning local visual content correspondence across frames at the pixel level, to capture motion dynamics. However, such a paradigm essentially relies on localized pixel-to-pixel similarity, which neglects the semantical correlations among frames and is vulnerable to image quality degradations (e.g. occlusions or blur). Moreover, existing approaches often combine motion and spatial (appearance) features via simple concatenation or summation, leading to practical challenges in fully leveraging these distinct modalities. In this paper, we present a novel framework that learns multi-level semantical dynamics and dense spatio-temporal collaboration for multi-frame human pose estimation. Specifically, we first design a Multi-Level Semantic Motion Encoder using a multi-masked context and pose reconstruction strategy. This strategy stimulates the model to explore multi-granularity spatiotemporal semantic relationships among frames by progressively masking the features of (patch) cubes and frames. We further introduce a Spatial-Motion Mutual Learning module which densely propagates and consolidates context information from spatial and motion features to enhance the capability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets new state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, PoseTrack2017, PoseTrack2018, and PoseTrack21.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

While existing methods can estimate the precise 6D pose of objects, they heavily rely on curated CAD models or reference images, the preparation of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, 3D models or reference images may not be available in advance and instant robot reaction is desired. In this work, we propose a novel framework named HIPPo, which eliminates the need for curated CAD models and reference images by harnessing image-to-3D priors from Diffusion Models, enabling model-free zero-shot 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we construct HIPPo Dreamer, a rapid image-to-mesh model built on a multiview Diffusion Model and a 3D reconstruction foundation model. Our HIPPo Dreamer can generate a 3D mesh of any unseen objects from a single glance in just a few seconds. Then, as more observations are acquired, we propose to continuously refine the diffusion prior mesh model by joint optimization of object geometry and appearance. This is achieved by a measurement-guided scheme that gradually replaces the plausible diffusion priors with more reliable online observations. Consequently, HIPPo can instantly estimate and track the 6D pose of a novel object and maintain a complete mesh for immediate robotic applications. Thorough experiments on various benchmarks show that HIPPo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 6D object pose estimation when prior reference images are limited.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

However, their high cost limits their widespread adoption. On the other hand, monocular localization in LiDAR maps using inexpensive cameras is a cost-effective alternative for large-scale deployment. Nevertheless, most existing approaches struggle to generalize to new sensor setups and environments, requiring retraining or fine-tuning. In this paper, we present CMRNext, a novel approach for camera-LIDAR matching that is independent of sensor-specific parameters, generalizable, and can be used in the wild for monocular localization in LiDAR maps and camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration. CMRNext exploits recent advances in deep neural networks for matching cross-modal data and standard geometric techniques for robust pose estimation. We reformulate the point-pixel matching problem as an optical flow estimation problem and solve the Perspective-n-Point problem based on the resulting correspondences to find the relative pose between the camera and the LiDAR point cloud. We extensively evaluate CMRNext on six different robotic platforms, including three publicly available datasets and three in-house robots. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMRNext outperforms existing approaches on both tasks and effectively generalizes to previously unseen environments and sensor setups in a zero-shot manner. We make the code and pre-trained models publicly available at http://cmrnext.cs.uni-freiburg.de .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accep...Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](None) |

These systems, including LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), often face challenges in localization due to adverse environmental conditions such as dust, smoke, and limited visual features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel head-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset with ground truth, aimed at advancing data-driven IMU pose estimation. Our dataset captures human head motion patterns using a helmet-mounted system, with data from ten participants performing various activities. We explore the application of neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to correct IMU biases and improve localization accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of these methods across different IMU data window dimensions, motion patterns, and sensor types. We release a publicly available dataset, demonstrate the feasibility of advanced neural network approaches for helmet-based localization, and provide evaluation metrics to establish a baseline for future studies in this field.

For robots, however, this capability remains a substantial challenge, as they cannot interpret abstract instructions and translate them into executable actions. In this paper, we present Manual2Skill, a novel framework that enables robots to perform complex assembly tasks guided by high-level manual instructions. Our approach leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract structured information from instructional images and then uses this information to construct hierarchical assembly graphs. These graphs represent parts, subassemblies, and the relationships between them. To facilitate task execution, a pose estimation model predicts the relative 6D poses of components at each assembly step. At the same time, a motion planning module generates actionable sequences for real-world robotic implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Manual2Skill by successfully assembling several real-world IKEA furniture items. This application highlights its ability to manage long-horizon manipulation tasks with both efficiency and precision, significantly enhancing the practicality of robot learning from instruction manuals. This work marks a step forward in advancing robotic systems capable of understanding and executing complex manipulation tasks in a manner akin to human capabilities.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

A key step to enable these experiences is the XR headset sensing and estimating the user's pose in order to accurately place and render virtual content in the real world. XR headsets use multiple sensors (e.g., cameras, inertial measurement unit) to perform pose estimation and improve its robustness, but this provides an attack surface for adversaries to interfere with the pose estimation process. In this paper, we create and study the effects of acoustic attacks that create false signals in the inertial measurement unit (IMU) on XR headsets, leading to adverse downstream effects on XR applications. We generate resonant acoustic signals on a HoloLens 2 and measure the resulting perturbations in the IMU readings, and also demonstrate both fine-grained and coarse attacks on the popular ORB-SLAM3 and an open-source XR system (ILLIXR). With the knowledge gleaned from attacking these open-source frameworks, we demonstrate four end-to-end proof-of-concept attacks on a HoloLens 2: manipulating user input, clickjacking, zone invasion, and denial of user interaction. Our experiments show that current commercial XR headsets are susceptible to acoustic attacks, raising concerns for their security.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |
| **[Metamorphic Testing for Pose Estimation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09460v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ShowPose estimation systems are used in a variety of fields, from sports analytics to livestock care. Given their potential impact, it is paramount to systematically test their behaviour and potential for failure. This is a complex task due to the oracle problem and the high cost of manual labelling necessary to build ground truth keypoints. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that different applications require systems to focus on different subjects (e.g., human versus animal) or landmarks (e.g., only extremities versus whole body and face), which makes labelled test data rarely reusable. To combat these problems we propose MET-POSE, a metamorphic testing framework for pose estimation systems that bypasses the need for manual annotation while assessing the performance of these systems under different circumstances. MET-POSE thus allows users of pose estimation systems to assess the systems in conditions that more closely relate to their application without having to label an ad-hoc test dataset or rely only on available datasets, which may not be adapted to their application domain. While we define MET-POSE in general terms, we also present a non-exhaustive list of metamorphic rules that represent common challenges in computer vision applications, as well as a specific way to evaluate these rules. We then experimentally show the effectiveness of MET-POSE by applying it to Mediapipe Holistic, a state of the art human pose estimation system, with the FLIC and PHOENIX datasets. With these experiments, we outline numerous ways in which the outputs of MET-POSE can uncover faults in pose estimation systems at a similar or higher rate than classic testing using hand labelled data, and show that users can tailor the rule set they use to the faults and level of accuracy relevant to their application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accep...Accepted for publication at 2025 IEEE Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST)</p></details> | [Code Link](None) |

A common approach to bridge the cross-view domain gap for pose estimation is Bird's-Eye View (BEV) synthesis. However, existing methods struggle with height ambiguity due to the lack of depth information in ground images and satellite height maps. Previous solutions either assume a flat ground plane or rely on complex models, such as cross-view transformers. We propose BevSplat, a novel method that resolves height ambiguity by using feature-based Gaussian primitives. Each pixel in the ground image is represented by a 3D Gaussian with semantic and spatial features, which are synthesized into a BEV feature map for relative pose estimation. Additionally, to address challenges with panoramic query images, we introduce an icosphere-based supervision strategy for the Gaussian primitives. We validate our method on the widely used KITTI and VIGOR datasets, which include both pinhole and panoramic query images. Experimental results show that BevSplat significantly improves localization accuracy over prior approaches.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |
| **[Boosting Semi-Supervised 2D Human Pose Estimation by Revisiting Data Augmentation and Consistency Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11566v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ShowThe 2D human pose estimation (HPE) is a basic visual problem. However, its supervised learning requires massive keypoint labels, which is labor-intensive to collect. Thus, we aim at boosting a pose estimator by excavating extra unlabeled data with semi-supervised learning (SSL). Most previous SSHPE methods are consistency-based and strive to maintain consistent outputs for differently augmented inputs. Under this genre, we find that SSHPE can be boosted from two cores: advanced data augmentations and concise consistency training ways. Specifically, for the first core, we discover the synergistic effects of existing augmentations, and reveal novel paradigms for conveniently producing new superior HPE-oriented augmentations which can more effectively add noise on unlabeled samples. We can therefore establish paired easy-hard augmentations with larger difficulty gaps. For the second core, we propose to repeatedly augment unlabeled images with diverse hard augmentations, and generate multi-path predictions sequentially for optimizing multi-losses in a single network. This simple and compact design is interpretable, and easily benefits from newly found augmentations. Comparing to state-of-the-art SSL approaches, our method brings substantial improvements on public datasets. And we extensively validate the superiority and versatility of our approach on conventional human body images, overhead fisheye images, and human hand images.

Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities with an average success rate of 90\% in four real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

| **[Semi-Supervised Unconstrained Head Pose Estimation in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02544v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ShowExisting research on unconstrained in-the-wild head pose estimation suffers from the flaws of its datasets, which consist of either numerous samples by non-realistic synthesis or constrained collection, or small-scale natural images yet with plausible manual annotations. This makes fully-supervised solutions compromised due to the reliance on generous labels. To alleviate it, we propose the first semi-supervised unconstrained head pose estimation method SemiUHPE, which can leverage abundant easily available unlabeled head images. Technically, we choose semi-supervised rotation regression and adapt it to the error-sensitive and label-scarce problem of unconstrained head pose. Our method is based on the observation that the aspect-ratio invariant cropping of wild heads is superior to previous landmark-based affine alignment given that landmarks of unconstrained human heads are usually unavailable, especially for underexplored non-frontal heads. Instead of using a pre-fixed threshold to filter out pseudo labeled heads, we propose dynamic entropy based filtering to adaptively remove unlabeled outliers as training progresses by updating the threshold in multiple stages. We then revisit the design of weak-strong augmentations and improve it by devising two novel head-oriented strong augmentations, termed pose-irrelevant cut-occlusion and pose-altering rotation consistency respectively. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that SemiUHPE outperforms its counterparts greatly on public benchmarks under both the front-range and full-range settings. Furthermore, our proposed method is also beneficial for solving other closely related problems, including generic object rotation regression and 3D head reconstruction, demonstrating good versatility and extensibility.

It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms.

By observing a user's arm movements, robots can respond appropriately, whether it's providing assistance or avoiding collisions. While visual perception offers potential for human pose estimation, it can be hindered by factors like poor lighting or occlusions. Additionally, wearable inertial sensors, though useful, require frequent calibration as they do not provide absolute position information. Force-myography (FMG) is an alternative approach where muscle perturbations are externally measured. It has been used to observe finger movements, but its application to full arm state estimation is unexplored. In this letter, we investigate the use of a wearable FMG device that can observe the state of the human arm for real-time applications of HRI. We propose a Transformer-based model to map FMG measurements from the shoulder of the user to the physical pose of the arm. The model is also shown to be transferable to other users with limited decline in accuracy.

Recently, a deep neural network with a transformer architecture has been successfully trained to estimate the pose of a UAV relative to the flight deck of a research vessel, overcoming several limitations of GPS-based approaches. However, validating the deep pose estimation scheme in an actual ocean environment poses significant challenges due to the limited availability of research vessels and the associated operational costs. To address these issues, we present a photo-realistic 3D virtual environment leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian splatting, a novel technique that represents 3D scenes by modeling image pixels as Gaussian distributions in 3D space, creating a lightweight and high-quality visual model from multiple viewpoints. This approach enables the creation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images collected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of flight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and the deep monocular pose estimation scheme.

State-of-the-art literature begins with a 3D human pose, from monocular or multiple views, and uses this representation to ground the person within a 3D world space. While standard metrics for accuracy capture joint position errors, they do not consider physical plausibility of the 3D pose. This limitation has motivated researchers to propose other metrics evaluating jitter, floor penetration, and unbalanced postures. Yet, these approaches measure independent instances of errors and are not representative of balance or stability during motion. In this work, we propose measuring physical plausibility from within physics simulation. We introduce two metrics to capture the physical plausibility and stability of predicted 3D poses from any 3D Human Pose Estimation model. Using physics simulation, we discover correlations with existing plausibility metrics and measuring stability during motion. We evaluate and compare the performances of two state-of-the-art methods, a multi-view triangulated baseline, and ground truth 3D markers from the Human3.6m dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to BMVC2024 | [Code Link](None) |

With a robust and accurate tracking system on surgical videos, the motion dynamics and movement patterns of the hands can be captured and analyzed for many rich tasks. In this work, we propose a novel hand pose estimation model, CondPose, which improves detection and tracking accuracy by incorporating a pose prior into its prediction. We show improvements over state-of-the-art methods which provide frame-wise independent predictions, by following a temporally guided approach that effectively leverages past predictions. We collect Surgical Hands, the first dataset that provides multi-instance articulated hand pose annotations for videos. Our dataset provides over 8.1k annotated hand poses from publicly available surgical videos and bounding boxes, pose annotations, and tracking IDs to enable multi-instance tracking. When evaluated on Surgical Hands, we show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach using mean Average Precision (mAP), to measure pose estimation accuracy, and Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), to assess pose tracking performance. In comparison to a frame-wise independent strategy, we show greater performance in detecting and tracking hand poses and more substantial impact on localization accuracy.

Recent approaches leverage foundational features to capture semantic and geometry cues from data. However, these approaches fail under partial visibility. We overcome this with a first-complete-then-aggregate strategy for feature extraction utilizing class priors. In this paper, we present GCE-Pose, a method that enhances pose estimation for novel instances by integrating category-level global context prior. GCE-Pose performs semantic shape reconstruction with a proposed Semantic Shape Reconstruction (SSR) module. Given an unseen partial RGB-D object instance, our SSR module reconstructs the instance's global geometry and semantics by deforming category-specific 3D semantic prototypes through a learned deep Linear Shape Model. We further introduce a Global Context Enhanced (GCE) feature fusion module that effectively fuses features from partial RGB-D observations and the reconstructed global context. Extensive experiments validate the impact of our global context prior and the effectiveness of the GCE fusion module, demonstrating that GCE-Pose significantly outperforms existing methods on challenging real-world datasets HouseCat6D and NOCS-REAL275.

Bridging this gap is vital for robotics and computer vision but challenging due to the sparse, unstructured nature of 3D LiDAR data and 2D-focused fiducial marker designs. This dissertation proposes a novel framework for mapping and localization using LFMs is proposed to benefit a variety of real-world applications, including the collection of 3D assets and training data for point cloud registration, 3D map merging, Augmented Reality (AR), and many more. First, an Intensity Image-based LiDAR Fiducial Marker (IFM) system is introduced, using thin, letter-sized markers compatible with VFMs. A detection method locates 3D fiducials from intensity images, enabling LiDAR pose estimation. Second, an enhanced algorithm extends detection to 3D maps, increasing marker range and facilitating tasks like 3D map merging. This method leverages both intensity and geometry, overcoming limitations of geometry-only detection approaches. Third, a new LFM-based mapping and localization method registers unordered, low-overlap point clouds. It employs adaptive threshold detection and a two-level graph framework to solve a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem, optimizing point cloud and marker poses. Additionally, the Livox-3DMatch dataset is introduced, improving learning-based multiview point cloud registration methods. Extensive experiments with various LiDAR models in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | PhD thesis | [Code Link](None) |
| **[Diff9D: Diffusion-Based Domain-Generalized Category-Level 9-DoF Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02525v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ShowNine-degrees-of-freedom (9-DoF) object pose and size estimation is crucial for enabling augmented reality and robotic manipulation. Category-level methods have received extensive research attention due to their potential for generalization to intra-class unknown objects. However, these methods require manual collection and labeling of large-scale real-world training data. To address this problem, we introduce a diffusion-based paradigm for domain-generalized category-level 9-DoF object pose estimation. Our motivation is to leverage the latent generalization ability of the diffusion model to address the domain generalization challenge in object pose estimation. This entails training the model exclusively on rendered synthetic data to achieve generalization to real-world scenes. We propose an effective diffusion model to redefine 9-DoF object pose estimation from a generative perspective. Our model does not require any 3D shape priors during training or inference. By employing the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model, we demonstrate that the reverse diffusion process can be executed in as few as 3 steps, achieving near real-time performance. Finally, we design a robotic grasping system comprising both hardware and software components. Through comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and the real-world robotic system, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art domain generalization performance. Our code will be made public at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/Diff9D.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/CNJianLiu/Diff9D) |

This difficulty stems from factors such as shadows, indirect illumination, and inaccurate object-pose estimations due to occluding hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that predicts the hand's impact on environmental visibility and indirect illumination on the object's surface albedo. Our method first learns the geometry and low-fidelity texture of the object, hand, and background through composite rendering of radiance fields. Simultaneously, we optimize the hand and object poses to achieve accurate object-pose estimations. We then refine physics-based rendering parameters - including roughness, specularity, albedo, hand visibility, skin color reflections, and environmental illumination - to produce precise albedo, and accurate hand illumination and shadow regions. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in texture reconstruction and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to account for hand-object interactions in object texture reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This ...This paper was accepted at CVM 2025 and will appear in IEEE TVCG.

In this task, deep neural network-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, previous studies show they suffer from spurious correlations raised by "unclean" confounders in models, hindering their performance on novel instances with significant variations. To address this issue, we propose CleanPose, a novel approach integrating causal learning and knowledge distillation to enhance category-level pose estimation. To mitigate the negative effect of unobserved confounders, we develop a causal inference module based on front-door adjustment, which promotes unbiased estimation by reducing potential spurious correlations. Additionally, to further improve generalization ability, we devise a residual-based knowledge distillation method that has proven effective in providing comprehensive category information guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks (REAL275, CAMERA25 and HouseCat6D) hightlight the superiority of proposed CleanPose over state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Enhancing Feature Tracking Reliability for Visual Navigation using Real-Time Safety Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01092v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ShowVision sensors are extensively used for localizing a robot's pose, particularly in environments where global localization tools such as GPS or motion capture systems are unavailable. In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pag...7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA 2025)</p></details> | [Code Link](None) |

The workpieces in bin-picking are typically textureless and randomly stacked in a bin, which poses a significant challenge to 6D pose estimation. Existing solutions are typically learning-based methods, which require object-specific training. Their efficiency of practical deployment for novel workpieces is highly limited by data collection and model retraining. Zero-shot 6D pose estimation is a potential approach to address the issue of deployment efficiency. Nevertheless, existing zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods are designed to leverage feature matching to establish point-to-point correspondences for pose estimation, which is less effective for workpieces with textureless appearances and ambiguous local regions. In this paper, we propose ZeroBP, a zero-shot pose estimation framework designed specifically for the bin-picking task. ZeroBP learns Position-Aware Correspondence (PAC) between the scene instance and its CAD model, leveraging both local features and global positions to resolve the mismatch issue caused by ambiguous regions with similar shapes and appearances. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that ZeroBP outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot pose estimation methods, achieving an improvement of 9.1% in average recall of correct poses.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 | [Code Link](None) |

The main insight of this paper is that we can directly optimize the point cloud registration problem without correspondences by utilizing an algorithmically simple, yet computationally complex, semi-exhaustive search approach that is very well-suited for parallelization on modern GPUs. Our proposed algorithm, Direct Semi-Exhaustive Search (DSES), iterates over potential rotation matrices and efficiently computes the inlier-maximizing translation associated with each rotation. It then computes the optimal rigid transformation based on any desired distance metric by directly computing the error associated with each transformation candidate $\{R, t\}$. By leveraging the parallelism of modern GPUs, DSES outperforms state-of-the-art methods for partial-to-full point cloud registration on the simulated ModelNet40 benchmark and demonstrates high performance and robustness for pose estimation on a real-world robotics problem (https://youtu.be/q0q2-s2KSuA).</p></details> | IROS 2024 | [Code Link](None) |

Specifically, our CSVR consists of three branches: a generative pose prediction branch, a discriminative context matching branch, and a video generating branch. Among them, the first one encodes dynamic motion feature by utilizing Conditional-GAN to predict the human poses of future frames, and the second branch extracts static context features by contrasting positive and negative video feature and I-frame feature pairs. The third branch is designed to generate both current and future video frames, for the purpose of collaboratively improving dynamic motion features and static context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple popular video datasets.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization, which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as ActionFormer and WiFiTAD. We envision XRF V2 as a valuable resource for advancing research in human action localization, action forecasting, pose estimation, multimodal foundation models pre-training, synthetic data generation, and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pa...27 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | [Code Link](None) |

Unlike conventional grasping tasks where the object's geometry is assumed simple, we aim to achieve a "dynamic grasp" of the irregular objects, which requires continuous adjustment during the grasping process. To effectively handle irregular objects, we propose a trajectory optimization framework that comprises two phases. Firstly, in a specified time limit of 10s, initial offline trajectories are computed for a seamless motion from an initial configuration of the robot to grasp the object and deliver it to a pre-defined target location. Secondly, fast online trajectory optimization is implemented to update robot trajectories in real-time within 100 ms. This helps to mitigate pose estimation errors from the vision system. To account for model inaccuracies, disturbances, and other non-modeled effects, trajectory tracking controllers for both the robot and the gripper are implemented to execute the optimal trajectories from the proposed framework. The intensive experimental results effectively demonstrate the performance of our trajectory planning framework in both simulation and real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pag...7 pages.

Despite recent progress in data-driven models, feature correspondence learning is still limited by the lack of accurate per-pixel correspondence labels. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a new self-supervised scheme, imperative learning (IL), for training feature correspondence. It enables correspondence learning on arbitrary uninterrupted videos without any camera pose or depth labels, heralding a new era for self-supervised correspondence learning. Specifically, we formulated the problem of correspondence learning as a bilevel optimization, which takes the reprojection error from bundle adjustment as a supervisory signal for the model. To avoid large memory and computation overhead, we leverage the stationary point to effectively back-propagate the implicit gradients through bundle adjustment. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate superior performance on tasks including feature matching and pose estimation, in which we obtained an average of 30% accuracy gain over the state-of-the-art matching models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This ...This preprint corresponds to the Accepted Manuscript in European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2024</p></details> | [Code Link](None) |
| **[Toward Efficient Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation via a Canonical Domain Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16146v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ShowRecent advancements in deep learning methods have significantly improved the performance of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). However, performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source and target domains remains a major challenge to generalization, necessitating extensive data augmentation and/or fine-tuning for each specific target domain. To address this issue more efficiently, we propose a novel canonical domain approach that maps both the source and target domains into a unified canonical domain, alleviating the need for additional fine-tuning in the target domain. To construct the canonical domain, we introduce a canonicalization process to generate a novel canonical 2D-3D pose mapping that ensures 2D-3D pose consistency and simplifies 2D-3D pose patterns, enabling more efficient training of lifting networks. The canonicalization of both domains is achieved through the following steps: (1) in the source domain, the lifting network is trained within the canonical domain; (2) in the target domain, input 2D poses are canonicalized prior to inference by leveraging the properties of perspective projection and known camera intrinsics. Consequently, the trained network can be directly applied to the target domain without requiring additional fine-tuning. Experiments conducted with various lifting networks and publicly available datasets (e.g., Human3.6M, Fit3D, MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves generalization capability across datasets while using the same data volume.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures | [Code Link](None) |
| **[NanoHTNet: Nano Human Topology Network for Efficient 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15763v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ShowThe widespread application of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is limited by resource-constrained edge devices, requiring more efficient models. A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

However, 3DGS training requires a known camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Pioneering works have attempted to relax this restriction but still face difficulties when handling long sequences with complex camera trajectories. In this work, we propose Rob-GS, a robust framework to progressively estimate camera poses and optimize 3DGS for arbitrarily long video sequences. Leveraging the inherent continuity of videos, we design an adjacent pose tracking method to ensure stable pose estimation between consecutive frames. To handle arbitrarily long inputs, we adopt a "divide and conquer" scheme that adaptively splits the video sequence into several segments and optimizes them separately. Extensive experiments on the Tanks and Temples dataset and our collected real-world dataset show that our Rob-GS outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

Furthermore, existing approaches often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and overlook the complementary relationship between temporal pose heatmaps and visual features. To address these limitations, we introduce STDPose, a novel framework that enhances human pose estimation by learning spatiotemporal dynamics in sparsely-labeled videos. STDPose incorporates two key innovations: 1) A novel Dynamic-Aware Mask to capture long-range motion context, allowing for a nuanced understanding of pose changes. 2) A system for encoding and aggregating spatiotemporal representations and motion dynamics to effectively model spatiotemporal relationships, improving the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. STDPose establishes a new performance benchmark for both video pose propagation (i.e., propagating pose annotations from labeled frames to unlabeled frames) and pose estimation tasks, across three large-scale evaluation datasets. Additionally, utilizing pseudo-labels generated by pose propagation, STDPose achieves competitive performance with only 26.7% labeled data.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

Unlike existing SfM solutions that rely on costly matching and global optimization to achieve accurate 3D reconstructions, Light3R-SfM addresses this limitation through a novel latent global alignment module. This module replaces traditional global optimization with a learnable attention mechanism, effectively capturing multi-view constraints across images for robust and precise camera pose estimation. Light3R-SfM constructs a sparse scene graph via retrieval-score-guided shortest path tree to dramatically reduce memory usage and computational overhead compared to the naive approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light3R-SfM achieves competitive accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, making it ideal for 3D reconstruction tasks in real-world applications with a runtime constraint.

Previous works predominantly focused on either estimating poses(often at the instance level), or reconstructing shapes, but not both. Glissando-Net is composed of two auto-encoders that are jointly trained, one for RGB images and the other for point clouds. We embrace two key design choices in Glissando-Net to achieve a more accurate prediction of the 3D shape and pose of the object given a single RGB image as input. First, we augment the feature maps of the point cloud encoder and decoder with transformed feature maps from the image decoder, enabling effective 2D-3D interaction in both training and prediction. Second, we predict both the 3D shape and pose of the object in the decoder stage. This way, we better utilize the information in the 3D point clouds presented only in the training stage to train the network for more accurate prediction. We jointly train the two encoder-decoders for RGB and point cloud data to learn how to pass latent features to the point cloud decoder during inference. In testing, the encoder of the 3D point cloud is discarded. The design of Glissando-Net is inspired by codeSLAM. Unlike codeSLAM, which targets 3D reconstruction of scenes, we focus on pose estimation and shape reconstruction of objects, and directly predict the object pose and a pose invariant 3D reconstruction without the need of the code optimization step. Extensive experiments, involving both ablation studies and comparison with competing methods, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, and compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pa...15 pages, 13 Figures, accepted to TPAMI -- IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2024)</p></details> | [Code Link](None) |

However, accurate video pose estimation remains an open challenge. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that existing methods learn motion clues from all pixels rather than focusing on the target human body, making them easily misled and disrupted by unimportant information such as background changes or movements of other people. Additionally, while the current Transformer-based pose estimation methods has demonstrated impressive performance with global modeling, they struggle with local context perception and precise positional identification. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) We propose a bilayer Human-Keypoint Mask module that performs coarse-to-fine visual token refinement, which gradually zooms in on the target human body and keypoints while masking out unimportant figure regions. (2) We further introduce a novel deformable cross attention mechanism and a bidirectional separation strategy to adaptively aggregate spatial and temporal motion clues from constrained surrounding contexts. (3) We mathematically formulate the deformable cross attention, constraining that the model focuses solely on the regions centered at the target person body. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale benchmark datasets. A remarkable highlight is that our method achieves an 84.8 mean Average Precision (mAP) on the challenging wrist joint, which significantly outperforms the 81.5 mAP achieved by the current state-of-the-art method on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

Previous studies focus on spatio-temporal modeling through the enhancement of architecture design and optimization strategies. However, they overlook the causal relationships in the joints, leading to models that may be overly tailored and thus estimate poorly to challenging scenes. Therefore, adequate causal reasoning capability, coupled with good interpretability of model, are both indispensable and prerequisite for achieving reliable results. In this paper, we pioneer a causal perspective on pose estimation and introduce a causal-inspired multitask learning framework, consisting of two stages. \textit{In the first stage}, we try to endow the model with causal spatio-temporal modeling ability by introducing two self-supervision auxiliary tasks. Specifically, these auxiliary tasks enable the network to infer challenging keypoints based on observed keypoint information, thereby imbuing causal reasoning capabilities into the model and making it robust to challenging scenes. \textit{In the second stage}, we argue that not all feature tokens contribute equally to pose estimation. Prioritizing causal (keypoint-relevant) tokens is crucial to achieve reliable results, which could improve the interpretability of the model. To this end, we propose a Token Causal Importance Selection module to identify the causal tokens and non-causal tokens (\textit{e.g.}, background and objects). Additionally, non-causal tokens could provide potentially beneficial cues but may be redundant. We further introduce a non-causal tokens clustering module to merge the similar non-causal tokens. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures | [Code Link](None) |

However, efficient real-time map reconstruction with data streamed from multiple robots and devices remains a challenge. To that end, we propose HAMMER, a server-based collaborative Gaussian Splatting method that leverages widely available ROS communication infrastructure to generate 3D, metric-semantic maps from asynchronous robot data-streams with no prior knowledge of initial robot positions and varying on-device pose estimators. HAMMER consists of (i) a frame alignment module that transforms local SLAM poses and image data into a global frame and requires no prior relative pose knowledge, and (ii) an online module for training semantic 3DGS maps from streaming data. HAMMER handles mixed perception modes, adjusts automatically for variations in image pre-processing among different devices, and distills CLIP semantic codes into the 3D scene for open-vocabulary language queries. In our real-world experiments, HAMMER creates higher-fidelity maps (2x) compared to competing baselines and is useful for downstream tasks, such as semantic goal-conditioned navigation (e.g., ``go to the couch").

However, these bottom-facing cameras can sometimes be inconvenient and pose a risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive information, such as private body parts or personal surroundings. To mitigate these issues, we introduce EgoHand. This system provides an alternative solution by integrating millimeter-wave radar and IMUs for hand gesture recognition, thereby offering users an additional option for gesture interaction that enhances privacy protection. To accurately recognize hand gestures, we devise a two-stage skeleton-based gesture recognition scheme. In the first stage, a novel end-to-end Transformer architecture is employed to estimate the coordinates of hand joints. Subsequently, these estimated joint coordinates are utilized for gesture recognition. Extensive experiments involving 10 subjects show that EgoHand can detect hand gestures with 90.8% accuracy. Furthermore, EgoHand demonstrates robust performance across a variety of cross-domain tests, including different users, dominant hands, body postures, and scenes.</p></details> | 10 pages | [Code Link](None) |

While these approaches can build highly realistic maps, large-scale SLAM still remains a challenge because they require a large number of Gaussian images for mapping and adjacent images as keyframes for tracking. We propose a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method, VIGS SLAM, that utilizes sensor fusion of RGB-D and IMU sensors for large-scale indoor environments. To reduce the computational load of 3DGS-based tracking, we adopt an ICP-based tracking framework that combines IMU preintegration to provide a good initial guess for accurate pose estimation. Our proposed method is the first to propose that Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM can be effectively performed in large-scale environments by integrating IMU sensor measurements. This proposal not only enhances the performance of Gaussian Splatting SLAM beyond room-scale scenarios but also achieves SLAM performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in large-scale indoor environments.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | [Code Link](None) |
| **[Graph Optimality-Aware Stochastic LiDAR Bundle Adjustment with Progressive Spatial Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14565v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ShowLarge-scale LiDAR Bundle Adjustment (LBA) to refine sensor orientation and point cloud accuracy simultaneously to build the navigation map is a fundamental task in logistics and robotics. Unlike pose-graph-based methods that rely solely on pairwise relationships between LiDAR frames, LBA leverages raw LiDAR correspondences to achieve more precise results, especially when initial pose estimates are unreliable for low-cost sensors. However, existing LBA methods face challenges such as simplistic planar correspondences, extensive observations, and dense normal matrices in the least-squares problem, which limit robustness, efficiency, and scalability. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization scheme with Progressive Spatial Smoothing, namely PSS-GOSO, to achieve \textit{robust}, \textit{efficient}, and \textit{scalable} LBA. The Progressive Spatial Smoothing (PSS) module extracts \textit{robust} LiDAR feature association exploiting the prior structure information obtained by the polynomial smooth kernel. The Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization (GOSO) module first sparsifies the graph according to optimality for an \textit{efficient} optimization. GOSO then utilizes stochastic clustering and graph marginalization to solve the large-scale state estimation problem for a \textit{scalable} LBA. We validate PSS-GOSO across diverse scenes captured by various platforms, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the resulting point cloud maps are used for automatic last-mile delivery in large-scale complex scenes.

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures | [Code Link](None) |

In response, posterior-based methods such as conditional Diffusion Models and Invertible Neural Networks have emerged; however, their translation is hampered by a lack of research on adequate validation. In other words, the way progress is measured often does not reflect the needs of the driving practical application. Closing this gap in the literature, we present the first systematic framework for the application-driven validation of posterior-based methods in inverse problems. As a methodological novelty, it adopts key principles from the field of object detection validation, which has a long history of addressing the question of how to locate and match multiple object instances in an image. Treating modes as instances enables us to perform mode-centric validation, using well-interpretable metrics from the application perspective. We demonstrate the value of our framework through instantiations for a synthetic toy example and two medical vision use cases: pose estimation in surgery and imaging-based quantification of functional tissue parameters for diagnostics. Our framework offers key advantages over common approaches to posterior validation in all three examples and could thus revolutionize performance assessment in inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accep...Accepted at Medical Image Analysis.

To address this we introduce BlanketGen2-Fit3D (BG2-Fit3D), an augmentation of Fit3D dataset that contains 1,217,312 frames with synthetic photo-realistic blankets. To generate it we used BlanketGen2, our new and improved version of our BlanketGen pipeline that simulates synthetic blankets using ground-truth Skinned Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL) meshes and then renders them as transparent images that can be layered on top of the original frames. This dataset was used in combination with the original Fit3D to finetune the ViTPose-B HPE model, to evaluate synthetic blanket augmentation effectiveness. The trained models were further evaluated on a real-world blanket occluded in-bed HPE dataset (SLP dataset). Comparing architectures trained on only Fit3D with the ones trained with our synthetic blanket augmentation the later improved pose estimation performance on BG2-Fit3D, the synthetic blanket occluded dataset significantly to (0.977 Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), 0.149 Normalized Mean Error (NME)) with an absolute 4.4% PCK increase. Furthermore, the test results on SLP demonstrated the utility of synthetic data augmentation by improving performance by an absolute 2.3% PCK, on real-world images with the poses occluded by real blankets. These results show synthetic blanket augmentation has the potential to improve in-bed blanket occluded HPE from RGB images. The dataset as well as the code will be made available to the public.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | [Code Link](None) |
| **[Towards Robust and Realistic Human Pose Estimation via WiFi Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09411v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ShowRobust WiFi-based human pose estimation is a challenging task that bridges discrete and subtle WiFi signals to human skeletons. This paper revisits this problem and reveals two critical yet overlooked issues: 1) cross-domain gap, i.e., due to significant variations between source-target domain pose distributions; and 2) structural fidelity gap, i.e., predicted skeletal poses manifest distorted topology, usually with misplaced joints and disproportionate bone lengths. This paper fills these gaps by reformulating the task into a novel two-phase framework dubbed DT-Pose: Domain-consistent representation learning and Topology-constrained Pose decoding. Concretely, we first propose a temporal-consistent contrastive learning strategy with uniformity regularization, coupled with self-supervised masking-reconstruction operations, to enable robust learning of domain-consistent and motion-discriminative WiFi-specific representations. Beyond this, we introduce a simple yet effective pose decoder with task prompts, which integrates Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and Transformer layers to constrain the topology structure of the generated skeleton by exploring the adjacent-overarching relationships among human joints. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of our method in tackling these fundamental challenges in both 2D/3D human pose estimation tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | [Code Link](None) |

While previous datasets have primarily focused on local poses, often limited to a single person or in constrained, indoor settings, the infrastructure deployed for this sporting event allows access to multiple fixed and moving cameras in different stadiums. We exploit the static multi-view setup of HD cameras to recover the 3D player poses and motions with unprecedented accuracy given capture areas of more than 1.75 acres. We then leverage the captured players' motions and field markings to calibrate a moving broadcasting camera. The resulting dataset comprises more than 80 sequences with approx 2.5 million 3D poses and a total traveling distance of over 120 km. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the SOTA methods for global pose estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that WorldPose challenges existing multi-person techniques, supporting the potential for new research in this area and others, such as sports analysis. All pose annotations (in SMPL format), broadcasting camera parameters and footage will be released for academic research purposes.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

Traditional methods rely on detailed 3D maps constructed using Structure from Motion (SfM) or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which is computationally expensive and impractical for dynamic or large-scale environments. We introduce MARLoc, a novel localization framework for AR applications that uses known relative transformations within image sequences to perform intra-sequence triangulation, generating 3D-2D correspondences for pose estimation and refinement. MARLoc eliminates the need for pre-built SfM maps, providing accurate and efficient localization suitable for dynamic outdoor environments. Evaluation with benchmark datasets and real-world experiments demonstrates MARLoc's state-of-the-art performance and robustness. By integrating MARLoc into an AR device, we highlight its capability to achieve precise localization in real-world outdoor scenarios, showcasing its practical effectiveness and potential to enhance visual localization in AR applications.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

Although many general-purpose tools exist for landmark localization in classical computer vision tasks, such as pose estimation, they lack the specialized features and modularity necessary for anatomical landmark localization applications in the medical domain. Therefore, we introduce landmarker, a Python package built on PyTorch. The package provides a comprehensive, flexible toolkit for developing and evaluating landmark localization algorithms, supporting a range of methodologies, including static and adaptive heatmap regression. landmarker enhances the accuracy of landmark identification, streamlines research and development processes, and supports various image formats and preprocessing pipelines. Its modular design allows users to customize and extend the toolkit for specific datasets and applications, accelerating innovation in medical imaging. landmarker addresses a critical need for precision and customization in landmark localization tasks not adequately met by existing general-purpose pose estimation tools.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | [Code Link](None) |
| **[A New Teacher-Reviewer-Student Framework for Semi-supervised 2D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09565v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ShowConventional 2D human pose estimation methods typically require extensive labeled annotations, which are both labor-intensive and expensive. In contrast, semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation can alleviate the above problems by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data along with a small portion of labeled data. Existing semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation methods update the network through backpropagation, ignoring crucial historical information from the previous training process. Therefore, we propose a novel semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation method by utilizing a newly designed Teacher-Reviewer-Student framework. Specifically, we first mimic the phenomenon that human beings constantly review previous knowledge for consolidation to design our framework, in which the teacher predicts results to guide the student's learning and the reviewer stores important historical parameters to provide additional supervision signals. Secondly, we introduce a Multi-level Feature Learning strategy, which utilizes the outputs from different stages of the backbone to estimate the heatmap to guide network training, enriching the supervisory information while effectively capturing keypoint relationships. Finally, we design a data augmentation strategy, i.e., Keypoint-Mix, to perturb pose information by mixing different keypoints, thus enhancing the network's ability to discern keypoints. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, demonstrate our method achieves significant improvements compared to the existing methods.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |
| **[Towards Balanced Continual Multi-Modal Learning in Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05264v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Show3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) has emerged as a prominent research topic, particularly in the realm of RGB-based methods. However, RGB images are susceptible to limitations such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and potential user discomfort. Consequently, multi-modal sensing, which leverages non-intrusive sensors, is gaining increasing attention. Nevertheless, multi-modal 3D HPE still faces challenges, including modality imbalance and the imperative for continual learning. In this work, we introduce a novel balanced continual multi-modal learning method for 3D HPE, which harnesses the power of RGB, LiDAR, mmWave, and WiFi. Specifically, we propose a Shapley value-based contribution algorithm to quantify the contribution of each modality and identify modality imbalance. To address this imbalance, we employ a re-learning strategy. Furthermore, recognizing that raw data is prone to noise contamination, we develop a novel denoising continual learning approach. This approach incorporates a noise identification and separation module to mitigate the adverse effects of noise and collaborates with the balanced learning strategy to enhance optimization. Additionally, an adaptive EWC mechanism is employed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-adopted multi-modal dataset, MM-Fi, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach in boosting 3D pose estimation and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in complex scenarios. We will release our codes.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

While single-frame pose estimation has seen significant progress, it often fails to capture the temporal dynamics for understanding complex, continuous movements. We propose Poseidon, a novel multi-frame pose estimation architecture that extends the ViTPose model by integrating temporal information for enhanced accuracy and robustness to address these limitations. Poseidon introduces key innovations: (1) an Adaptive Frame Weighting (AFW) mechanism that dynamically prioritises frames based on their relevance, ensuring that the model focuses on the most informative data; (2) a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module that aggregates features from different backbone layers to capture both fine-grained details and high-level semantics; and (3) a Cross-Attention module for effective information exchange between central and contextual frames, enhancing the model's temporal coherence. The proposed architecture improves performance in complex video scenarios and offers scalability and computational efficiency suitable for real-world applications. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PoseTrack21 and PoseTrack18 datasets, achieving mAP scores of 88.3 and 87.8, respectively, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |

Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

Among these, sparse feature matching stands out as an efficient, versatile, and generally lightweight approach with numerous applications. However, feature-based methods often struggle with significant viewpoint and appearance changes, leading to matching failures and inaccurate pose estimates. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages a globally sparse yet locally dense 3D representation of 2D features. By tracking and triangulating landmarks over a sequence of frames, we construct a sparse voxel map optimized to render image patch descriptors observed during tracking. Given an initial pose estimate, we first synthesize descriptors from the voxels using volumetric rendering and then perform feature matching to estimate the camera pose. This methodology enables the generation of descriptors for unseen views, enhancing robustness to view changes. We extensively evaluate our method on the 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets. Our results show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art feature representation techniques in indoor environments, achieving up to a 39% improvement in median translation error. Additionally, our approach yields comparable results to other methods for outdoor scenarios while maintaining lower memory and computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accep...Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), Tucson, Arizona, US, Feb 28-Mar 4, 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](None) |

Metric depth estimation, which involves predicting absolute distances, poses particular challenges, as even the most advanced foundation models remain prone to critical errors. Since quantifying the uncertainty has emerged as a promising endeavor to address these limitations and enable trustworthy deployment, we fuse five different uncertainty quantification methods with the current state-of-the-art DepthAnythingV2 foundation model. To cover a wide range of metric depth domains, we evaluate their performance on four diverse datasets. Our findings identify fine-tuning with the Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood Loss (GNLL) as a particularly promising approach, offering reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining predictive performance and computational efficiency on par with the baseline, encompassing both training and inference time. By fusing uncertainty quantification and foundation models within the context of monocular depth estimation, this paper lays a critical foundation for future research aimed at improving not only model performance but also its explainability. Extending this critical synthesis of uncertainty quantification and foundation models into other crucial tasks, such as semantic segmentation and pose estimation, presents exciting opportunities for safer and more reliable machine vision systems.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](None) |
