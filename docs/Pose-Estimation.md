| **[To Glue or Not to Glue? Classical vs Learned Image Matching for Mobile Mapping Cameras to Textured Semantic 3D Building Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17973v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion, and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions. Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve. We believe that this work will foster the development of model-based visual localization methods.

| **[Towards Dynamic 3D Reconstruction of Hand-Instrument Interaction in Ophthalmic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17677v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D reconstruction of hands and instruments is critical for vision-based analysis of ophthalmic microsurgery, yet progress has been hampered by the lack of realistic, large-scale datasets and reliable annotation tools. In this work, we introduce OphNet-3D, the first extensive RGB-D dynamic 3D reconstruction dataset for ophthalmic surgery, comprising 41 sequences from 40 surgeons and totaling 7.1 million frames, with fine-grained annotations of 12 surgical phases, 10 instrument categories, dense MANO hand meshes, and full 6-DoF instrument poses. To scalably produce high-fidelity labels, we design a multi-stage automatic annotation pipeline that integrates multi-view data observation, data-driven motion prior with cross-view geometric consistency and biomechanical constraints, along with a combination of collision-aware interaction constraints for instrument interactions. Building upon OphNet-3D, we establish two challenging benchmarks-bimanual hand pose estimation and hand-instrument interaction reconstruction-and propose two dedicated architectures: H-Net for dual-hand mesh recovery and OH-Net for joint reconstruction of two-hand-two-instrument interactions. These models leverage a novel spatial reasoning module with weak-perspective camera modeling and collision-aware center-based representation. Both architectures outperform existing methods by substantial margins, achieving improvements of over 2mm in Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and up to 23% in ADD-S metrics for hand and instrument reconstruction, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PoseBH: Prototypical Multi-Dataset Training Beyond Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17475v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study multi-dataset training (MDT) for pose estimation, where skeletal heterogeneity presents a unique challenge that existing methods have yet to address. In traditional domains, \eg regression and classification, MDT typically relies on dataset merging or multi-head supervision. However, the diversity of skeleton types and limited cross-dataset supervision complicate integration in pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce PoseBH, a new MDT framework that tackles keypoint heterogeneity and limited supervision through two key techniques. First, we propose nonparametric keypoint prototypes that learn within a unified embedding space, enabling seamless integration across skeleton types. Second, we develop a cross-type self-supervision mechanism that aligns keypoint predictions with keypoint embedding prototypes, providing supervision without relying on teacher-student models or additional augmentations. PoseBH substantially improves generalization across whole-body and animal pose datasets, including COCO-WholeBody, AP-10K, and APT-36K, while preserving performance on standard human pose benchmarks (COCO, MPII, and AIC). Furthermore, our learned keypoint embeddings transfer effectively to hand shape estimation (InterHand2.6M) and human body shape estimation (3DPW). The code for PoseBH is available at: https://github.com/uyoung-jeong/PoseBH.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/uyoung-jeong/PoseBH) |
| **[Towards Texture- And Shape-Independent 3D Keypoint Estimation in Birds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16633v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a texture-independent approach to estimate and track 3D joint positions of multiple pigeons. For this purpose, we build upon the existing 3D-MuPPET framework, which estimates and tracks the 3D poses of up to 10 pigeons using a multi-view camera setup. We extend this framework by using a segmentation method that generates silhouettes of the individuals, which are then used to estimate 2D keypoints. Following 3D-MuPPET, these 2D keypoints are triangulated to infer 3D poses, and identities are matched in the first frame and tracked in 2D across subsequent frames. Our proposed texture-independent approach achieves comparable accuracy to the original texture-dependent 3D-MuPPET framework. Additionally, we explore our approach's applicability to other bird species. To do that, we infer the 2D joint positions of four bird species without additional fine-tuning the model trained on pigeons and obtain preliminary promising results. Thus, we think that our approach serves as a solid foundation and inspires the development of more robust and accurate texture-independent pose estimation frameworks.</p></details> |  | None |

They are affordable, portable, and programmable, which makes them ideal for testing, data acquisition, controlling mobile robots, and many other robotic applications. A robotic system is proposed in this paper, consisting of an Android phone, a microcontroller board attached to the phone via USB, and a remote wireless controller station. In the data acquisition mode, the Android device can record a dataset of a diverse configuration of multiple cameras, IMUs, GNSS units, and external USB ADC channels in the rawest format used for, but not limited to, pose estimation and scene reconstruction applications. In robot control mode, the Android phone, a microcontroller board, and other peripherals constitute the mobile or stationary robotic system. This system is controlled using a remote server connected over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Experiments show that although the SLAM and AR applications can utilize the acquired data, the proposed system can pave the way for more advanced algorithms for processing these noisy and sporadic measurements. Moreover, the characteristics of the communication media are studied, and two example robotic projects, which involve controlling a toy car and a quadcopter, are included.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project repository: https://github.com/m-dayani/robo-platform Youtube Video: https://youtu.be/BTQ4yLB1bak Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZqdA1xa-SyJ64qL_TibqhtwhR1fWWrx?usp=sharing</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/m-dayani/robo-platform) |
| **[GMatch: Geometry-Constrained Feature Matching for RGB-D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16144v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GMatch, a learning-free feature matcher designed for robust 6DoF object pose estimation, addressing common local ambiguities in sparse feature matching. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on descriptor similarity, GMatch performs a guided, incremental search, enforcing SE(3)-invariant geometric consistency throughout the matching process. It leverages a provably complete set of geometric features that uniquely determine 3D keypoint configurations, ensuring globally consistent correspondences without the need for training or GPU support. When combined with classical descriptors such as SIFT, GMatch-SIFT forms a general-purpose pose estimation pipeline that offers strong interpretability and generalization across diverse objects and scenes. Experiments on the HOPE dataset show that GMatch outperforms both traditional and learning-based matchers, with GMatch-SIFT achieving or surpassing the performance of instance-level pose networks. On the YCB-Video dataset, GMatch-SIFT demonstrates high accuracy and low variance on texture-rich objects. These results not only validate the effectiveness of GMatch-SIFT for object pose estimation but also highlight the broader applicability of GMatch as a general-purpose feature matcher. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages + 3 pages references + 2 pages appendix; 6 figures; 1 table</p></details> | None |
| **[Object-Focus Actor for Data-efficient Robot Generalization Dexterous Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15098v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot manipulation learning from human demonstrations offers a rapid means to acquire skills but often lacks generalization across diverse scenes and object placements. This limitation hinders real-world applications, particularly in complex tasks requiring dexterous manipulation. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigm leverages large-scale data to enhance generalization. However, due to data scarcity, VLA's performance remains limited. In this work, we introduce Object-Focus Actor (OFA), a novel, data-efficient approach for generalized dexterous manipulation. OFA exploits the consistent end trajectories observed in dexterous manipulation tasks, allowing for efficient policy training. Our method employs a hierarchical pipeline: object perception and pose estimation, pre-manipulation pose arrival and OFA policy execution. This process ensures that the manipulation is focused and efficient, even in varied backgrounds and positional layout. Comprehensive real-world experiments across seven tasks demonstrate that OFA significantly outperforms baseline methods in both positional and background generalization tests. Notably, OFA achieves robust performance with only 10 demonstrations, highlighting its data efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FaVoR: Features via Voxel Rendering for Camera Relocalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07571v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera relocalization methods range from dense image alignment to direct camera pose regression from a query image. Among these, sparse feature matching stands out as an efficient, versatile, and generally lightweight approach with numerous applications. However, feature-based methods often struggle with significant viewpoint and appearance changes, leading to matching failures and inaccurate pose estimates. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages a globally sparse yet locally dense 3D representation of 2D features. By tracking and triangulating landmarks over a sequence of frames, we construct a sparse voxel map optimized to render image patch descriptors observed during tracking. Given an initial pose estimate, we first synthesize descriptors from the voxels using volumetric rendering and then perform feature matching to estimate the camera pose. This methodology enables the generation of descriptors for unseen views, enhancing robustness to view changes. We extensively evaluate our method on the 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets. Our results show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art feature representation techniques in indoor environments, achieving up to a 39% improvement in median translation error. Additionally, our approach yields comparable results to other methods for outdoor scenarios while maintaining lower memory and computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), Tucson, Arizona, US, Feb 28-Mar 4, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Reconstructing People, Places, and Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17806v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present "Humans and Structure from Motion" (HSfM), a method for jointly reconstructing multiple human meshes, scene point clouds, and camera parameters in a metric world coordinate system from a sparse set of uncalibrated multi-view images featuring people. Our approach combines data-driven scene reconstruction with the traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) framework to achieve more accurate scene reconstruction and camera estimation, while simultaneously recovering human meshes. In contrast to existing scene reconstruction and SfM methods that lack metric scale information, our method estimates approximate metric scale by leveraging a human statistical model. Furthermore, it reconstructs multiple human meshes within the same world coordinate system alongside the scene point cloud, effectively capturing spatial relationships among individuals and their positions in the environment. We initialize the reconstruction of humans, scenes, and cameras using robust foundational models and jointly optimize these elements. This joint optimization synergistically improves the accuracy of each component. We compare our method to existing approaches on two challenging benchmarks, EgoHumans and EgoExo4D, demonstrating significant improvements in human localization accuracy within the world coordinate frame (reducing error from 3.51m to 1.04m in EgoHumans and from 2.9m to 0.56m in EgoExo4D). Notably, our results show that incorporating human data into the SfM pipeline improves camera pose estimation (e.g., increasing RRA@15 by 20.3% on EgoHumans). Additionally, qualitative results show that our approach improves overall scene reconstruction quality.

While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across all datasets.

| **[Proximity and Visuotactile Point Cloud Fusion for Contact Patches in Extreme Deformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03839v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visuotactile sensors are a popular tactile sensing strategy due to high-fidelity estimates of local object geometry. However, existing algorithms for processing raw sensor inputs to useful intermediate signals such as contact patches struggle in high-deformation regimes. This is due to physical constraints imposed by sensor hardware and small-deformation assumptions used by mechanics-based models. In this work, we propose a fusion algorithm for proximity and visuotactile point clouds for contact patch segmentation, entirely independent from membrane mechanics. This algorithm exploits the synchronous, high spatial resolution proximity and visuotactile modalities enabled by an extremely deformable, selectively transmissive soft membrane, which uses visible light for visuotactile sensing and infrared light for proximity depth. We evaluate our contact patch algorithm in low (10%), medium (60%), and high (100%+) strain states. We compare our method against three baselines: proximity-only, tactile-only, and a first principles mechanics model. Our approach outperforms all baselines with an average RMSE under 2.8 mm of the contact patch geometry across all strain ranges. We demonstrate our contact patch algorithm in four applications: varied stiffness membranes, torque and shear-induced wrinkling, closed loop control, and pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Recollection from Pensieve: Novel View Synthesis via Learning from Uncalibrated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13440v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training. These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth information.

While emerging technologies are making it easier to capture kinematics with biomechanical models, or how joint angles change over time, inferring the underlying physics that give rise to these movements, including ground reaction forces, joint torques, or even muscle activations, is still challenging. Here we explore whether imitation learning applied to a biomechanical model from a large dataset of movements from able-bodied and impaired individuals can learn to compute these inverse dynamics. Although imitation learning in human pose estimation has seen great interest in recent years, our work differences in several ways: we focus on using an accurate biomechanical model instead of models adopted for computer vision, we test it on a dataset that contains participants with impaired movements, we reported detailed tracking metrics relevant for the clinical measurement of movement including joint angles and ground contact events, and finally we apply imitation learning to a muscle-driven neuromusculoskeletal model. We show that our imitation learning policy, KinTwin, can accurately replicate the kinematics of a wide range of movements, including those with assistive devices or therapist assistance, and that it can infer clinically meaningful differences in joint torques and muscle activations. Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning to enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice.</p></details> |  | None |

However, no climbing dataset with detailed hold usage annotations exists to our knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a dataset of 22 annotated climbing videos, providing ground-truth labels for hold locations, usage order, and time of use. Furthermore, we explore the application of keypoint-based 2D pose-estimation models for detecting hold usage in sport climbing. We determine usage by analyzing the key points of certain joints and the corresponding overlap with climbing holds. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models and analyze their accuracy on our dataset, identifying and highlighting climbing-specific challenges. Our dataset and results highlight key challenges in climbing-specific pose estimation and establish a foundation for future research toward AI-assisted systems for sports climbing.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at the International Workshop on Computer Vision in Sports (CVsports) at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph of Feature Map for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v5)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parse graph play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of human pose estimation (HPE). Its key advantage lies in its hierarchical structure, like a tree structure, and context relations among nodes, which enable more accurate for inference. To equip models with the advantage of parse graphs, many researchers predefine the parse graph of body structure for HPE. However, these frameworks struggle to adapt to instances that deviate from the predefined parse graph and they are often parameter-heavy. Unlike them, we view the feature map holistically, much like the human body. It can be optimized using parse graphs, where nodes' implicit feature representation boosts adaptability, avoiding rigid structural limitations. In this paper, we design the Refinement Module based on the Parse Graph of feature map (RMPG), which includes two stages: top-down decomposition and bottom-up combination. In the first stage, the feature map is constructed into a tree structure through recursive decomposition, with each node representing a sub-feature map, thereby achieving hierarchical modeling of features. In the second stage, context information is calculated and sub-feature maps with context are recursively connected to gradually build a refined feature map. Additionally, we design a hierarchical network with fewer parameters using multiple RMPG modules to model the context relations and hierarchies in the parse graph of body structure for HPE, some of which are supervised to obtain context relations among body parts. Our network achieves excellent results on multiple mainstream human pose datasets and the effectiveness of RMPG is proven on different methods. The code of RMPG will be open.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PseudoNeg-MAE: Self-Supervised Point Cloud Learning using Conditional Pseudo-Negative Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15832v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose PseudoNeg-MAE, a novel self-supervised learning framework that enhances global feature representation of point cloud masked autoencoder by making them both discriminative and sensitive to transformations. Traditional contrastive learning methods focus on achieving invariance, discarding transformation-specific information. Recent approaches incorporate transformation sensitivity by explicitly modeling relationships between original and transformed inputs. However, they report an invariant-collapse phenomenon, where the predictor degenerates into identity mappings, resulting in latent representations that have limited variation across transformations. We propose a novel loss that explicitly penalizes invariant collapse, enabling the network to capture richer transformation cues while preserving discriminative representations. PseudoNeg-MAE uses a parametric network COPE, which learns the localized displacements caused by transformations within the latent space. However, jointly training COPE with the MAE leads to undesirable trivial solutions where COPE outputs collapse to an identity. To address this, we propose a loss that uses transformation-conditioned pseudo-negatives, to penalize such trivial invariant solutions. We validate PseudoNeg-MAE on shape classification and relative pose estimation tasks, where it achieves competitive performance on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets under challenging evaluation protocols and demonstrates superior accuracy in estimating relative poses compared to supervised methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Keypoints as Dynamic Centroids for Unified Human Pose and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12130v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic movement of the human body presents a fundamental challenge for human pose estimation and body segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance.

| **[Black-box Adversaries from Latent Space: Unnoticeable Attacks on Human Pose and Shape Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12009v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expressive human pose and shape (EHPS) estimation is vital for digital human generation, particularly in live-streaming applications. However, most existing EHPS models focus primarily on minimizing estimation errors, with limited attention on potential security vulnerabilities. Current adversarial attacks on EHPS models often require white-box access (e.g., model details or gradients) or generate visually conspicuous perturbations, limiting their practicality and ability to expose real-world security threats. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Unnoticeable Black-Box Attack (UBA) against EHPS models. UBA leverages the latent-space representations of natural images to generate an optimal adversarial noise pattern and iteratively refine its attack potency along an optimized direction in digital space. Crucially, this process relies solely on querying the model's output, requiring no internal knowledge of the EHPS architecture, while guiding the noise optimization toward greater stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments and visual analyses demonstrate the superiority of UBA. Notably, UBA increases the pose estimation errors of EHPS models by 17.27%-58.21% on average, revealing critical vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the urgent need to address and mitigate security risks associated with digital human generation systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures | None |

In order to overcome this difficulty, we present ElderFallGuard: A Computer Vision Based IoT Solution for Elderly Fall Detection and Notification, a cutting-edge, non-invasive system intended for quick caregiver alerts and real-time fall detection. Our approach leverages the power of computer vision, utilizing MediaPipe for accurate human pose estimation from standard video streams. We developed a custom dataset comprising 7200 samples across 12 distinct human poses to train and evaluate various machine learning classifiers, with Random Forest ultimately selected for its superior performance. ElderFallGuard employs a specific detection logic, identifying a fall when a designated prone pose ("Pose6") is held for over 3 seconds coupled with a significant drop in motion detected for more than 2 seconds. Upon confirmation, the system instantly dispatches an alert, including a snapshot of the event, to a designated Telegram group via a custom bot, incorporating cooldown logic to prevent notification overload.

| **[SurgPose: Generalisable Surgical Instrument Pose Estimation using Zero-Shot Learning and Stereo Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11439v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pose estimation of surgical tools in Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) is essential for surgical navigation and robot control. While traditional marker-based methods offer accuracy, they face challenges with occlusions, reflections, and tool-specific designs. Similarly, supervised learning methods require extensive training on annotated datasets, limiting their adaptability to new tools. Despite their success in other domains, zero-shot pose estimation models remain unexplored in RMIS for pose estimation of surgical instruments, creating a gap in generalising to unseen surgical tools. This paper presents a novel 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose estimation pipeline for surgical instruments, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-shot RGB-D models like the FoundationPose and SAM-6D. We advanced these models by incorporating vision-based depth estimation using the RAFT-Stereo method, for robust depth estimation in reflective and textureless environments. Additionally, we enhanced SAM-6D by replacing its instance segmentation module, Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN, significantly boosting segmentation accuracy in occluded and complex conditions. Extensive validation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in zero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS. This work enhances the generalisability of pose estimation for unseen objects and pioneers the application of RGB-D zero-shot methods in RMIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> | None |

However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16 unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles, varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions, making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision.

| **[PoseBench3D: A Cross-Dataset Analysis Framework for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10888v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable three-dimensional human pose estimation is becoming increasingly important for real-world applications, yet much of prior work has focused solely on the performance within a single dataset. In practice, however, systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups -- conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we present a standardized testing environment in which each method is evaluated on a variety of datasets, ensuring consistent and fair cross-dataset comparisons -- allowing for the analysis of methods on previously unseen data. Therefore, we propose PoseBench3D, a unified framework designed to systematically re-evaluate prior and future models across four of the most widely used datasets for human pose estimation -- with the framework able to support novel and future datasets as the field progresses. Through a unified interface, our framework provides datasets in a pre-configured yet easily modifiable format, ensuring compatibility with diverse model architectures. We re-evaluated the work of 18 methods, either trained or gathered from existing literature, and reported results using both Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and Procrustes Aligned Mean Per Joint Position Error (PA-MPJPE) metrics, yielding more than 100 novel cross-dataset evaluation results. Additionally, we analyze performance differences resulting from various pre-processing techniques and dataset preparation parameters -- offering further insight into model generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/bryanjvela/PoseLab3D/tree/submission_branch</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/bryanjvela/PoseLab3D) |

To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage, RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence. This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Fast and Robust Localization for Humanoid Soccer Robot via Iterative Landmark Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11020v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate robot localization is essential for effective operation. Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is commonly used with known maps but is computationally expensive due to landmark matching for each particle. Humanoid robots face additional challenges, including sensor noise from locomotion vibrations and a limited field of view (FOV) due to camera placement. This paper proposes a fast and robust localization method via iterative landmark matching (ILM) for humanoid robots. The iterative matching process improves the accuracy of the landmark association so that it does not need MCL to match landmarks to particles. Pose estimation with the outlier removal process enhances its robustness to measurement noise and faulty detections. Furthermore, an additional filter can be utilized to fuse inertial data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and pose data from localization. We compared ILM with Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which shows that ILM method is more robust towards the error in the initial guess and easier to get a correct matching. We also compared ILM with the Augmented Monte Carlo Localization (aMCL), which shows that ILM method is much faster than aMCL and even more accurate. The proposed method's effectiveness is thoroughly evaluated through experiments and validated on the humanoid robot ARTEMIS during RoboCup 2024 adult-sized soccer competition.</p></details> |  | None |

DINO-X employs the same Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture as Grounding DINO 1.5 to pursue an object-level representation for open-world object understanding. To make long-tailed object detection easy, DINO-X extends its input options to support text prompt, visual prompt, and customized prompt. With such flexible prompt options, we develop a universal object prompt to support prompt-free open-world detection, making it possible to detect anything in an image without requiring users to provide any prompt. To enhance the model's core grounding capability, we have constructed a large-scale dataset with over 100 million high-quality grounding samples, referred to as Grounding-100M, for advancing the model's open-vocabulary detection performance. Pre-training on such a large-scale grounding dataset leads to a foundational object-level representation, which enables DINO-X to integrate multiple perception heads to simultaneously support multiple object perception and understanding tasks, including detection, segmentation, pose estimation, object captioning, object-based QA, etc. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DINO-X. Specifically, the DINO-X Pro model achieves 56.0 AP, 59.8 AP, and 52.4 AP on the COCO, LVIS-minival, and LVIS-val zero-shot object detection benchmarks, respectively. Notably, it scores 63.3 AP and 56.5 AP on the rare classes of LVIS-minival and LVIS-val benchmarks, improving the previous SOTA performance by 5.8 AP and 5.0 AP. Such a result underscores its significantly improved capacity for recognizing long-tailed objects.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

We bridge this gap by leveraging large multimodal models (LMMs) as priors for reconstructing contact poses, offering a scalable alternative to traditional methods that rely on human annotations or motion capture data. Our approach extracts contact-relevant descriptors from an LMM and translates them into tractable losses to constrain 3D human pose optimization. Despite its simplicity, our method produces compelling reconstructions for both two-person interactions and self-contact scenarios, accurately capturing the semantics of physical and social interactions. Our results demonstrate that LMMs can serve as powerful tools for contact prediction and pose estimation, offering an alternative to costly manual human annotations or motion capture data.

However, they often fail to capture the level of detail required for inspection and scene awareness tasks. Conversely, dense SLAM approaches generate richer scene reconstructions but impose a prohibitive computational load to create 3D maps. We present a novel distributed volumetric mapping framework designated as CRADMap that addresses these issues by extending the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ORBSLAM3 system with the COVINS on the backend for global optimization. Our pipeline for volumetric reconstruction fuses dense keyframes at a centralized server via 5G connectivity, aggregating geometry, and occupancy information from multiple autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) without overtaxing onboard resources. This enables each AMR to independently perform mapping while the backend constructs high-fidelity real-time 3D maps. To operate Beyond the Visible (BtV) and overcome the limitations of standard visual sensors, we automated a standalone 4D mmWave radar module that functions independently without sensor fusion with SLAM. The BtV system enables the detection and mapping of occluded metallic objects in cluttered environments, enhancing situational awareness in inspection scenarios. Experimental validation in Section~\ref{sec:IV} demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, IEEE, ICARM</p></details> | None |
| **[Optimal-state Dynamics Estimation for Physics-based Human Motion Capture from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07795v4)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion capture from monocular videos has made significant progress in recent years. However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

The unique solution for non-ambiguous objects can turn into a multi-modal pose distribution for symmetrical objects or when occlusions of symmetry-breaking elements happen, depending on the viewpoint. Currently, 6D pose estimation methods are benchmarked on datasets that consider, for their ground truth annotations, visual ambiguities as only related to global object symmetries, whereas they should be defined per-image to account for the camera viewpoint. We thus first propose an automatic method to re-annotate those datasets with a 6D pose distribution specific to each image, taking into account the object surface visibility in the image to correctly determine the visual ambiguities. Second, given this improved ground truth, we re-evaluate the state-of-the-art single pose methods and show that this greatly modifies the ranking of these methods. Third, as some recent works focus on estimating the complete set of solutions, we derive a precision/recall formulation to evaluate them against our image-wise distribution ground truth, making it the first benchmark for pose distribution methods on real images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UMotion: Uncertainty-driven Human Motion Estimation from Inertial and Ultra-wideband Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09393v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have gained popularity for estimating 3D human motion. However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over state of the art in pose accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Poor localization accuracy is often a consequence of inaccurate initial poses, particularly noticeable in GNSS-denied environments where GPS signals are primarily relied upon for initialization. Recent advances in leveraging deep neural networks for pose regression have led to significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness, especially in estimating complex spatial relationships and orientations. In this paper, we introduce APR-Transformer, a model architecture inspired by state-of-the-art methods, which predicts absolute pose (3D position and 3D orientation) using either image or LiDAR data. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmark datasets such as the Radar Oxford Robot-Car and DeepLoc datasets. Furthermore, we extend our experiments to include our custom complex APR-BeIntelli dataset. Additionally, we validate the reliability of our approach in GNSS-denied environments by deploying the model in real-time on an autonomous test vehicle. This showcases the practical feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.

However, implementing accurate autonomous control can be difficult due to poor end-effector proprioception, a limitation of their cable-driven mechanisms. Although the robot may have joint encoders for the end-effector pose calculation, various non-idealities make the entire kinematics chain inaccurate. Modern vision-based pose estimation methods lack real-time capability or can be hard to train and generalize. In this work, we demonstrate a real-time capable, vision transformer-based pose estimation approach that is trained using end-to-end differentiable kinematics and rendering in simulation. We demonstrate the potential of this method to correct for noisy pose estimates in simulation, with the longer term goal of verifying the sim-to-real transferability of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ERPoT: Effective and Reliable Pose Tracking for Mobile Robots Using Lightweight Polygon Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14723v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an effective and reliable pose tracking solution, termed ERPoT, for mobile robots operating in large-scale outdoor and challenging indoor environments, underpinned by an innovative prior polygon map. Especially, to overcome the challenge that arises as the map size grows with the expansion of the environment, the novel form of a prior map composed of multiple polygons is proposed. Benefiting from the use of polygons to concisely and accurately depict environmental occupancy, the prior polygon map achieves long-term reliable pose tracking while ensuring a compact form. More importantly, pose tracking is carried out under pure LiDAR mode, and the dense 3D point cloud is transformed into a sparse 2D scan through ground removal and obstacle selection. On this basis, a novel cost function for pose estimation through point-polygon matching is introduced, encompassing two distinct constraint forms: point-to-vertex and point-to-edge. In this study, our primary focus lies on two crucial aspects: lightweight and compact prior map construction, as well as effective and reliable robot pose tracking. Both aspects serve as the foundational pillars for future navigation across diverse mobile platforms equipped with different LiDAR sensors in varied environments. Comparative experiments based on the publicly available datasets and our self-recorded datasets are conducted, and evaluation results show the superior performance of ERPoT on reliability, prior map size, pose estimation error, and runtime over the other six approaches.

However, current SCR methods often face challenges in handling repetitive textures and meaningless areas due to their reliance on implicit triangulation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate SCR system. Compared to existing SCR methods, we propose a unified architecture for both scene encoding and salient keypoint detection, allowing our system to prioritize the encoding of informative regions. This design significantly improves computational efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a mechanism that utilizes sequential information during both mapping and relocalization. The proposed method enhances the implicit triangulation, especially in environments with repetitive textures. Comprehensive experiments conducted across indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SCR methods. Our single-frame relocalization mode improves the recall rate of our baseline by 6.4% and increases the running speed from 56Hz to 90Hz. Furthermore, our sequence-based mode increases the recall rate by 11% while maintaining the original efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

We focus on four-way sleep position classification using data collected from a PSM placed under a mattress in a sleep clinic. Sleep positions can affect sleep quality and the prevalence of sleep disorders, such as apnea. Measurements were performed on patients with suspected sleep disorders referred for assessments at a sleep clinic. Training deep learning models can be challenging in clinical settings due to the need for large amounts of labeled data. To overcome the shortage of labeled training data, we utilize transfer learning to adapt pre-trained deep learning models to accurately estimate sleep positions from a low-resolution PSM dataset collected in a polysomnography sleep lab. Our approach leverages Vision Transformer models pre-trained on ImageNet using masked autoencoding (ViTMAE) and a pre-trained model for human pose estimation (ViTPose). These approaches outperform previous work from PSM-based sleep pose classification using deep learning (TCN) as well as traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) that use engineered features. We evaluate the performance of sleep position classification from 112 nights of patient recordings and validate it on a higher resolution 13-patient dataset.

Ergonomic assessments can mitigate these risks by identifying workplace adjustments that improve posture and reduce strain. Camera-based systems offer a non-intrusive, cost-effective method for continuous ergonomic tracking, but they also raise significant privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a privacy-aware ergonomic assessment framework utilizing machine learning techniques. Our approach employs adversarial training to develop a lightweight neural network that obfuscates video data, preserving only the essential information needed for human pose estimation. This obfuscation ensures compatibility with standard pose estimation algorithms, maintaining high accuracy while protecting privacy. The obfuscated video data is transmitted to a central server, where state-of-the-art keypoint detection algorithms extract body landmarks. Using multi-view integration, 3D keypoints are reconstructed and evaluated with the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method.

Special motivation comes from the fact that relative pose estimation, based on standard 5-point or 7-point Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithms, can fail even when no outliers are present and there is enough data to support a hypothesis. We argue that these cases arise due to the intrinsic instability of the 5- and 7-point minimal problems. We apply our framework to characterize the instabilities, both in terms of the world scenes that lead to infinite condition number, and directly in terms of ill-conditioned image data. The approach produces computational tests for assessing the condition number before solving the minimal problem. Lastly, synthetic and real data experiments suggest that RANSAC serves not only to remove outliers, but in practice it also selects for well-conditioned image data, which is consistent with our theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: a...</summary><p>v2: additional experiments; correction to Theorem 20 (with current numbering); other edits</p></details> | None |

In robotics, active tactile perception has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task. These findings underscore the potential of TAP as a versatile and generalizable framework for advancing active tactile perception in robotics.</p></details> | 16 pages; 13 figures | None |

Compared to vision-based systems, full-body pose estimation from sparse tracking signals is not limited by environmental conditions or recording range. However, previous works either face the challenge of wearing additional sensors on the pelvis and lower-body or rely on external visual sensors to obtain global positions of key joints. To improve the practicality of the technology for virtual reality applications, we estimate full-body poses using only inertial data obtained from three Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors worn on the head and wrists, thereby reducing the complexity of the hardware system. In this work, we propose a method called Progressive Inertial Poser (ProgIP) for human pose estimation, which combines neural network estimation with a human dynamics model, considers the hierarchical structure of the kinematic chain, and employs a multi-stage progressive network estimation with increased depth to reconstruct full-body motion in real time. The encoder combines Transformer Encoder and bidirectional LSTM (TE-biLSTM) to flexibly capture the temporal dependencies of the inertial sequence, while the decoder based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) transforms high-dimensional features and accurately projects them onto Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model parameters. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on multiple public datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the same inputs, and is comparable to recent works using six IMU sensors.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a method that improves the performance of deep learning-based monocular 3D human pose estimation models by using multiview data only during training, but not during inference. We introduce a novel loss function, consistency loss, which operates on two synchronized views. This approach is simpler than previous models that require 3D ground truth or intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Our consistency loss penalizes differences in two pose sequences after rigid alignment. We also demonstrate that our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning without requiring 3D data. Furthermore, we show that using our consistency loss can yield state-of-the-art performance when training models from scratch in a semi-supervised manner. Our findings provide a simple way to capture new data, e.g in a new domain. This data can be added using off-the-shelf cameras with no calibration requirements. We make all our code and data publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MonST3R: A Simple Approach for Estimating Geometry in the Presence of Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03825v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating geometry from dynamic scenes, where objects move and deform over time, remains a core challenge in computer vision. Current approaches often rely on multi-stage pipelines or global optimizations that decompose the problem into subtasks, like depth and flow, leading to complex systems prone to errors. In this paper, we present Motion DUSt3R (MonST3R), a novel geometry-first approach that directly estimates per-timestep geometry from dynamic scenes. Our key insight is that by simply estimating a pointmap for each timestep, we can effectively adapt DUST3R's representation, previously only used for static scenes, to dynamic scenes. However, this approach presents a significant challenge: the scarcity of suitable training data, namely dynamic, posed videos with depth labels. Despite this, we show that by posing the problem as a fine-tuning task, identifying several suitable datasets, and strategically training the model on this limited data, we can surprisingly enable the model to handle dynamics, even without an explicit motion representation. Based on this, we introduce new optimizations for several downstream video-specific tasks and demonstrate strong performance on video depth and camera pose estimation, outperforming prior work in terms of robustness and efficiency. Moreover, MonST3R shows promising results for primarily feed-forward 4D reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 25, Project page: https://monst3r-project.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, human global motions are still challenging to be reconstructed by IMUs. This paper aims to solve this problem by involving physics. It proposes a physical optimization scheme based on multiple contacts to enable physically plausible translation estimation in the full 3D space where the z-directional motion is usually challenging for previous works. It also considers gravity in local pose estimation which well constrains human global orientations and refines local pose estimation in a joint estimation manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate motion capture for both local poses and global motions. Furthermore, by deeply integrating physics, we can also estimate 3D contact, contact forces, joint torques, and interacting proxy surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025.

This paper presents an efficient method for precise pose estimation of cuboid-shaped objects, which aims to reduce errors in target pose in a time-efficient manner. Typical pose estimation methods like global point cloud registrations are prone to minor pose errors for which local registration algorithms are generally used to improve pose accuracy. However, due to the execution time overhead and uncertainty in the error of the final achieved pose, an alternate, linear time approach is proposed for pose error estimation and correction.

| **[Pose Estimation for Intra-cardiac Echocardiography Catheter via AI-Based Anatomical Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07851v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) plays a crucial role in Electrophysiology (EP) and Structural Heart Disease (SHD) interventions by providing high-resolution, real-time imaging of cardiac structures. However, existing navigation methods rely on electromagnetic (EM) tracking, which is susceptible to interference and position drift, or require manual adjustments based on operator expertise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anatomy-aware pose estimation system that determines the ICE catheter position and orientation solely from ICE images, eliminating the need for external tracking sensors. Our approach leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based deep learning model, which captures spatial relationships between ICE images and anatomical structures. The model is trained on a clinically acquired dataset of 851 subjects, including ICE images paired with position and orientation labels normalized to the left atrium (LA) mesh. ICE images are patchified into 16x16 embeddings and processed through a transformer network, where a [CLS] token independently predicts position and orientation via separate linear layers. The model is optimized using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, balancing positional and orientational accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate an average positional error of 9.48 mm and orientation errors of (16.13 deg, 8.98 deg, 10.47 deg) across x, y, and z axes, confirming the model accuracy. Qualitative assessments further validate alignment between predicted and target views within 3D cardiac meshes. This AI-driven system enhances procedural efficiency, reduces operator workload, and enables real-time ICE catheter localization for tracking-free procedures. The proposed method can function independently or complement existing mapping systems like CARTO, offering a transformative approach to ICE-guided interventions.</p></details> |  | None |

These developments have led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in sports analysis and performance evaluation. This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners, focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles. The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to 6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in applications where high accuracy is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the paper presented to the Third Workshop on Learning with Few or Without Annotated Face, Body, and Gesture Data on 19th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2025</p></details> | None |

At the cost of ever-increasing computational load and sensor complexity, odometry algorithms have reached impressive levels of accuracy with minimal drift in various conditions. In this paper, we question the need for more research on odometry for autonomous driving by assessing the accuracy of one of the simplest algorithms: the direct integration of wheel encoder data and yaw rate measurements from a gyroscope. We denote this algorithm as Odometer-Gyroscope (OG) odometry. This work shows that OG odometry can outperform current state-of-the-art radar-inertial SE(2) odometry for a fraction of the computational cost in most scenarios. For example, the OG odometry is on top of the Boreas leaderboard with a relative translation error of 0.20%, while the second-best method displays an error of 0.26%. Lidar-inertial approaches can provide more accurate estimates, but the computational load is three orders of magnitude higher than the OG odometry. To further the analysis, we have pushed the limits of the OG odometry by purposely violating its fundamental no-slip assumption using data collected during a heavy snowstorm with different driving behaviours. Our conclusion shows that a significant amount of slippage is required to result in non-satisfactory pose estimates from the OG odometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025, Field Robotics workshop</p></details> | None |

HDiffTG leverages the strengths of these techniques to significantly improve pose estimation accuracy and robustness while maintaining a lightweight design. The Transformer captures global spatiotemporal dependencies, the GCN models local skeletal structures, and the diffusion model provides step-by-step optimization for fine-tuning, achieving a complementary balance between global and local features.

These requirements make generalization to novel objects difficult for which neither 3D models nor multi-view images may be available. To address this, we propose a novel method One2Any that estimates the relative 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) object pose using only a single reference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of its 3D model, multi-view data, or category constraints. We treat object pose estimation as an encoding-decoding process, first, we obtain a comprehensive Reference Object Pose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an object shape, orientation, and texture from a single reference view. Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding module produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC) for new views, enabling fast and accurate pose estimation. This simple encoding-decoding framework allows our model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data, enabling large-scale training and demonstrating great scalability. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model generalizes well to novel objects, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness even rivaling methods that require multi-view or CAD inputs, at a fraction of compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

In this work, we analyze camera motion from a first principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera manipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that motion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This motivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating training convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by probing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we observe that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and only a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This suggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the architecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to a 4x reduction of training parameters, improved training speed, and 10% higher visual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control learning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse, dynamic videos with stationary cameras. This helps the model distinguish between camera and scene motion and improves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos. We compound these findings to design the Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture, the new state-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project Page: https://snap-research.github.io/ac3d/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://snap-research.github.io/ac3d) |

While deep learning-based human pose estimation (HPE) models from RGB videos have achieved impressive performance on public datasets, their effectiveness in real-world sports scenarios is often hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts across different pose representations. Fine-tuning these models can partially alleviate such challenges but typically requires large-scale annotated data and still struggles to generalize across diverse sports environments. To address these limitations, we propose a 2D pose prior-guided refinement approach based on Neural Distance Fields (NDF). Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on angular representations of human poses, we introduce a polar coordinate-based representation that explicitly incorporates joint connection lengths, enabling a more accurate correction of erroneous pose estimations. Additionally, we define a novel non-geodesic distance metric that separates angular and radial discrepancies, which we demonstrate is better suited for polar representations than traditional geodesic distances. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a gradient-based batch-projection augmentation strategy, which synthesizes realistic pose samples through iterative refinement. Our method is evaluated on a long jump dataset, demonstrating its ability to improve 2D pose estimation across multiple pose representations, making it robust across different domains. Experimental results show that our approach enhances pose plausibility while requiring only limited training data.

Despite great progress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative visual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas, or repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network called \textit{LiftFeat}, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by aggregating 3D geometric feature. Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate that our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods.

Pre-training with large-scale images achieves promising results in various tasks, but prior methods for 3D hand pose pre-training have not fully utilized the potential of diverse hand images accessible from in-the-wild videos. To facilitate scalable pre-training, we first prepare an extensive pool of hand images from in-the-wild videos and design our pre-training method with contrastive learning. Specifically, we collect over 2.0M hand images from recent human-centric videos, such as 100DOH and Ego4D. To extract discriminative information from these images, we focus on the similarity of hands: pairs of non-identical samples with similar hand poses. We then propose a novel contrastive learning method that embeds similar hand pairs closer in the feature space. Our method not only learns from similar samples but also adaptively weights the contrastive learning loss based on inter-sample distance, leading to additional performance gains. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional contrastive learning approaches that produce positive pairs sorely from a single image with data augmentation.

Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities, leading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this problem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP Challenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose solution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not straightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities drastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these ambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first learns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's surface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation enables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D correspondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution using PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex non-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art solutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from an RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory when handling with large angle or small area inputs. These limitations are particularly pronounced on fingerprints captured by under-screen fingerprint sensors in smartphones. In this paper, we present a novel dual-modal input based network for under-screen fingerprint pose estimation. Our approach effectively integrates two distinct yet complementary modalities: texture details extracted from ridge patches through the under-screen fingerprint sensor, and rough contours derived from capacitive images obtained via the touch screen. This collaborative integration endows our network with more comprehensive and discriminative information, substantially improving the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. A decoupled probability distribution prediction task is designed, instead of the traditional supervised forms of numerical regression or heatmap voting, to facilitate the training process. Additionally, we incorporate a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based feature fusion mechanism and a relationship driven cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy to further strengthen feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted on several public datasets and two private datasets. The results indicate that our method is significantly superior to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and remarkably boosts the recognition ability of fingerprint recognition algorithms.

Existing methods either estimate and decompose the essential matrix or directly estimate the rotation and translation to obtain the solution. In this article, we break the mold by tackling this traditional problem with a novel birotation solution. We first introduce three basis transformations, each associated with a geometric metric to quantify the distance between the relative pose to be estimated and its corresponding basis transformation. Three energy functions, designed based on these metrics, are then minimized on the Riemannian manifold $\mathrm{SO(3)}$ by iteratively updating the two rotation matrices. The two rotation matrices and the basis transformation corresponding to the minimum energy are ultimately utilized to recover the relative pose. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse relative pose estimation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed birotation solution.

However, the quality of underwater images is often degraded due to medium interference, which limits the effectiveness of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose estimation, leading to subsequent reconstruction failures. Additionally, SfM methods typically operate at slower speeds, further hindering their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce AquaGS, an SfM-free underwater scene reconstruction model based on the SeaThru algorithm, which facilitates rapid and accurate separation of scene details and medium features. Our approach initializes Gaussians by integrating state-of-the-art multi-view stereo (MVS) technology, employs implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for rendering translucent media and utilizes the latest explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render object surfaces, which effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods and accurately simulates underwater optical phenomena.

However, a key challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation, PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss, improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models.

Current frameworks use neural network encoders to extract image features and downstream layers to predict joint angles and robot pose. While images of robots inherently contain rich information about the robot's physical structures, existing methods often fail to leverage it fully; therefore, limiting performance under occlusions and truncations. To address this, we introduce RoboPEPP, a method that fuses information about the robot's physical model into the encoder using a masking-based self-supervised embedding-predictive architecture. Specifically, we mask the robot's joints and pre-train an encoder-predictor model to infer the joints' embeddings from surrounding unmasked regions, enhancing the encoder's understanding of the robot's physical model. The pre-trained encoder-predictor pair, along with joint angle and keypoint prediction networks, is then fine-tuned for pose and joint angle estimation. Random masking of input during fine-tuning and keypoint filtering during evaluation further improves robustness. Our method, evaluated on several datasets, achieves the best results in robot pose and joint angle estimation while being the least sensitive to occlusions and requiring the lowest execution time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[T-Graph: Enhancing Sparse-view Camera Pose Estimation by Pairwise Translation Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01207v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse-view camera pose estimation, which aims to estimate the 6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) poses from a limited number of images captured from different viewpoints, is a fundamental yet challenging problem in remote sensing applications. Existing methods often overlook the translation information between each pair of viewpoints, leading to suboptimal performance in sparse-view scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce T-Graph, a lightweight, plug-and-play module to enhance camera pose estimation in sparse-view settings. T-graph takes paired image features as input and maps them through a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). It then constructs a fully connected translation graph, where nodes represent cameras and edges encode their translation relationships. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing models as an additional branch in parallel with the original prediction, maintaining efficiency and ease of use. Furthermore, we introduce two pairwise translation representations, relative-t and pair-t, formulated under different local coordinate systems. While relative-t captures intuitive spatial relationships, pair-t offers a rotation-disentangled alternative. The two representations contribute to enhanced adaptability across diverse application scenarios, further improving our module's robustness. Extensive experiments on two state-of-the-art methods (RelPose++ and Forge) using public datasets (C03D and IMC PhotoTourism) validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of T-Graph. The results demonstrate consistent improvements across various metrics, notably camera center accuracy, which improves by 1% to 6% from 2 to 8 viewpoints.</p></details> |  | None |

Intersections offer strong landmarks to correct vehicle pose estimation in GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data in up-to-date maps. They are also decisive routing nodes in road network graphs. Despite that importance, intersection localization has not been widely studied, with existing methods either ignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper presents a LiDAR-based method for online vehicle-centric intersection localization. We fuse semantic road segmentation with vehicle local pose to detect intersection candidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation. We then refine those candidates by analyzing branch topology and correcting the intersection point in a least squares formulation. To evaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs localized intersection points with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS ground-truth poses. Experiments on SemanticKITTI show that the method outperforms the latest learning-based baseline in accuracy and reliability. Moreover, sensitivity tests demonstrate that our method is robust to challenging segmentation error levels, highlighting its applicability in the real world.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial Graph Order Attention and Temporal Body Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01003v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, Transformers and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are the prevailing techniques for 3D human pose estimation. However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code and models are made available on Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

The common approach to relative pose estimation is to apply a minimal solver inside a RANSAC loop. Highly efficient solvers exist for pinhole cameras. Yet, (nearly) all cameras exhibit radial distortion. Not modeling radial distortion leads to (significantly) worse results. However, minimal radial distortion solvers are significantly more complex than pinhole solvers, both in terms of run-time and implementation efforts. This paper compares radial distortion solvers with two simple-to-implement approaches that do not use minimal radial distortion solvers: The first approach combines an efficient pinhole solver with sampled radial undistortion parameters, where the sampled parameters are used for undistortion prior to applying the pinhole solver. The second approach uses a state-of-the-art neural network to estimate the distortion parameters rather than sampling them from a set of potential values. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, and different camera setups, show that complex minimal radial distortion solvers are not necessary in practice. We discuss under which conditions a simple sampling of radial undistortion parameters is preferable over calibrating cameras using a learning-based prior approach. Code and newly created benchmark for relative pose estimation under radial distortion are available at https://github.com/kocurvik/rdnet.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.05984</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/kocurvik/rdnet) |

Each insole, fabricated with e-textile garment techniques, costs under USD 1, making it significantly cheaper than commercial alternatives and ideal for large-scale production. Our approach uses foot pressure distribution, acceleration, and rotation data to overcome limitations, providing a lightweight, minimally intrusive, and privacy-aware solution. The system employs a Transformer model for efficient temporal feature extraction, enriched by first and second derivatives in the input stream. Including multimodal information, such as accelerometers and rotational measurements, improves the accuracy of complex motion pattern recognition. These facts are demonstrated experimentally, while error metrics show the robustness of the approach in various posture estimation tasks. This work could be the foundation for a low-cost, practical application in rehabilitation, injury prevention, and health monitoring while enabling further development through sensor optimization and expanded datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies. This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food, allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential. Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The 3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and accurate dietary monitoring tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 CVPR MetaFood Workshop</p></details> | None |

Current grasp planners, however, are hindered by limited vision-language comprehension and time-consuming 3D radiance modeling, restricting real-time, open-vocabulary interactions with objects. To address these limitations, we propose GLOVER, a unified Generalizable Open-Vocabulary Affordance Reasoning framework, which fine-tunes the Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict the visual affordance of graspable object parts within RGB feature space. We compile a dataset of over 10,000 images from human-object interactions, annotated with unified visual and linguistic affordance labels, to enable multi-modal fine-tuning. GLOVER inherits world knowledge and common-sense reasoning from LLMs, facilitating more fine-grained object understanding and sophisticated tool-use reasoning. To enable effective real-world deployment, we present Affordance-Aware Grasping Estimation (AGE), a non-parametric grasp planner that aligns the gripper pose with a superquadric surface derived from affordance data. In evaluations across 30 table-top real-world scenes, GLOVER achieves success rates of 86.0% in part identification and 76.3% in grasping, with speeds approximately 29 times faster in affordance reasoning and 40 times faster in grasping pose estimation than the previous state-of-the-art. We also validate the generalization across embodiments, showing effectiveness in humanoid robots with dexterous hands.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BRIGHT-VO: Brightness-Guided Hybrid Transformer for Visual Odometry with Multi-modality Refinement Module](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08659v4)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual odometry (VO) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and other related tasks by estimating the position and orientation of a camera based on visual input. Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods.

Yet, unlike other problems where large-scale supervised training has enabled rapid progress, directly supervising methods for recovering 3D motion remains challenging due to the fundamental difficulty of obtaining ground truth annotations. We present a system for mining high-quality 4D reconstructions from internet stereoscopic, wide-angle videos. Our system fuses and filters the outputs of camera pose estimation, stereo depth estimation, and temporal tracking methods into high-quality dynamic 3D reconstructions. We use this method to generate large-scale data in the form of world-consistent, pseudo-metric 3D point clouds with long-term motion trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of this data by training a variant of DUSt3R to predict structure and 3D motion from real-world image pairs, showing that training on our reconstructed data enables generalization to diverse real-world scenes.

| **[Self-Supervised Monocular Visual Drone Model Identification through Improved Occlusion Handling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21695v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ego-motion estimation is vital for drones when flying in GPS-denied environments. Vision-based methods struggle when flight speed increases and close-by objects lead to difficult visual conditions with considerable motion blur and large occlusions. To tackle this, vision is typically complemented by state estimation filters that combine a drone model with inertial measurements. However, these drone models are currently learned in a supervised manner with ground-truth data from external motion capture systems, limiting scalability to different environments and drones. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme to train a neural-network-based drone model using only onboard monocular video and flight controller data (IMU and motor feedback). We achieve this by first training a self-supervised relative pose estimation model, which then serves as a teacher for the drone model. To allow this to work at high speed close to obstacles, we propose an improved occlusion handling method for training self-supervised pose estimation models. Due to this method, the root mean squared error of resulting odometry estimates is reduced by an average of 15%. Moreover, the student neural drone model can be successfully obtained from the onboard data. It even becomes more accurate at higher speeds compared to its teacher, the self-supervised vision-based model. We demonstrate the value of the neural drone model by integrating it into a traditional filter-based VIO system (ROVIO), resulting in superior odometry accuracy on aggressive 3D racing trajectories near obstacles. Self-supervised learning of ego-motion estimation represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between flying in controlled, expensive lab environments and real-world drone applications. The fusion of vision and drone models will enable higher-speed flight and improve state estimation, on any drone in any environment.</p></details> |  | None |

The dataset offers over 833 minutes (3.7M+ images) of recordings that feature 19 subjects interacting with 33 diverse rigid objects. In addition to simple pick-up, observe, and put-down actions, the subjects perform actions typical for a kitchen, office, and living room environment. The recordings include multiple synchronized data streams containing egocentric multi-view RGB/monochrome images, eye gaze signal, scene point clouds, and 3D poses of cameras, hands, and objects. The dataset is recorded with two headsets from Meta: Project Aria, which is a research prototype of AI glasses, and Quest 3, a virtual-reality headset that has shipped millions of units. Ground-truth poses were obtained by a motion-capture system using small optical markers attached to hands and objects. Hand annotations are provided in the UmeTrack and MANO formats, and objects are represented by 3D meshes with PBR materials obtained by an in-house scanner. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-view egocentric data for three popular tasks: 3D hand tracking, model-based 6DoF object pose estimation, and 3D lifting of unknown in-hand objects. The evaluated multi-view methods, whose benchmarking is uniquely enabled by HOT3D, significantly outperform their single-view counterparts.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |
| **[Dance Style Recognition Using Laban Movement Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21166v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing interest in automated movement analysis has presented new challenges in recognition of complex human activities including dance. This study focuses on dance style recognition using features extracted using Laban Movement Analysis. Previous studies for dance style recognition often focus on cross-frame movement analysis, which limits the ability to capture temporal context and dynamic transitions between movements. This gap highlights the need for a method that can add temporal context to LMA features. For this, we introduce a novel pipeline which combines 3D pose estimation, 3D human mesh reconstruction, and floor aware body modeling to effectively extract LMA features. To address the temporal limitation, we propose a sliding window approach that captures movement evolution across time in features. These features are then used to train various machine learning methods for classification, and their explainability explainable AI methods to evaluate the contribution of each feature to classification performance. Our proposed method achieves a highest classification accuracy of 99.18\% which shows that the addition of temporal context significantly improves dance style recognition performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, previous research studied these human-centric tasks individually, whose performance is largely limited to the size of the public task-specific datasets. Recent human-centric methods leverage the additional modalities, e.g., depth, to learn fine-grained semantic information, which limits the benefit of pretraining models due to their sensitivity to camera views and the scarcity of RGB-D data on the Internet. This paper improves the data scalability of human-centric pretraining methods by discarding depth information and exploring semantic information of RGB images in the frequency space by Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We further propose new annotation denoising auxiliary tasks with keypoints and DCT maps to enforce the RGB image extractor to learn fine-grained semantic information of human bodies. Our extensive experiments show that when pretrained on large-scale datasets (COCO and AIC datasets) without depth annotation, our model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods by +0.5 mAP on COCO, +1.4 PCKh on MPII and -0.51 EPE on Human3.6M for pose estimation, by +4.50 mIoU on Human3.6M for human parsing, by -3.14 MAE on SHA and -0.07 MAE on SHB for crowd counting, by +1.1 F1 score on SHA and +0.8 F1 score on SHA for crowd localization, and by +0.1 mAP on Market1501 and +0.8 mAP on MSMT for person ReID.

COLMAP is frequently employed for preprocessing to estimate poses, while it necessitates a large number of feature matches to operate effectively, and it struggles with scenes characterized by sparse features, large baselines between images, or a limited number of input images. We aim to tackle few-view NeRF reconstruction using only 3 to 6 unposed scene images. Traditional methods often use calibration boards but they are not common in images. We propose a novel idea of utilizing everyday objects, commonly found in both images and real life, as "pose probes". The probe object is automatically segmented by SAM, whose shape is initialized from a cube. We apply a dual-branch volume rendering optimization (object NeRF and scene NeRF) to constrain the pose optimization and jointly refine the geometry. Specifically, object poses of two views are first estimated by PnP matching in an SDF representation, which serves as initial poses. PnP matching, requiring only a few features, is suitable for feature-sparse scenes. Additional views are incrementally incorporated to refine poses from preceding views. In experiments, PoseProbe achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pose estimation and novel view synthesis across multiple datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly in few-view and large-baseline scenes where COLMAP struggles. In ablations, using different objects in a scene yields comparable performance.

However, reliable camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction from such unconstrained videos remains an open challenge. Existing visual-only SLAM methods perform well on benchmark datasets but struggle with real-world footage which often exhibits uncontrolled motion including rapid rotations and pure forward movements, textureless regions, and dynamic objects. We analyze the limitations of current methods and introduce a robust pipeline designed to improve 3D reconstruction from casual videos. We build upon recent deep visual odometry methods but increase robustness in several ways. Camera intrinsics are automatically recovered from the first few frames using structure-from-motion. Dynamic objects and less-constrained areas are masked with a predictive model. Additionally, we leverage monocular depth estimates to regularize bundle adjustment, mitigating errors in low-parallax situations. Finally, we integrate place recognition and loop closure to reduce long-term drift and refine both intrinsics and pose estimates through global bundle adjustment. We demonstrate large-scale contiguous 3D models from several online videos in various environments. In contrast, baseline methods typically produce locally inconsistent results at several points, producing separate segments or distorted maps. In lieu of ground-truth pose data, we evaluate map consistency, execution time and visual accuracy of re-rendered NeRF models. Our proposed system establishes a new baseline for visual reconstruction from casual uncontrolled videos found online, demonstrating more consistent reconstructions over longer sequences of in-the-wild videos than previously achieved.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix the overview figure</p></details> | None |

First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods fail to relocalize when faced with significantly different viewpoints. We present ROMAN (Robust Object Map Alignment Anywhere), a global localization method capable of localizing in challenging and diverse environments by creating and aligning maps of open-set and view-invariant objects. ROMAN formulates and solves a registration problem between object submaps using a unified graph-theoretic global data association approach with a novel incorporation of a gravity direction prior and object shape and semantic similarity. This work's open-set object mapping and information-rich object association algorithm enables global localization, even in instances when maps are created from robots traveling in opposite directions. Through a set of challenging global localization experiments in indoor, urban, and unstructured/forested environments, we demonstrate that ROMAN achieves higher relative pose estimation accuracy than other image-based pose estimation methods or segment-based registration methods. Additionally, we evaluate ROMAN as a loop closure module in large-scale multi-robot SLAM and show a 35% improvement in trajectory estimation error compared to standard SLAM systems using visual features for loop closures.

While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes. To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, preprint, submitted to Robotics And Autonomous Systems</p></details> | None |

To address this challenge, we introduce our novel 'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a 2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps. The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems. Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field, improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, preprint conference submission</p></details> | None |

The complexity of a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions. This paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D pose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how to bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach generalization and provide actionable recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Austrian Robotics Workshop 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[CordViP: Correspondence-based Visuomotor Policy for Dexterous Manipulation in Real-World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08449v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-level dexterity in robots is a key objective in the field of robotic manipulation. Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in six real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of multi-robot cooperative exploration systems. First, we review the evolution of robotic exploration and introduce a modular research framework tailored for multi-robot cooperative exploration. Based on this framework, we systematically categorize and summarize key system components. As a foundational module for multi-robot exploration, the localization and mapping module is primarily introduced by focusing on global and relative pose estimation, as well as multi-robot map merging techniques. The cooperative motion module is further divided into learning-based approaches and multi-stage planning, with the latter encompassing target generation, task allocation, and motion planning strategies. Given the communication constraints of real-world environments, we also analyze the communication module, emphasizing how robots exchange information within local communication ranges and under limited transmission capabilities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions for multi-robot cooperative exploration in light of real-world trends. This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Certifiably-Correct Mapping for Safe Navigation Despite Odometry Drift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18713v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate perception, state estimation and mapping are essential for safe robotic navigation as planners and controllers rely on these components for safety-critical decisions. However, existing mapping approaches often assume perfect pose estimates, an unrealistic assumption that can lead to incorrect obstacle maps and therefore collisions. This paper introduces a framework for certifiably-correct mapping that ensures that the obstacle map correctly classifies obstacle-free regions despite the odometry drift in vision-based localization systems (VIO}/SLAM). By deflating the safe region based on the incremental odometry error at each timestep, we ensure that the map remains accurate and reliable locally around the robot, even as the overall odometry error with respect to the inertial frame grows unbounded. Our contributions include two approaches to modify popular obstacle mapping paradigms, (I) Safe Flight Corridors, and (II) Signed Distance Fields. We formally prove the correctness of both methods, and describe how they integrate with existing planning and control modules. Simulations using the Replica dataset highlight the efficacy of our methods compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Real-world experiments with a robotic rover show that, while baseline methods result in collisions with previously mapped obstacles, the proposed framework enables the rover to safely stop before potential collisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication to RSS 2025. 24 pages, 9 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[SSD-Poser: Avatar Pose Estimation with State Space Duality from Sparse Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18332v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing applications of AR/VR increase the demand for real-time full-body pose estimation from Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). Although HMDs provide joint signals from the head and hands, reconstructing a full-body pose remains challenging due to the unconstrained lower body. Recent advancements often rely on conventional neural networks and generative models to improve performance in this task, such as Transformers and diffusion models. However, these approaches struggle to strike a balance between achieving precise pose reconstruction and maintaining fast inference speed. To overcome these challenges, a lightweight and efficient model, SSD-Poser, is designed for robust full-body motion estimation from sparse observations. SSD-Poser incorporates a well-designed hybrid encoder, State Space Attention Encoders, to adapt the state space duality to complex motion poses and enable real-time realistic pose reconstruction. Moreover, a Frequency-Aware Decoder is introduced to mitigate jitter caused by variable-frequency motion signals, remarkably enhancing the motion smoothness. Comprehensive experiments on the AMASS dataset demonstrate that SSD-Poser achieves exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency, showing outstanding inference efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, conference ICMR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[S3MOT: Monocular 3D Object Tracking with Selective State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18068v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable multi-object tracking (MOT) in 3D space is essential for advancing robotics and computer vision applications. However, it remains a significant challenge in monocular setups due to the difficulty of mining 3D spatiotemporal associations from 2D video streams. In this work, we present three innovative techniques to enhance the fusion and exploitation of heterogeneous cues for monocular 3D MOT: (1) we introduce the Hungarian State Space Model (HSSM), a novel data association mechanism that compresses contextual tracking cues across multiple paths, enabling efficient and comprehensive assignment decisions with linear complexity. HSSM features a global receptive field and dynamic weights, in contrast to traditional linear assignment algorithms that rely on hand-crafted association costs. (2) We propose Fully Convolutional One-stage Embedding (FCOE), which eliminates ROI pooling by directly using dense feature maps for contrastive learning, thus improving object re-identification accuracy under challenging conditions such as varying viewpoints and lighting. (3) We enhance 6-DoF pose estimation through VeloSSM, an encoder-decoder architecture that models temporal dependencies in velocity to capture motion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of frame-based 3D inference. Experiments on the KITTI public test benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance of 76.86~HOTA at 31~FPS. Our approach outperforms the previous best by significant margins of +2.63~HOTA and +3.62~AssA, showcasing its robustness and efficiency for monocular 3D MOT tasks.

However, collecting such a dataset is difficult, as most Internet videos are unsuitable for pose estimation. Furthermore, annotating dynamic Internet videos present significant challenges even for state-of-theart methods. In this paper, we introduce DynPose-100K, a large-scale dataset of dynamic Internet videos annotated with camera poses. Our collection pipeline addresses filtering using a carefully combined set of task-specific and generalist models. For pose estimation, we combine the latest techniques of point tracking, dynamic masking, and structure-from-motion to achieve improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that DynPose-100K is both large-scale and diverse across several key attributes, opening up avenues for advancements in various downstream applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[A Guide to Structureless Visual Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17636v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual localization algorithms, i.e., methods that estimate the camera pose of a query image in a known scene, are core components of many applications, including self-driving cars and augmented / mixed reality systems. State-of-the-art visual localization algorithms are structure-based, i.e., they store a 3D model of the scene and use 2D-3D correspondences between the query image and 3D points in the model for camera pose estimation. While such approaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes to adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless localization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known poses and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily updated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of literature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on structureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the best of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of structureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a higher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose accuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or semi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based on pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art structure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at the cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction for future work.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Object Pose Estimation by Camera Arm Control Based on the Next Viewpoint Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17424v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have developed a new method to estimate a Next Viewpoint (NV) which is effective for pose estimation of simple-shaped products for product display robots in retail stores. Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN) based on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly decreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current view point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based methods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects have few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the pose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate, the NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation NN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV estimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\%, which was 7.4pt higher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we verified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\% of products.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, leveraging statistical theory, we develop an asymptotically unbiased and $\sqrt {n}$-consistent PnP estimator that accounts for varying 3D triangulation uncertainties, ensuring that the relative pose estimate converges to the ground truth as the number of features increases. Next, on the stereo VO pipeline side, we propose a framework that continuously triangulates contemporary features for tracking new frames, effectively decoupling temporal dependencies between pose and 3D point errors. We integrate the Bias-Eli-W PnP estimator into the proposed stereo VO pipeline, creating a synergistic effect that enhances the suppression of pose estimation errors. We validate the performance of our method on the KITTI and Oxford RobotCar datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method: 1) achieves significant improvements in both relative pose error and absolute trajectory error in large-scale environments; 2) provides reliable localization under erratic and unpredictable robot motions. The successful implementation of the Bias-Eli-W PnP in stereo VO indicates the importance of information screening in robotic estimation tasks with high-uncertainty measurements, shedding light on diverse applications where PnP is a key ingredient.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |

In this study, we proposed a novel architecture named Transformer based Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) designed for estimating human skeleton poses from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net integrates convolutional encoders with transformer based attention mechanisms to capture spatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses were used as input to a customized Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action recognition. We validated our model on two datasets: a publicly available multi modal dataset for assessing general pose estimation, and a newly collected dataset focused on fall related scenarios involving 20 participants. Experimental results demonstrated that TED Net outperformed existing approaches in pose estimation, and that the DGNN achieves reliable action classification using CSI based skeletons, with performance comparable to RGB based systems. Notably, TED Net maintains robust performance across both fall and non fall cases. These findings highlight the potential of CSI driven human skeleton estimation for effective action recognition, particularly in home environments such as elderly fall detection. In such settings, WiFi signals are often readily available, offering a privacy preserving alternative to vision based methods, which may raise concerns about continuous camera monitoring.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

This study presents a deep learning-based model for detecting cattle lameness, sickness, or gait abnormalities using publicly available video data. The dataset consists of 50 unique videos from 40 individual cattle, recorded from various angles in both indoor and outdoor environments. Half of the dataset represents naturally walking (normal/non-lame) cattle, while the other half consists of cattle exhibiting gait abnormalities (lame). To enhance model robustness and generalizability, data augmentation was applied to the training data. The pre-processed videos were then classified using two deep learning models: ConvLSTM2D and 3D CNN. A comparative analysis of the results demonstrates strong classification performance. Specifically, the 3D CNN model achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 90.9%, 90.9%, and 90.91% respectively. The ConvLSTM2D model exhibited a slightly lower accuracy of 85%. This study highlights the effectiveness of directly applying classification models to learn spatiotemporal features from video data, offering an alternative to traditional multi-stage approaches that typically involve object detection, pose estimation, and feature extraction. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the proposed deep learning models, particularly the 3D CNN, effectively classify and detect lameness in cattle while simplifying the processing pipeline.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SmallGS: Gaussian Splatting-based Camera Pose Estimation for Small-Baseline Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17810v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic videos with small baseline motions are ubiquitous in daily life, especially on social media. However, these videos present a challenge to existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting, which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this, we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g. DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features, SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature correspondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of SmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves impressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and DORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

The current approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign language videos through pose information into English-based ID glosses, which serve to uniquely identify ASL signs. Note that there is no shared convention for assigning such glosses to ASL signs, so it is essential that the same glossing conventions are used for all of the data in the datasets that are employed. This paper proposes SignX, a foundation model framework for sign recognition. It is a concise yet powerful framework applicable to multiple human activity recognition scenarios. First, we developed a Pose2Gloss component based on an inverse diffusion model, which contains a multi-track pose fusion layer that unifies five of the most powerful pose information sources--SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens Segmentation--into a single latent pose representation. Second, we trained a Video2Pose module based on ViT that can directly convert raw video into signer pose representation. Through this 2-stage training framework, we enable sign language recognition models to be compatible with existing pose formats, laying the foundation for the common pose estimation necessary for sign recognition. Experimental results show that SignX can recognize signs from sign language video, producing predicted gloss representations with greater accuracy than has been reported in prior work.</p></details> |  | None |

Although utilizing facial landmarks is valuable for this purpose, existing landmark-based methods prioritize precision over simplicity and model size, limiting their deployment on edge devices and in compute-poor environments. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Grouped Attention Deep Sets (GADS)}, a novel architecture based on the Deep Set framework. By grouping landmarks into regions and employing small Deep Set layers, we reduce computational complexity. Our multihead attention mechanism extracts and combines inter-group information, resulting in a model that is $7.5\times$ smaller and executes $25\times$ faster than the current lightest state-of-the-art model. Notably, our method achieves an impressive reduction, being $4321\times$ smaller than the best-performing model. We introduce vanilla GADS and Hybrid-GADS (landmarks + RGB) and evaluate our models on three benchmark datasets -- AFLW2000, BIWI, and 300W-LP.

This paper presents an interactive 3D-to-2D visualization and annotation tool to support the 6D pose estimation research community. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed work is the first tool that allows users to visualize and manipulate 3D objects interactively on a 2D real-world scene, along with a comprehensive user study. This system supports robust 6D camera pose annotation by providing both visual cues and spatial relationships to determine object position and orientation in various environments. The annotation feature in Vision6D is particularly helpful in scenarios where the transformation matrix between the camera and world objects is unknown, as it enables accurate annotation of these objects' poses using only the camera intrinsic matrix. This capability serves as a foundational step in developing and training advanced pose estimation models across various domains. We evaluate Vision6D's effectiveness by utilizing widely-used open-source pose estimation datasets Linemod and HANDAL through comparisons between the default ground-truth camera poses with manual annotations. A user study was performed to show that Vision6D generates accurate pose annotations via visual cues in an intuitive 3D user interface. This approach aims to bridge the gap between 2D scene projections and 3D scenes, offering an effective way for researchers and developers to solve 6D pose annotation related problems.

While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence. To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness. We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view understanding.

Although many previous methods attempt to mitigate intra-class variations, they often struggle with instances exhibiting complex geometries or significant deviations from canonical shapes. To address this challenge, we propose INKL-Pose, a novel category-level object pose estimation framework that enables INstance-adaptive Keypoint Learning with local-to-global geometric aggregation. Specifically, our approach first predicts semantically consistent and geometric informative keypoints through an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Generator, then refines them with: (1) a Local Keypoint Feature Aggregator capturing fine-grained geometries, and (2) a Global Keypoint Feature Aggregator using bidirectional Mamba for structural consistency. To enable bidirectional modeling in Mamba, we introduce a Feature Sequence Flipping strategy that preserves spatial coherence while constructing backward feature sequences. Additionally, we design a surface loss and a separation loss to enforce uniform coverage and spatial diversity in keypoint distribution. The generated keypoints are finally mapped to a canonical space for regressing the object's 6D pose and size. Extensive experiments on CAMERA25, REAL275, and HouseCat6D demonstrate that INKL-Pose achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Back on Track: Bundle Adjustment for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14516v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional SLAM systems, which rely on bundle adjustment, struggle with highly dynamic scenes commonly found in casual videos. Such videos entangle the motion of dynamic elements, undermining the assumption of static environments required by traditional systems. Existing techniques either filter out dynamic elements or model their motion independently. However, the former often results in incomplete reconstructions, whereas the latter can lead to inconsistent motion estimates. Taking a novel approach, this work leverages a 3D point tracker to separate the camera-induced motion from the observed motion of dynamic objects. By considering only the camera-induced component, bundle adjustment can operate reliably on all scene elements as a result. We further ensure depth consistency across video frames with lightweight post-processing based on scale maps. Our framework combines the core of traditional SLAM -- bundle adjustment -- with a robust learning-based 3D tracker front-end. Integrating motion decomposition, bundle adjustment and depth refinement, our unified framework, BA-Track, accurately tracks the camera motion and produces temporally coherent and scale-consistent dense reconstructions, accommodating both static and dynamic elements. Our experiments on challenging datasets reveal significant improvements in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wrchen530.github.io/projects/batrack/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wrchen530.github.io/projects) |
| **[SG-Reg: Generalizable and Efficient Scene Graph Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14440v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of registering two rigid semantic scene graphs, an essential capability when an autonomous agent needs to register its map against a remote agent, or against a prior map. The hand-crafted descriptors in classical semantic-aided registration, or the ground-truth annotation reliance in learning-based scene graph registration, impede their application in practical real-world environments. To address the challenges, we design a scene graph network to encode multiple modalities of semantic nodes: open-set semantic feature, local topology with spatial awareness, and shape feature. These modalities are fused to create compact semantic node features. The matching layers then search for correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner. In the back-end, we employ a robust pose estimator to decide transformation according to the correspondences. We manage to maintain a sparse and hierarchical scene representation. Our approach demands fewer GPU resources and fewer communication bandwidth in multi-agent tasks. Moreover, we design a new data generation approach using vision foundation models and a semantic mapping module to reconstruct semantic scene graphs. It differs significantly from previous works, which rely on ground-truth semantic annotations to generate data. We validate our method in a two-agent SLAM benchmark.

Due to the relative ease to collect, human demonstrations constitute a valuable addition when incorporated appropriately. However, existing methods utilizing human demonstrations face challenges in inferring precise actions, ameliorating embodiment gaps, and fusing with frontier generalist robot training pipelines. In this work, building on prior studies that demonstrate the viability of using hand-held grippers for efficient data collection, we leverage the user's control over the gripper's appearance--specifically by assigning it a unique, easily segmentable color--to enable simple and reliable application of the RANSAC and ICP registration method for precise end-effector pose estimation. We show in simulation that precisely labeled human demonstrations on their own allow policies to reach on average 88.1% of the performance of using robot demonstrations, and boost policy performance when combined with robot demonstrations, despite the inherent embodiment gap.</p></details> |  | None |

However, as we observed, constrained by their matching-based principles, the reconstruction quality of existing models suffers significant degradation in challenging regions with limited matching cues, particularly in weakly textured areas and low-light conditions. To mitigate these limitations, we propose to harness the inherent robustness of monocular geometry estimation to compensate for the inherent shortcomings of matching-based methods. Specifically, we introduce a monocular-guided refinement module that integrates monocular geometric priors into multi-view reconstruction frameworks. This integration substantially enhances the robustness of multi-view reconstruction systems, leading to high-quality feed-forward reconstructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in both mutli-view camera pose estimation and point cloud accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses, and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality. Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation, novel view synthesis and runtime.

Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations {have been shown} to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained model.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, including appendix.

| **[CoDiff: Conditional Diffusion Model for Collaborative 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14891v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative 3D object detection holds significant importance in the field of autonomous driving, as it greatly enhances the perception capabilities of each individual agent by facilitating information exchange among multiple agents. However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise.

While recent advances leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity and real-time rendering, existing methods are often specialized and task-focused, lacking a unified framework for both generation and editing. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a comprehensive framework that addresses this gap by enabling direct 3DGS generation and editing. SplatFlow comprises two main components: a multi-view rectified flow (RF) model and a Gaussian Splatting Decoder (GSDecoder). The multi-view RF model operates in latent space, generating multi-view images, depths, and camera poses simultaneously, conditioned on text prompts, thus addressing challenges like diverse scene scales and complex camera trajectories in real-world settings. Then, the GSDecoder efficiently translates these latent outputs into 3DGS representations through a feed-forward 3DGS method. Leveraging training-free inversion and inpainting techniques, SplatFlow enables seamless 3DGS editing and supports a broad range of 3D tasks-including object editing, novel view synthesis, and camera pose estimation-within a unified framework without requiring additional complex pipelines. We validate SplatFlow's capabilities on the MVImgNet and DL3DV-7K datasets, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various 3D generation, editing, and inpainting-based tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://gohyojun15.github.io/SplatFlow/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://gohyojun15.github.io/SplatFlow) |

However, as these techniques migrate towards lower-fidelity IMUs on ubiquitous commodity devices, like phones, watches, and earbuds, challenges arise including compromised online performance, temporal consistency, and loss of global translation due to sensor noise and drift. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MobilePoser, a real-time system for full-body pose and global translation estimation using any available subset of IMUs already present in these consumer devices. MobilePoser employs a multi-stage deep neural network for kinematic pose estimation followed by a physics-based motion optimizer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining lightweight. We conclude with a series of demonstrative applications to illustrate the unique potential of MobilePoser across a variety of fields, such as health and wellness, gaming, and indoor navigation to name a few.</p></details> |  | None |

Localization in construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus on the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the global position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition accuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2 in mean error.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.</p></details> | 19 pages | None |

In this work, we combine 3D human pose and shape estimation with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a representation of the scene composed of a mixture of Gaussians. This allows training or fine-tuning a human model predictor on multi-view images alone, without 3D ground truth. Predicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging due to self-occlusions and dependence on articulations, while also needing to retain enough flexibility to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of standardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate spatial density and approximate initial position for the Gaussians. We can then train a transformer model to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as well as the other 3DGS attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show empirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can achieve near real-time inference of 3D human models from a single image without expensive diffusion models or 3D points supervision, thus making it ideal for the sport industry at any level. More importantly, rendering is an effective auxiliary objective to refine 3D pose estimation by accounting for clothes and other geometric variations.

However, the diversity of open-world scenarios poses a major challenge for the generalization of such systems to practical scenarios. Specifically, learned systems for scene measurement and state estimation tend to degrade when the application scenarios deviate from the training data, resulting to unreliable depth and pose estimation. Toward addressing this problem, this work aims to develop a visual odometry system that can fast adapt to diverse novel environments in an online manner. To this end, we construct a self-supervised online adaptation framework for monocular visual odometry aided by an online-updated depth estimation module. Firstly, we design a monocular depth estimation network with lightweight refiner modules, which enables efficient online adaptation. Then, we construct an objective for self-supervised learning of the depth estimation module based on the output of the visual odometry system and the contextual semantic information of the scene. Specifically, a sparse depth densification module and a dynamic consistency enhancement module are proposed to leverage camera poses and contextual semantics to generate pseudo-depths and valid masks for the online adaptation. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art learning-based approaches on urban, in-house datasets and a robot platform.

Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require cameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for high-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on conveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a variant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera to capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises COLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate camera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of Interest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of high-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate excellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an F-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose estimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup, overall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the method's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping applications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D reconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need for complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is especially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such as hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on optimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology to facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D phenotyping pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent methods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on geometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from the point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation for 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images, leading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for estimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method combines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS representations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified network to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets, and NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted class based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part. Finally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to recover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we introduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date, featuring photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real sensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Real-world deployments of our model in robotic tasks underscore its robustness and exceptional sim-to-real transfer capabilities, confirming its substantial practical utility.

In this work, we propose DMAGaze, a novel gaze estimation framework that exploits information from facial images in three aspects: gaze-relevant global features (disentangled from facial image), local eye features (extracted from cropped eye patch), and head pose estimation features, to improve overall performance. Firstly, we design a new continuous mask-based Disentangler to accurately disentangle gaze-relevant and gaze-irrelevant information in facial images by achieving the dual-branch disentanglement goal through separately reconstructing the eye and non-eye regions. Furthermore, we introduce a new cascaded attention module named Multi-Scale Global Local Attention Module (MS-GLAM). Through a customized cascaded attention structure, it effectively focuses on global and local information at multiple scales, further enhancing the information from the Disentangler. Finally, the global gaze-relevant features disentangled by the upper face branch, combined with head pose and local eye features, are passed through the detection head for high-precision gaze estimation. Our proposed DMAGaze has been extensively validated on two mainstream public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Additionally, we adapt TinyViT, a compact and efficient vision transformer for coordinate classification in HPE, providing a lightweight yet powerful backbone that enhances privacy-preserving deployment feasibility on resource-limited devices. Our approach is particularly valuable for multimedia interpretation tasks, enabling privacy-safe analysis and understanding of human motion across diverse visual media while preserving the semantic meaning required for downstream applications. Comprehensive experiments on the MPII Human Pose Dataset demonstrate significant performance enhancement with PDP-SGD achieving 78.48% PCKh@0.5 at a strict privacy budget ($\epsilon=0.2$), compared to 63.85% for standard DP-SGD. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.</p></details> |  | None |

For this task, monocular category-level methods are attractive as they require only a single RGB camera. However, current methods rely on shape priors or CAD models of the intra-class known objects. We propose a diffusion-based monocular category-level 9D object pose generation method, MonoDiff9D. Our motivation is to leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models to alleviate the need for shape priors, CAD models, or depth sensors for intra-class unknown object pose estimation. We first estimate coarse depth via DINOv2 from the monocular image in a zero-shot manner and convert it into a point cloud. We then fuse the global features of the point cloud with the input image and use the fused features along with the encoded time step to condition MonoDiff9D. Finally, we design a transformer-based denoiser to recover the object pose from Gaussian noise. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets show that MonoDiff9D achieves state-of-the-art monocular category-level 9D object pose estimation accuracy without the need for shape priors or CAD models at any stage.

Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements.

However, most SOTA human mesh estimation (HME) models output a slightly different, thus inconsistent basic body shape for each video frame. Furthermore, we find that SOTA 3D human pose estimation (HPE) models outperform HME models regarding the precision of the estimated 3D keypoint positions. We solve the problem of inconsistent body shapes by leveraging anthropometric measurements like taken by tailors from humans. We create a model called A2B that converts given anthropometric measurements to basic body shape parameters of human mesh models. We obtain superior and consistent human meshes by combining the A2B model results with the keypoints of 3D HPE models using inverse kinematics. We evaluate our approach on challenging datasets like ASPset or fit3D, where we can lower the MPJPE by over 30 mm compared to SOTA HME models. Further, replacing estimates of the body shape parameters from existing HME models with A2B results not only increases the performance of these HME models, but also guarantees consistent body shapes.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for CVSports@CVPR'25</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient 2D to Full 3D Human Pose Uplifting including Joint Rotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09953v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sports analytics, accurately capturing both the 3D locations and rotations of body joints is essential for understanding an athlete's biomechanics. While Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) models can estimate joint rotations, they often exhibit lower accuracy in joint localization compared to 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) models. Recent work addressed this limitation by combining a 3D HPE model with inverse kinematics (IK) to estimate both joint locations and rotations. However, IK is computationally expensive. To overcome this, we propose a novel 2D-to-3D uplifting model that directly estimates 3D human poses, including joint rotations, in a single forward pass. We investigate multiple rotation representations, loss functions, and training strategies - both with and without access to ground truth rotations. Our models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in rotation estimation, are 150 times faster than the IK-based approach, and surpass HMR models in joint localization precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CVSports@CVPR'25</p></details> | None |

Conventional optical 3D sensors struggle to capture transparent objects, and machine learning methods are often hindered by their reliance on high-quality datasets. Leveraging NeRF's capability for continuous spatial opacity modeling, our proposed architecture integrates a NeRF-based approach for reconstructing the 3D information of transparent objects. Despite this, certain portions of the reconstructed 3D information may remain incomplete. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a shape-prior-driven completion mechanism, further refined by a geometric pose estimation method we have developed. This allows us to obtain a complete and reliable 3D information of transparent objects. Utilizing this refined data, we perform scene-level grasp prediction and deploy the results in real-world robotic systems. Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of our architecture, showcasing its capability to reliably capture 3D information of various transparent objects in cluttered scenes, and correspondingly, achieve high-quality, stables, and executable grasp predictions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EasyREG: Easy Depth-Based Markerless Registration and Tracking using Augmented Reality Device for Surgical Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09498v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Augmented Reality (AR) devices for surgical guidance has gained increasing traction in the medical field. Traditional registration methods often rely on external fiducial markers to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance. However, these markers introduce cumbersome calibration procedures and can be challenging to deploy in clinical settings. While commercial solutions have attempted real-time markerless tracking using the native RGB cameras of AR devices, their accuracy remains questionable for medical guidance, primarily due to occlusions and significant outliers between the live sensor data and the preoperative target anatomy point cloud derived from MRI or CT scans. In this work, we present a markerless framework that relies only on the depth sensor of AR devices and consists of two modules: a registration module for high-precision, outlier-robust target anatomy localization, and a tracking module for real-time pose estimation. The registration module integrates depth sensor error correction, a human-in-the-loop region filtering technique, and a robust global alignment with curvature-aware feature sampling, followed by local ICP refinement, for markerless alignment of preoperative models with patient anatomy. The tracking module employs a fast and robust registration algorithm that uses the initial pose from the registration module to estimate the target pose in real-time. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of both modules through simulation and real-world measurements. The results indicate that our markerless system achieves superior performance for registration and comparable performance for tracking to industrial solutions. The two-module design makes our system a one-stop solution for surgical procedures where the target anatomy moves or stays static during surgery.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel computational imaging framework that overcomes these obstacles by integrating a hybrid image pre-processing pipeline with a joint pose estimation and 3D reconstruction module based on controlled Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Branch-and-Bound (BnB) search. We validate our approach on both synthetic satellite datasets and on-sky observations of China's Tiangong Space Station and the International Space Station, achieving robust 3D reconstructions of low-Earth orbit satellites from ground-based data. Quantitative evaluations using SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and Chamfer Distance demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based approaches, and ablation studies confirm the critical role of each component.

While existing methods predominantly operate on RGB images, we propose a novel network that directly processes raw images, bypassing the need for the Image Signal Processor (ISP). This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations. This work represents the first attempt to develop a keypoint detection and feature description network specifically for raw images, offering a more efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Most recent 6D object pose methods rely on refinement to get accurate results. However, most existing refinement methods either suffer from noises in establishing correspondences, or rely on retraining for novel objects. SCFlow2 is based on the SCFlow model designed for refinement with shape constraint, but formulates the additional depth as a regularization in the iteration via 3D scene flow for RGBD frames. The key design of SCFlow2 is an introduction of geometry constraints into the training of recurrent matching network, by combining the rigid-motion embeddings in 3D scene flow and 3D shape prior of the target. We train SCFlow2 on a combination of dataset Objaverse, GSO and ShapeNet, and evaluate on BOP datasets with novel objects. After using our method as a post-processing, most state-of-the-art methods produce significantly better results, without any retraining or fine-tuning.

Typically, the initialization is taken from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms; however, SfM is time-consuming and restricts the application of 3DGS in real-world scenarios and large-scale scene reconstruction. We introduce a constrained optimization method for simultaneous camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction that does not require SfM support. Core to our approach is decomposing a camera pose into a sequence of camera-to-(device-)center and (device-)center-to-world optimizations. To facilitate, we propose two optimization constraints conditioned to the sensitivity of each parameter group and restricts each parameter's search space. In addition, as we learn the scene geometry directly from the noisy point clouds, we propose geometric constraints to improve the reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing (multi-modal) 3DGS baseline and methods supplemented by COLMAP on both our collected dataset and two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite recent advances, there is no comprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction reconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown object are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited hand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one hand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction exhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands and an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D Gaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an unknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians avoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct unseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model (i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively accumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D alignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects optimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose estimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[The Invisible EgoHand: 3D Hand Forecasting through EgoBody Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08654v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting hand motion and pose from an egocentric perspective is essential for understanding human intention. However, existing methods focus solely on predicting positions without considering articulation, and only when the hands are visible in the field of view. This limitation overlooks the fact that approximate hand positions can still be inferred even when they are outside the camera's view. In this paper, we propose a method to forecast the 3D trajectories and poses of both hands from an egocentric video, both in and out of the field of view. We propose a diffusion-based transformer architecture for Egocentric Hand Forecasting, EgoH4, which takes as input the observation sequence and camera poses, then predicts future 3D motion and poses for both hands of the camera wearer. We leverage full-body pose information, allowing other joints to provide constraints on hand motion. We denoise the hand and body joints along with a visibility predictor for hand joints and a 3D-to-2D reprojection loss that minimizes the error when hands are in-view. We evaluate EgoH4 on the Ego-Exo4D dataset, combining subsets with body and hand annotations. We train on 156K sequences and evaluate on 34K sequences, respectively. EgoH4 improves the performance by 3.4cm and 5.1cm over the baseline in terms of ADE for hand trajectory forecasting and MPJPE for hand pose forecasting.

Unlike human-robot interaction, which benefits from established datasets and frameworks, animal-robot interaction lacks the foundational resources needed to facilitate meaningful bidirectional communication. To bridge this gap, we present the MBE-ARI (Multimodal Bidirectional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction), a novel multimodal dataset that captures detailed interactions between a legged robot and cows. The dataset includes synchronized RGB-D streams from multiple viewpoints, annotated with body pose and activity labels across interaction phases, offering an unprecedented level of detail for ARI research. Additionally, we introduce a full-body pose estimation model tailored for quadruped animals, capable of tracking 39 keypoints with a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.7%, outperforming existing benchmarks in animal pose estimation.

Their novelty compared to standard cameras lies in the transition from capturing full picture frames at fixed time intervals to a sparse data format which, with its distinctive qualities, offers potential improvements in various applications. However, these advantages come at the cost of reinventing algorithmic procedures or adapting them to effectively process the new data format. In this survey, we systematically examine neuromorphic vision along three main dimensions. First, we highlight the technological evolution and distinctive hardware features of neuromorphic cameras from their inception to recent models. Second, we review image processing algorithms developed explicitly for event-based data, covering key works on feature detection, tracking, and optical flow -which form the basis for analyzing image elements and transformations -as well as depth and pose estimation or object recognition, which interpret more complex scene structures and components. These techniques, drawn from classical computer vision and modern data-driven approaches, are examined to illustrate the breadth of applications for event-based cameras. Third, we present practical application case studies demonstrating how event cameras have been successfully used across various industries and scenarios. Finally, we analyze the challenges limiting widespread adoption, identify significant research gaps compared to standard imaging techniques, and outline promising future directions and opportunities that neuromorphic vision offers.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages total, 26 without references, two images and five tables.

Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) has emerged as a promising solution due to its resilience in such environments. In this paper, we present RINO, a non-iterative RIO framework implemented in an adaptively loosely coupled manner. Building upon ORORA as the baseline for radar odometry, RINO introduces several key advancements, including improvements in keypoint extraction, motion distortion compensation, and pose estimation via an adaptive voting mechanism. This voting strategy facilitates efficient polynomial-time optimization while simultaneously quantifying the uncertainty in the radar module's pose estimation. The estimated uncertainty is subsequently integrated into the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation within a Kalman filter framework. Unlike prior loosely coupled odometry systems, RINO not only retains the global and robust registration capabilities of the radar component but also dynamically accounts for the real-time operational state of each sensor during fusion. Experimental results conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that RINO reduces translation and rotation errors by 1.06% and 0.09{\deg}/100m, respectively, when compared to the baseline method, thus significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, RINO achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing pose datasets often simplify the spine to a single rigid segment, overlooking the nuanced articulation required for accurate motion analysis. In contrast, SpineTrack annotates nine detailed spinal keypoints across two complementary subsets: a synthetic set comprising 25k annotations created using Unreal Engine with biomechanical alignment through OpenSim, and a real-world set comprising over 33k annotations curated via an active learning pipeline that iteratively refines automated annotations with human feedback. This integrated approach ensures anatomically consistent labels at scale, even for challenging, in-the-wild images. We further introduce SpinePose, extending state-of-the-art body pose estimators using knowledge distillation and an anatomical regularization strategy to jointly predict body and spine keypoints. Our experiments in both general and sports-specific contexts validate the effectiveness of SpineTrack for precise spine pose estimation, establishing a robust foundation for future research in advanced biomechanical analysis and 3D spine reconstruction in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in CVPRW 2025</p></details> | None |

To overcome these limitations, we introduce corner points of the object bounding box as an intermediate representation of the object pose. The 3D object corners can be reliably recovered from sparse input views, while the 2D corner points in the target view are estimated through a novel reference-based point synthesizer, which works well even in scenarios involving occlusions. As object semantic points, object corners naturally establish 2D-3D correspondences for object pose estimation with a PnP algorithm.

A particular focus in computer-assisted surgery is to replace marker-based tracking systems for instrument localization with pure image-based 6DoF pose estimation using deep-learning methods. However, state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation methods do not yet meet the accuracy required for surgical navigation. In this context, we investigate the benefits of multi-view setups for highly accurate and occlusion-robust 6DoF pose estimation of surgical instruments and derive recommendations for an ideal camera system that addresses the challenges in the operating room. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we present a multi-camera capture setup consisting of static and head-mounted cameras, which allows us to study the performance of pose estimation methods under various camera configurations. Second, we publish a multi-view RGB-D video dataset of ex-vivo spine surgeries, captured in a surgical wet lab and a real operating theatre and including rich annotations for surgeon, instrument, and patient anatomy. Third, we evaluate three state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view methods for the task of 6DoF pose estimation of surgical instruments and analyze the influence of camera configurations, training data, and occlusions on the pose accuracy and generalization ability. The best method utilizes five cameras in a multi-view pose optimization and achieves an average position and orientation error of 1.01 mm and 0.89{\deg} for a surgical drill as well as 2.79 mm and 3.33{\deg} for a screwdriver under optimal conditions.

It is well studied for optical cameras, but research is lacking for 2D forward-looking sonar (FLS) in underwater scenarios due to the vastly different imaging principles. In this paper, we demonstrate that, despite the nonlinearity inherent in sonar image formation, the P$n$P problem for 2D FLS can still be effectively addressed within a point-to-line (PtL) 3D registration paradigm through orthographic approximation. The registration is then resolved by a duality-based optimal solver, ensuring the global optimality. For coplanar cases, a null space analysis is conducted to retrieve the solutions from the dual formulation, enabling the methods to be applied to more general cases. Extensive simulations have been conducted to systematically evaluate the performance under different settings. Compared to non-reprojection-optimized state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed approach achieves significantly higher precision.

The latter assumes comprehensive geometric coverage during the training phase. However, the data-driven approach is typically biased toward tabletop scenarios and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios with larger objects (e.g. chair). Additionally, raw sensor data (e.g. RGB-D data) from a single view of these larger objects is often incomplete and necessitates additional observations. In this paper, we take a geometric approach, leveraging advancements in object modeling (e.g. NeRF) to build an implicit model by taking RGB images from views around the target object. This model enables the extraction of explicit mesh model while also capturing the visual appearance from novel viewpoints that is useful for perception tasks like object detection and pose estimation. We further decompose the NeRF-reconstructed 3D mesh into superquadrics (SQs) -- parametric geometric primitives, each mapped to a set of precomputed grasp poses, allowing grasp composition on the target object based on these primitives. Our proposed pipeline overcomes the problems: a) noisy depth and incomplete view of the object, with a modeling step, and b) generalization to objects of any size.

DLTPose predicts per-pixel radial distances to a set of minimally four keypoints, which are then fed into our novel Direct Linear Transform (DLT) formulation to produce accurate 3D object frame surface estimates, leading to better 6DoF pose estimation. Additionally, we introduce a novel symmetry-aware keypoint ordering approach, designed to handle object symmetries that otherwise cause inconsistencies in keypoint assignments. Previous keypoint-based methods relied on fixed keypoint orderings, which failed to account for the multiple valid configurations exhibited by symmetric objects, which our ordering approach exploits to enhance the model's ability to learn stable keypoint representations. Extensive experiments on the benchmark LINEMOD, Occlusion LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets show that DLTPose outperforms existing methods, especially for symmetric and occluded objects, demonstrating superior Mean Average Recall values of 86.5% (LM), 79.7% (LM-O) and 89.5% (YCB-V).

Compared to previous shape assembly methods, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 18 tasks in the 2BY2 dataset. Additionally, robot experiments further validate the reliability and generalization ability of our method for complex 3D assembly tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 (Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)</p></details> | None |

While benchmark datasets have significantly advanced deep learning methods, they mainly focus on simplistic scenes with light occlusion and insufficient diversity, limiting their applicability to practical scenarios. We present GraspClutter6D, a large-scale real-world grasping dataset featuring: (1) 1,000 highly cluttered scenes with dense arrangements (14.1 objects/scene, 62.6\% occlusion), (2) comprehensive coverage across 200 objects in 75 environment configurations (bins, shelves, and tables) captured using four RGB-D cameras from multiple viewpoints, and (3) rich annotations including 736K 6D object poses and 9.3B feasible robotic grasps for 52K RGB-D images. We benchmark state-of-the-art segmentation, object pose estimation, and grasping detection methods to provide key insights into challenges in cluttered environments. Additionally, we validate the dataset's effectiveness as a training resource, demonstrating that grasping networks trained on GraspClutter6D significantly outperform those trained on existing datasets in both simulation and real-world experiments.

However, existing AR systems require expert supervision and do not account for differences in the mentor and mentee robot configurations. To enable novices to train outside the operating room while receiving expert-informed guidance, we present dV-STEAR: an open-source system that plays back task-aligned expert demonstrations without assuming identical setup joint positions between expert and novice. Pose estimation was rigorously quantified, showing a registration error of 3.86 (SD=2.01)mm. In a user study (N=24), dV-STEAR significantly improved novice performance on tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. In a single-handed ring-over-wire task, dV-STEAR increased completion speed (p=0.03) and reduced collision time (p=0.01) compared to dry-lab training alone. During a pick-and-place task, it improved success rates (p=0.004). Across both tasks, participants using dV-STEAR exhibited significantly more balanced hand use and reported lower frustration levels. This work presents a novel educational tool implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, demonstrates its effectiveness in teaching novices, and builds the foundation for further AR integration into robot-assisted surgery.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures; Open-source code, see https://github.com/AlexandreBanks6/dV-STEAR_Public.git; Supplementary movies, see https://github.com/AlexandreBanks6/dVSTEAR_Supplemental_Files.git</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/AlexandreBanks6/dV-STEAR_Public.git) |

While existing approaches primarily aim to enhance the performance of estimated 2D poses, they often struggle when applied to ground-truth 2D pose data. We observe that achieving accurate 3D pose reconstruction from ground-truth 2D poses requires precise modeling of local pose structures, alongside the ability to extract robust global spatio-temporal features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Hyper-GCN and Shuffle Mamba (HGMamba) block, which processes input data through two parallel streams: Hyper-GCN and Shuffle-Mamba. The Hyper-GCN stream models the human body structure as hypergraphs with varying levels of granularity to effectively capture local joint dependencies. Meanwhile, the Shuffle Mamba stream leverages a state space model to perform spatio-temporal scanning across all joints, enabling the establishment of global dependencies. By adaptively fusing these two representations, HGMamba achieves strong global feature modeling while excelling at local structure modeling. We stack multiple HGMamba blocks to create three variants of our model, allowing users to select the most suitable configuration based on the desired speed-accuracy trade-off. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. HGMamba-B achieves state-of-the-art results, with P1 errors of 38.65 mm and 14.33 mm on the respective datasets.

Despite significant progress in pose estimation algorithms targeting adults, such developments for infants remain limited. Existing algorithms for infant pose estimation, despite achieving commendable performance, depend on fully supervised approaches that require large amounts of labeled data. These algorithms also struggle with poor generalizability under distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce SHIFT: Leveraging SyntHetic Adult Datasets for Unsupervised InFanT Pose Estimation, which leverages the pseudo-labeling-based Mean-Teacher framework to compensate for the lack of labeled data and addresses distribution shifts by enforcing consistency between the student and the teacher pseudo-labels. Additionally, to penalize implausible predictions obtained from the mean-teacher framework, we incorporate an infant manifold pose prior. To enhance SHIFT's self-occlusion perception ability, we propose a novel visibility consistency module for improved alignment of the predicted poses with the original image. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that SHIFT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) pose estimation methods by 5% and supervised infant pose estimation methods by a margin of 16%.

These factors generate difficulties in the accurate recognition of human intentions and the generation of comfortable, socially aware trajectories. To address these issues, we propose SAP-CoPE, a social-aware planning framework that integrates cooperative infrastructure with a novel 3D human pose estimation method and a model predictive control-based controller. This real-time framework formulates an optimization problem that accounts for uncertainty propagation in the camera projection matrix while ensuring human joint coherence. The proposed method is adaptable to single- or multi-camera configurations and can incorporate sparse LiDAR point-cloud data. To enhance safety and comfort in human environments, we integrate a human personal space field based on human pose into a model predictive controller, enabling the system to navigate while avoiding discomfort zones. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating socially aware trajectories for autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics</p></details> | None |

Furthermore, the matching module explicitly models object motion, enabling the tracking of specific targets and advancing motion understanding in complex scenarios. Recently, the proposed representation of pointmap in DUSt3R suggests a potential solution to unify both geometry estimation and matching in 3D space, but it still struggles with ambiguous matching in dynamic regions, which may hamper further improvement. In this work, we present POMATO, a unified framework for dynamic 3D reconstruction by marrying pointmap matching with temporal motion. Specifically, our method first learns an explicit matching relationship by mapping RGB pixels from both dynamic and static regions across different views to 3D pointmaps within a unified coordinate system. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal motion module for dynamic motions that ensures scale consistency across different frames and enhances performance in tasks requiring both precise geometry and reliable matching, most notably 3D point tracking. We show the effectiveness of the proposed pointmap matching and temporal fusion paradigm by demonstrating the remarkable performance across multiple downstream tasks, including video depth estimation, 3D point tracking, and pose estimation.

Many MDE models aim to predict affine-invariant relative depth from monocular images, while recent developments in large-scale training and vision foundation models enable reasonable estimation of metric (absolute) depth. However, effectively leveraging these predictions for geometric vision tasks, in particular relative pose estimation, remains relatively under explored. While depths provide rich constraints for cross-view image alignment, the intrinsic noise and ambiguity from the monocular depth priors present practical challenges to improving upon classic keypoint-based solutions. In this paper, we develop three solvers for relative pose estimation that explicitly account for independent affine (scale and shift) ambiguities, covering both calibrated and uncalibrated conditions. We further propose a hybrid estimation pipeline that combines our proposed solvers with classic point-based solvers and epipolar constraints. We find that the affine correction modeling is beneficial to not only the relative depth priors but also, surprisingly, the "metric" ones. Results across multiple datasets demonstrate large improvements of our approach over classic keypoint-based baselines and PnP-based solutions, under both calibrated and uncalibrated setups. We also show that our method improves consistently with different feature matchers and MDE models, and can further benefit from very recent advances on both modules.

For instance, DUSt3R recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction and showing that all key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes can be reduced to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem: the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image-one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object and the other to a canonical version of the object in its rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction to recover the complete shape of the object, even through self-occlusions. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation can be reduced to the prediction of DualPMs. Empirically, we demonstrate that this representation is a suitable target for deep networks to predict. Specifically, we focus on modeling quadrupeds, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on synthetic 3D data, consisting of one or two models per category, while generalizing effectively to real images. With this approach, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of such objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

This approach heavily relies on the visual matching across frames. However, ambiguous matching in challenging scenarios leads to significant errors in geometric modeling and bundle adjustment optimization, which undermines the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes MambaVO, which conducts robust initialization, Mamba-based sequential matching refinement, and smoothed training to enhance the matching quality and improve the pose estimation. Specifically, the new frame is matched with the closest keyframe in the maintained Point-Frame Graph (PFG) via the semi-dense based Geometric Initialization Module (GIM). Then the initialized PFG is processed by a proposed Geometric Mamba Module (GMM), which exploits the matching features to refine the overall inter-frame matching. The refined PFG is finally processed by differentiable BA to optimize the poses and the map. To deal with the gradient variance, a Trending-Aware Penalty (TAP) is proposed to smooth training and enhance convergence and stability. A loop closure module is finally applied to enable MambaVO++. On public benchmarks, MambaVO and MambaVO++ demonstrate SOTA performance, while ensuring real-time running.</p></details> |  | None |

By reformulating the vehicle's dynamics and measurement models within a linear time-varying (LTV) framework, we enable the application of a linear Kalman filter, significantly simplifying observer design for inertial navigation systems (INS). A key strength of this approach lies in its generality: rather than relying on specific measurement modalities, our framework accommodates a broad class of exteroceptive measurements. To illustrate its effectiveness, we conduct a uniform observability (UO) analysis for two fundamental benchmark cases-GPS-aided INS and landmark-aided INS-deriving sufficient conditions that guarantee the global uniform exponential stability of the proposed filter. Simulations for both applications confirm the versatility and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Similar to the standard camera, the event camera requires precise intrinsic calibration to facilitate further high-level visual applications, such as pose estimation and mapping. While several calibration methods for event cameras have been proposed, most of them are either (i) engineering-driven, heavily relying on conventional image-based calibration pipelines, or (ii) inconvenient, requiring complex instrumentation. To this end, we propose an accurate and convenient intrinsic calibration method for event cameras, named eKalibr, which builds upon a carefully designed event-based circle grid pattern recognition algorithm. To extract target patterns from events, we perform event-based normal flow estimation to identify potential events generated by circle edges, and cluster them spatially. Subsequently, event clusters associated with the same grid circles are matched and grouped using normal flows, for subsequent time-varying ellipse estimation. Fitted ellipse centers are time-synchronized, for final grid pattern recognition. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of eKalibr in terms of pattern extraction and intrinsic calibration. The implementation of eKalibr is open-sourced at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) |

These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a matching-aware pose estimation network and a depth refinement module to enhance geometry consistency across views, ensuring more accurate and stable 3D reconstructions. To present the performance of our method, we evaluated it on large-scale real-world datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV.

Although recent SfM pipelines have made impressive progress, questions remain about how to further improve both their robust performance in challenging conditions (e.g., textureless scenes) and the precision of camera parameter estimation simultaneously. We present 3R-GS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges this gap by jointly optimizing 3D Gaussians and camera parameters from large reconstruction priors MASt3R-SfM. We note that naively performing joint 3D Gaussian and camera optimization faces two challenges: the sensitivity to the quality of SfM initialization, and its limited capacity for global optimization, leading to suboptimal reconstruction results. Our 3R-GS, overcomes these issues by incorporating optimized practices, enabling robust scene reconstruction even with imperfect camera registration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3R-GS delivers high-quality novel view synthesis and precise camera pose estimation while remaining computationally efficient.

Our method first assigns body part labels to individual points, which then guide a two-step SMPL-X fitting: initial pose and orientation estimation using body part centroids, followed by global refinement of the point cloud alignment. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fitted human mesh can refine body part labels, leading to improved segmentation.

Existing works on LiDAR BA usually rely on predefined geometric features for landmark representation. This reliance restricts generalizability, as the system will inevitably deteriorate in environments where these specific features are absent. To address this issue, we propose SGBA, a LiDAR BA scheme that models the environment as a semantic Gaussian mixture model (GMM) without predefined feature types. This approach encodes both geometric and semantic information, offering a comprehensive and general representation adaptable to various environments. Additionally, to limit computational complexity while ensuring generalizability, we propose an adaptive semantic selection framework that selects the most informative semantic clusters for optimization by evaluating the condition number of the cost function. Lastly, we introduce a probabilistic feature association scheme that considers the entire probability density of assignments, which can manage uncertainties in measurement and initial pose estimation. We have conducted various experiments and the results demonstrate that SGBA can achieve accurate and robust pose refinement even in challenging scenarios with low-quality initial pose estimation and limited geometric features.

However, achieving scale-consistent reconstruction remains an open challenge due to inherent issues in endoscopic videos, such as dynamic deformations and textureless surfaces. Despite recent advances, current methods either rely on calibration or instrument priors to estimate scale, or employ SfM-like multi-stage pipelines, leading to error accumulation and requiring offline optimization. In this paper, we present Endo3R, a unified 3D foundation model for online scale-consistent reconstruction from monocular surgical video, without any priors or extra optimization. Our model unifies the tasks by predicting globally aligned pointmaps, scale-consistent video depths, and camera parameters without any offline optimization. The core contribution of our method is expanding the capability of the recent pairwise reconstruction model to long-term incremental dynamic reconstruction by an uncertainty-aware dual memory mechanism. The mechanism maintains history tokens of both short-term dynamics and long-term spatial consistency. Notably, to tackle the highly dynamic nature of surgical scenes, we measure the uncertainty of tokens via Sampson distance and filter out tokens with high uncertainty. Regarding the scarcity of endoscopic datasets with ground-truth depth and camera poses, we further devise a self-supervised mechanism with a novel dynamics-aware flow loss. Abundant experiments on SCARED and Hamlyn datasets demonstrate our superior performance in zero-shot surgical video depth prediction and camera pose estimation with online efficiency.

To address this issue, this study proposes a novel cooperative inference method for real-time 3D human pose estimation in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. In the proposed method, multiple end devices equipped with lightweight inference models employ dual confidence thresholds to filter ambiguous images. Only the filtered images are offloaded to an edge server with a more powerful inference model for re-evaluation, thereby improving the estimation accuracy under computational and communication constraints. We numerically analyze the performance of the proposed inference method in terms of the inference accuracy and end-to-end delay and formulate a joint optimization problem to derive the optimal confidence thresholds and transmission time for each device, with the objective of minimizing the mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) while satisfying the required end-to-end delay constraint. To solve this problem, we demonstrate that minimizing the MPJPE is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the inference accuracies for all devices, decompose the problem into manageable subproblems, and present a low-complexity optimization algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution. The experimental results show that a trade-off exists between the MPJPE and end-to-end delay depending on the confidence thresholds. Furthermore, the results confirm that the proposed cooperative inference method achieves a significant reduction in the MPJPE through the optimal selection of confidence thresholds and transmission times, while consistently satisfying the end-to-end delay requirement in various MEC environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures | None |

In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks, each defined by a task, object onboarding setup, and dataset group. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 25X faster and 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have a similar ranking on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still noticealy (-53%) behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023).

In this paper, we introduce PicoPose, a novel framework designed to tackle this task using a three-stage pixel-to-pixel correspondence learning process. Firstly, PicoPose matches features from the RGB observation with those from rendered object templates, identifying the best-matched template and establishing coarse correspondences. Secondly, PicoPose smooths the correspondences by globally regressing a 2D affine transformation, including in-plane rotation, scale, and 2D translation, from the coarse correspondence map. Thirdly, PicoPose applies the affine transformation to the feature map of the best-matched template and learns correspondence offsets within local regions to achieve fine-grained correspondences. By progressively refining the correspondences, PicoPose significantly improves the accuracy of object poses computed via PnP/RANSAC. PicoPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on the seven core datasets of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating exceptional generalization to novel objects represented by CAD models or object reference images.

In particular, we are interested in answering the question whether using MDEs improves results over traditional point-based methods. We propose a novel framework for estimating the relative pose of two cameras from point correspondences with associated monocular depths. Since depth predictions are typically defined up to an unknown scale or even both unknown scale and shift parameters, our solvers jointly estimate the scale or both the scale and shift parameters along with the relative pose. We derive efficient solvers considering different types of depths for three camera configurations: (1) two calibrated cameras, (2) two cameras with an unknown shared focal length, and (3) two cameras with unknown different focal lengths. Our new solvers outperform state-of-the-art depth-aware solvers in terms of speed and accuracy. In extensive real experiments on multiple datasets and with various MDEs, we discuss which depth-aware solvers are preferable in which situation. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 18 pages | None |

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  | None |

Monocular 3D human pose estimation is challenged by depth ambiguity, limited 3D-labeled training data, imbalanced modeling, and restricted model generalization. To address these limitations, our work introduces a groundbreaking motion pre-training method based on contextualized representation learning. Specifically, our method involves masking 2D pose features and utilizing a Transformer-GCN dual-stream model to learn high-dimensional representations through a self-distillation setup. By focusing on contextualized representation learning and spatial-temporal modeling, our approach enhances the model's ability to understand spatial-temporal relationships between postures, resulting in superior generalization. Furthermore, leveraging the Transformer-GCN dual-stream model, our approach effectively balances global and local interactions in video pose estimation. The model adaptively integrates information from both the Transformer and GCN streams, where the GCN stream effectively learns local relationships between adjacent key points and frames, while the Transformer stream captures comprehensive global spatial and temporal features. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, with an MPJPE of 38.0mm and P-MPJPE of 31.9mm on Human3.6M, and an MPJPE of 15.9mm on MPI-INF-3DHP. Furthermore, visual experiments on public datasets and in-the-wild videos demonstrate the robustness and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

By embedding the original state space, $\so \times \R^3 \times \R^3$, within the higher-dimensional Lie group $\sefive$, we reformulate the vehicle dynamics and outputs within a structured, geometric framework. In particular, this embedding enables a decoupling of the resulting geometric error dynamics: the translational error dynamics follow a structure similar to the error dynamics of a continuous-time Kalman filter, which allows for a time-varying gain design using the Riccati equation. Under the condition of uniform observability, we establish that the proposed observer design on $\sefive$ guarantees almost global asymptotic stability. We validate the approach in simulations for two practical scenarios: stereo-aided inertial navigation systems (INS) and GPS-aided INS. The proposed method significantly simplifies the design of nonlinear geometric observers for INS, providing a generalized and robust approach to state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.03846</p></details> | None |

To address these challenges, we introduce ForestGlue, enhancing the SuperPoint feature detector through four configurations - grayscale, RGB, RGB-D, and stereo-vision - optimised for various sensing modalities. For feature matching, we employ LightGlue or SuperGlue, retrained with synthetic forest data. ForestGlue achieves comparable pose estimation accuracy to baseline models but requires only 512 keypoints - just 25% of the baseline's 2048 - to reach an LO-RANSAC AUC score of 0.745 at a 10{\deg} threshold. With only a quarter of keypoints needed, ForestGlue significantly reduces computational overhead, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic forest environments, and making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. By combining ForestGlue with a transformer-based pose estimation model, we propose ForestVO, which estimates relative camera poses using matched 2D pixel coordinates between frames. On challenging TartanAir forest sequences, ForestVO achieves an average relative pose error (RPE) of 1.09 m and a kitti_score of 2.33%, outperforming direct-based methods like DSO by 40% in dynamic scenes. Despite using only 10% of the dataset for training, ForestVO maintains competitive performance with TartanVO while being a significantly lighter model. This work establishes an end-to-end deep learning pipeline specifically tailored for visual odometry in forested environments, leveraging forest-specific training data to optimise feature correspondence and pose estimation, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of autonomous navigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> | None |

By utilizing generic exteroceptive measurements in combination with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), we reformulate the vehicle's dynamics and outputs to fit within a linear time-varying (LTV) framework. This transformation enables the application of a linear continuous-time Kalman filter, thereby avoiding the complexities of nonlinear estimators and local Kalman-type filtering methods (e.g., EKF). We perform a complete uniform observability analysis for key benchmark problems (e.g., GPS-INS and Landmark-INS) and derive sufficient conditions for ensuring global uniform exponential stability. Simulations are conducted for two practical applications: stereo-aided inertial navigation systems (INS) with both constant and time-varying gains, as well as GPS-aided INS. The proposed approach notably simplifies observer design for INS.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages motion blur as a rich cue for motion estimation rather than treating it as an unwanted artifact. Our approach works by predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map directly from a single motion-blurred image. We then recover the instantaneous camera velocity by solving a linear least squares problem under the small motion assumption. In essence, our method produces an IMU-like measurement that robustly captures fast and aggressive camera movements. To train our model, we construct a large-scale dataset with realistic synthetic motion blur derived from ScanNet++v2 and further refine our model by training end-to-end on real data using our fully differentiable pipeline. Extensive evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art angular and translational velocity estimates, outperforming current methods like MASt3R and COLMAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jerredchen.github.io/image-as-imu/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://jerredchen.github.io/image-as-imu) |

Despite notable progress in some existing approaches, our study reveals that the scarcity of high-quality datasets remains a significant bottleneck, limiting the full potential of current methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Controllable Image Generation Pipeline for synthesizing animal pose estimation data, termed AP-CAP. Within this pipeline, we introduce a Multi-Modal Animal Image Generation Model capable of producing images with expected poses. To enhance the quality and diversity of the generated data, we further propose three innovative strategies: (1) Modality-Fusion-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to integrate multi-source appearance representations, (2) Pose-Adjustment-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to dynamically capture diverse pose variations, and (3) Caption-Enhancement-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to enrich visual semantic understanding. Leveraging the proposed model and strategies, we create the MPCH Dataset (Modality-Pose-Caption Hybrid), the first hybrid dataset that innovatively combines synthetic and real data, establishing the largest-scale multi-source heterogeneous benchmark repository for animal pose estimation to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in improving both the performance and generalization capability of animal pose estimators.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets.

For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths.

We extract keypoints from the reference image and generate a 3D reference map with 3D reconstruction of the keypoints in advance. We emphasize that the more keypoints in the 3D reference map and the smaller the error of the 3D positions of the keypoints, the higher the accuracy of the camera pose estimation. However, previous image-only methods require a huge number of images, and it is difficult to 3D-reconstruct keypoints without error due to inevitable mismatches and failures in feature matching. As a result, the 3D reference map is sparse and inaccurate. In contrast, accurate 3D reference maps can be generated by combining images and 3D sensors. Recently, 3D-LiDAR has been widely used around the world. LiDAR, which measures a large space with high density, has become inexpensive. In addition, accurately calibrated cameras are also widely used, so images that record the external parameters of the camera without errors can be easily obtained. In this paper, we propose a method to directly assign 3D LiDAR point clouds to keypoints to generate dense and accurate 3D reference maps. The proposed method avoids feature matching and achieves accurate 3D reconstruction for almost all keypoints. To estimate camera pose over a wide area, we use the wide-area LiDAR point cloud to remove points that are not visible to the camera and reduce 2D-3D correspondence errors. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we apply the proposed method to several state-of-the-art local features and confirm that it improves the accuracy of camera pose estimation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

In indoor environments, traditional Monte Carlo localization based on occupancy grid maps is considered the gold standard, but its accuracy is limited by the representation capabilities of the occupancy grid map. In this paper, we address the problem of building an effective map representation that allows to accurately perform probabilistic global localization. To this end, we propose an implicit neural map representation that is able to capture positional and directional geometric features from 2D LiDAR scans to efficiently represent the environment and learn a neural network that is able to predict both, the non-projective signed distance and a direction-aware projective distance for an arbitrary point in the mapped environment. This combination of neural map representation with a light-weight neural network allows us to design an efficient observation model within a conventional Monte Carlo localization framework for pose estimation of a robot in real time. We evaluated our approach to indoor localization on a publicly available dataset for global localization and the experimental results indicate that our approach is able to more accurately localize a mobile robot than other localization approaches employing occupancy or existing neural map representations. In contrast to other approaches employing an implicit neural map representation for 2D LiDAR localization, our approach allows to perform real-time pose tracking after convergence and near real-time global localization.

Modern global localization techniques often depend on dense LiDAR maps, which, while precise, require extensive storage and computational resources. Recent approaches have explored alternative methods, such as sparse maps and learned features, but they suffer from poor robustness and generalization. We propose SparseLoc, a global localization framework that leverages vision-language foundation models to generate sparse, semantic-topometric maps in a zero-shot manner. It combines this map representation with a Monte Carlo localization scheme enhanced by a novel late optimization strategy, ensuring improved pose estimation. By constructing compact yet highly discriminative maps and refining localization through a carefully designed optimization schedule, SparseLoc overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, offering a more efficient and robust solution for global localization. Our system achieves over a 5X improvement in localization accuracy compared to existing sparse mapping techniques. Despite utilizing only 1/500th of the points of dense mapping methods, it achieves comparable performance, maintaining an average global localization error below 5m and 2 degrees on KITTI sequences.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we argue that these methods ignore the limitation of the sparse skeleton 2D input representation, which fundamentally restricts the 2D-to-3D lifting and worsens the occlusion issue. To address these, we propose a novel two-stage generative densification method, named Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer (HiPART), to generate hierarchical 2D dense poses from the original sparse 2D pose. Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale skeleton tokenization module to quantize the highly dense 2D pose into hierarchical tokens and propose a Skeleton-aware Alignment to strengthen token connections. We then develop a Hierarchical AutoRegressive Modeling scheme for hierarchical 2D pose generation. With generated hierarchical poses as inputs for 2D-to-3D lifting, the proposed method shows strong robustness in occluded scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-frame-based 3D HPE. Moreover, it outperforms numerous multi-frame methods while reducing parameter and computational complexity and can also complement them to further enhance performance and robustness.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |

However, patients' engagement tends to decrease over time without direct supervision, which is why there is a need for an automated monitoring system. In recent years, there has been great progress in quality assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises. Most of them only provide a binary classification if the performance is correct or incorrect, and a few provide a continuous score. This information is not sufficient for patients to improve their performance. In this work, we propose an algorithm for error classification of rehabilitation exercises, thus making the first step toward more detailed feedback to patients. We focus on skeleton-based exercise assessment, which utilizes human pose estimation to evaluate motion. Inspired by recent algorithms for quality assessment during rehabilitation exercises, we propose a Transformer-based model for the described classification. Our model is inspired by the HyperFormer method for human action recognition, and adapted to our problem and dataset. The evaluation is done on the KERAAL dataset, as it is the only medical dataset with clear error labels for the exercises, and our model significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we bridge the gap towards better feedback to the patients by presenting a way to calculate the importance of joints for each exercise.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICORR...</summary><p>ICORR 2025 - 19th IEEE/RAS-EMBS International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics, INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM FOR REHABILITATION ROBOTICS, May 2025, Michigan, USA, United States</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods depend on specialized equipment such as force plates and sensors, which makes accurate assessments both expensive and restricted to laboratory settings. In this paper, we introduce ForcePose, a novel deep learning framework that estimates applied forces by combining human pose estimation with object detection. Our approach leverages MediaPipe for skeletal tracking and SSD MobileNet for object recognition to create a unified representation of human-object interaction. We've developed a specialized neural network that processes both spatial and temporal features to predict force magnitude and direction without needing any physical sensors. After training on our dataset of 850 annotated videos with corresponding force measurements, our model achieves a mean absolute error of 5.83 N in force magnitude and 7.4 degrees in force direction. When compared to existing computer vision approaches, our method performs 27.5% better while still offering real-time performance on standard computing hardware. ForcePose opens up new possibilities for force analysis in diverse real-world scenarios where traditional measurement tools are impractical or intrusive.

| **[GCRayDiffusion: Pose-Free Surface Reconstruction via Geometric Consistent Ray Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22349v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate surface reconstruction from unposed images is crucial for efficient 3D object or scene creation. However, it remains challenging, particularly for the joint camera pose estimation. Previous approaches have achieved impressive pose-free surface reconstruction results in dense-view settings, but could easily fail for sparse-view scenarios without sufficient visual overlap. In this paper, we propose a new technique for pose-free surface reconstruction, which follows triplane-based signed distance field (SDF) learning but regularizes the learning by explicit points sampled from ray-based diffusion of camera pose estimation. Our key contribution is a novel Geometric Consistent Ray Diffusion model (GCRayDiffusion), where we represent camera poses as neural bundle rays and regress the distribution of noisy rays via a diffusion model. More importantly, we further condition the denoising process of RGRayDiffusion using the triplane-based SDF of the entire scene, which provides effective 3D consistent regularization to achieve multi-view consistent camera pose estimation. Finally, we incorporate RGRayDiffusion into the triplane-based SDF learning by introducing on-surface geometric regularization from the sampling points of the neural bundle rays, which leads to highly accurate pose-free surface reconstruction results even for sparse-view inputs. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that our GCRayDiffusion achieves more accurate camera pose estimation than previous approaches, with geometrically more consistent surface reconstruction results, especially given sparse-view inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, SAM incurs twice the computational cost compared to base optimizer (e.g., SGD). We propose Asymptotic Unbiased Sampling with respect to iterations to accelerate SAM (AUSAM), which maintains the model's generalization capacity while significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Concretely, we probabilistically sample a subset of data points beneficial for SAM optimization based on a theoretically guaranteed criterion, i.e., the Gradient Norm of each Sample (GNS). We further approximate the GNS by the difference in loss values before and after perturbation in SAM. As a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic method, our approach consistently accelerates SAM across a range of tasks and networks, i.e., classification, human pose estimation and network quantization. On CIFAR10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet, AUSAM achieves results comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of over 70%.

| **[NeRF-based Point Cloud Reconstruction using a Stationary Camera for Agricultural Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21958v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a NeRF-based framework for point cloud (PCD) reconstruction, specifically designed for indoor high-throughput plant phenotyping facilities. Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require cameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for high-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on conveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a variant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera to capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises COLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate camera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of Interest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of high-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate excellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an F-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose estimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup, overall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the method's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping applications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D reconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need for complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is especially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such as hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on optimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology to facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D phenotyping pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Uni4D: Unifying Visual Foundation Models for 4D Modeling from a Single Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21761v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a unified approach to understanding dynamic scenes from casual videos. Large pretrained vision foundation models, such as vision-language, video depth prediction, motion tracking, and segmentation models, offer promising capabilities. However, training a single model for comprehensive 4D understanding remains challenging. We introduce Uni4D, a multi-stage optimization framework that harnesses multiple pretrained models to advance dynamic 3D modeling, including static/dynamic reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and dense 3D motion tracking. Our results show state-of-the-art performance in dynamic 4D modeling with superior visual quality. Notably, Uni4D requires no retraining or fine-tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of repurposing visual foundation models for 4D understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Reconstructing Humans with a Biomechanically Accurate Skeleton](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21751v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a method for reconstructing 3D humans from a single image using a biomechanically accurate skeleton model. To achieve this, we train a transformer that takes an image as input and estimates the parameters of the model. Due to the lack of training data for this task, we build a pipeline to produce pseudo ground truth model parameters for single images and implement a training procedure that iteratively refines these pseudo labels. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for 3D human mesh recovery, our model achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, while it significantly outperforms them in settings with extreme 3D poses and viewpoints. Additionally, we show that previous reconstruction methods frequently violate joint angle limits, leading to unnatural rotations. In contrast, our approach leverages the biomechanically plausible degrees of freedom making more realistic joint rotation estimates. We validate our approach across multiple human pose estimation benchmarks.
