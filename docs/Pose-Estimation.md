| **[Scriboora: Rethinking Human Pose Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15565v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose forecasting predicts future poses based on past observations, and has many significant applications in areas such as action recognition, autonomous driving or human-robot interaction. This paper evaluates a wide range of pose forecasting algorithms in the task of absolute pose forecasting, revealing many reproducibility issues, and provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline. After drawing a high-level analogy to the task of speech understanding, it is shown that recent speech models can be efficiently adapted to the task of pose forecasting, and improve current state-of-the-art performance. At last the robustness of the models is evaluated, using noisy joint coordinates obtained from a pose estimator model, to reflect a realistic type of noise, which is more close to real-world applications. For this a new dataset variation is introduced, and it is shown that estimated poses result in a substantial performance degradation, and how much of it can be recovered again by unsupervised finetuning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Learning for Accurate Vision-based Catch Composition in Tropical Tuna Purse Seiners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15468v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purse seiners play a crucial role in tuna fishing, as approximately 69% of the world's tropical tuna is caught using this gear. All tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have established minimum standards to use electronic monitoring (EM) in fisheries in addition to traditional observers. The EM systems produce a massive amount of video data that human analysts must process. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflow can decrease that workload and improve the accuracy of the reports. However, species identification still poses significant challenges for AI, as achieving balanced performance across all species requires appropriate training data. Here, we quantify the difficulty experts face to distinguish bigeye tuna (BET, Thunnus Obesus) from yellowfin tuna (YFT, Thunnus Albacares) using images captured by EM systems. We found inter-expert agreements of 42.9% $\pm$ 35.6% for BET and 57.1% $\pm$ 35.6% for YFT. We then present a multi-stage pipeline to estimate the species composition of the catches using a reliable ground-truth dataset based on identifications made by observers on board. Three segmentation approaches are compared: Mask R-CNN, a combination of DINOv2 with SAM2, and a integration of YOLOv9 with SAM2. We found that the latest performs the best, with a validation mean average precision of 0.66 $\pm$ 0.03 and a recall of 0.88 $\pm$ 0.03. Segmented individuals are tracked using ByteTrack. For classification, we evaluate a standard multiclass classification model and a hierarchical approach, finding a superior generalization by the hierarchical. All our models were cross-validated during training and tested on fishing operations with fully known catch composition. Combining YOLOv9-SAM2 with the hierarchical classification produced the best estimations, with 84.8% of the individuals being segmented and classified with a mean average error of 4.5%.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[ViewBridge:Revisiting Cross-View Localization from Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10716v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3-DoF pose of a ground-view image by aligning it with aerial or satellite imagery. Existing methods typically address this task through direct regression or feature alignment in a shared bird's-eye view (BEV) space. Although effective for coarse alignment, these methods fail to establish fine-grained and geometrically reliable correspondences under large viewpoint variations, thereby limiting both the accuracy and interpretability of localization results. Consequently, we revisit cross-view localization from the perspective of image matching and propose a unified framework that enhances both matching and localization. Specifically, we introduce a Surface Model that constrains BEV feature projection to physically valid regions for geometric consistency, and a SimRefiner that adaptively refines similarity distributions to enhance match reliability. To further support research in this area, we present CVFM, the first benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves geometry-consistent and fine-grained correspondences across extreme viewpoints and further improves the accuracy and stability of cross-view localization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ReassembleNet: Learnable Keypoints and Diffusion for 2D Fresco Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21117v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of reassembly is a significant challenge across multiple domains, including archaeology, genomics, and molecular docking, requiring the precise placement and orientation of elements to reconstruct an original structure. In this work, we address key limitations in state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods for reassembly, namely i) scalability; ii) multimodality; and iii) real-world applicability: beyond square or simple geometric shapes, realistic and complex erosion, or other real-world problems. We propose ReassembleNet, a method that reduces complexity by representing each input piece as a set of contour keypoints and learning to select the most informative ones by Graph Neural Networks pooling inspired techniques. ReassembleNet effectively lowers computational complexity while enabling the integration of features from multiple modalities, including both geometric and texture data. Further enhanced through pretraining on a semi-synthetic dataset. We then apply diffusion-based pose estimation to recover the original structure. We improve on prior methods by 57% and 87% for RMSE Rotation and Translation, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Underage Detection through a Multi-Task and MultiAge Approach for Screening Minors in Unconstrained Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10689v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images requires models robust to distribution shift and resilient to the under-representation of children in public datasets. To address these issues, we propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four binary underage heads (12, 15, 18, and 21 years). This design focuses on the legally critical age range while keeping the backbone frozen. Class imbalance is mitigated through an $α$-reweighted focal loss and age-balanced mini-batch sampling, while an age gap removes ambiguous samples near thresholds. Evaluation is conducted on our new Overall Underage Benchmark (303k cleaned training images, 110k test images), defining both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest domains, and the age estimation wild-shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images, stressing extreme poses ($>$45°), expressions, and low image quality to emulate real-world shifts. Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage model "F" reduces the mean absolute error on ASORES-39k from 4.175 y (age-only baseline) to 4.068 y and improves under-18 detection from F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall while F2 rises from 0.742 to 0.833, demonstrating robustness to domain shift.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RocSync: Millisecond-Accurate Temporal Synchronization for Heterogeneous Camera Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14948v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatiotemporal alignment of multi-view video streams is essential for a wide range of dynamic-scene applications such as multi-view 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, and scene understanding. However, synchronizing multiple cameras remains a significant challenge, especially in heterogeneous setups combining professional and consumer-grade devices, visible and infrared sensors, or systems with and without audio, where common hardware synchronization capabilities are often unavailable. This limitation is particularly evident in real-world environments, where controlled capture conditions are not feasible. In this work, we present a low-cost, general-purpose synchronization method that achieves millisecond-level temporal alignment across diverse camera systems while supporting both visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities. The proposed solution employs a custom-built \textit{LED Clock} that encodes time through red and infrared LEDs, allowing visual decoding of the exposure window (start and end times) from recorded frames for millisecond-level synchronization. We benchmark our method against hardware synchronization and achieve a residual error of 1.34~ms RMSE across multiple recordings. In further experiments, our method outperforms light-, audio-, and timecode-based synchronization approaches and directly improves downstream computer vision tasks, including multi-view pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Finally, we validate the system in large-scale surgical recordings involving over 25 heterogeneous cameras spanning both IR and RGB modalities. This solution simplifies and streamlines the synchronization pipeline and expands access to advanced vision-based sensing in unconstrained environments, including industrial and clinical applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[A visual study of ICP variants for Lidar Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14919v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Odometry with lidar sensors is a state-of-the-art method to estimate the ego pose of a moving vehicle. Many implementations of lidar odometry use variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Real-world effects such as dynamic objects, non-overlapping areas, and sensor noise diminish the accuracy of ICP. We build on a recently proposed method that makes these effects visible by visualizing the multidimensional objective function of ICP in two dimensions. We use this method to study different ICP variants in the context of lidar odometry. In addition, we propose a novel method to filter out dynamic objects and to address the ego blind spot problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Itera...</summary><p>Iterative closest point; Registration; Odometry; Mapping</p></details> | None |
| **[Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11853v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse-view synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of recovering accurate geometry and appearance from limited observations. While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time rendering with competitive quality, existing pipelines often rely on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation, an approach that struggles in genuinely sparse-view settings. Moreover, several SfM-free methods replace SfM with multi-view stereo (MVS) models, but generate massive numbers of 3D Gaussians by back-projecting every pixel into 3D space, leading to high memory costs. We propose Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Gaussian Splatting (SDI-GS), a method that mitigates inefficiency by leveraging region-based segmentation to identify and retain only structurally significant regions. This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud, preserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count. Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count by up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and SSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster training and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for constrained-view scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BEDLAM2.0: Synthetic Humans and Cameras in Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14394v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Datasets and Benchmarks track, oral).

| **[A Quantitative Method for Shoulder Presentation Evaluation in Biometric Identity Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14376v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, conference or journal submission.

| **[Simultaneous Localization and 3D-Semi Dense Mapping for Micro Drones Using Monocular Camera and Inertial Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14335v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms estimate drone poses and build a 3D map using a single camera. Current algorithms include sparse methods that lack detailed geometry, while learning-driven approaches produce dense maps but are computationally intensive. Monocular SLAM also faces scale ambiguities, which affect its accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware lightweight monocular SLAM system combining sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction. Our method employs deep learning-based depth prediction and edge detection, followed by optimization to refine keypoints and edges for geometric consistency, without relying on global loop closure or heavy neural computations. We fuse inertial data with vision by using an extended Kalman filter to resolve scale ambiguity and improve accuracy. The system operates in real time on low-power platforms, as demonstrated on a DJI Tello drone with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. In addition, we demonstrate robust autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor corridors and on the TUM RGBD dataset. Our approach offers an effective, practical solution to real-time mapping and navigation in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LSP-YOLO: A Lightweight Single-Stage Network for Sitting Posture Recognition on Embedded Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14322v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI)</p></details> | None |
| **[Dental3R: Geometry-Aware Pairing for Intraoral 3D Reconstruction from Sparse-View Photographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14315v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[V2VLoc: Robust GNSS-Free Collaborative Perception via LiDAR Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14247v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.</p></details> | AAAI2026 | None |
| **[ArbESC+: Arabic Enhanced Edit Selection System Combination for Grammatical Error Correction Resolving conflict and improving system combination in Arabic GEC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14230v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.</p></details> | 26 pages | None |
| **[iGaussian: Real-Time Camera Pose Estimation via Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14149v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

| **[Transfer learning for high-dimensional Factor-augmented sparse linear model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12435v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study transfer learning for high-dimensional factor-augmented sparse linear models, motivated by applications in economics and finance where strongly correlated predictors and latent factor structures pose major challenges for reliable estimation. Our framework simultaneously mitigates the impact of high correlation and removes the additional contributions of latent factors, thereby reducing potential model misspecification in conventional linear modeling. In such settings, the target dataset is often limited, but multiple heterogeneous auxiliary sources may provide additional information. We develop transfer learning procedures that effectively leverage these auxiliary datasets to improve estimation accuracy, and establish non-asymptotic $\ell_1$- and $\ell_2$-error bounds for the proposed estimators. To prevent negative transfer, we introduce a data-driven source detection algorithm capable of identifying informative auxiliary datasets and prove its consistency. In addition, we provide a hypothesis testing framework for assessing the adequacy of the factor model, together with a procedure for constructing simultaneous confidence intervals for the regression coefficients of interest. Numerical studies demonstrate that our methods achieve substantial gains in estimation accuracy and remain robust under heterogeneity across datasets. Overall, our framework offers a theoretical foundation and a practically scalable solution for incorporating heterogeneous auxiliary information in settings with highly correlated features and latent factor structures.</p></details> | 52 pages, 2 figures | None |
| **[High Dimensional Distributed Gradient Descent with Arbitrary Number of Byzantine Attackers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13352v3)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks pose a major challenge to distributed learning systems, prompting the development of numerous robust learning methods. However, most existing approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. the error increases with the number of model parameters. In this paper, we make a progress towards high dimensional problems, under arbitrary number of Byzantine attackers. The cornerstone of our design is a direct high dimensional semi-verified mean estimation method. The idea is to identify a subspace with large variance. The components of the mean value perpendicular to this subspace are estimated using corrupted gradient vectors uploaded from worker machines, while the components within this subspace are estimated using auxiliary dataset. As a result, a combination of large corrupted dataset and small clean dataset yields significantly better performance than using them separately. We then apply this method as the aggregator for distributed learning problems. The theoretical analysis shows that compared with existing solutions, our method gets rid of $\sqrt{d}$ dependence on the dimensionality, and achieves minimax optimal statistical rates. Numerical results validate our theory as well as the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[SF-Loc: A Visual Mapping and Geo-Localization System based on Sparse Visual Structure Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01500v3)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For high-level geo-spatial applications and intelligent robotics, accurate global pose information is of crucial importance. Map-aided localization is a universal approach to overcome the limitations of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) in challenging environments. However, current solutions face challenges in terms of mapping flexibility, storage burden and re-localization performance. In this work, we present SF-Loc, a lightweight visual mapping and map-aided localization system, whose core idea is the map representation based on sparse frames with dense but compact depth, termed as visual structure frames. In the mapping phase, multi-sensor dense bundle adjustment (MS-DBA) is applied to construct geo-referenced visual structure frames. The local co-visbility is checked to keep the map sparsity and achieve incremental mapping. In the localization phase, coarse-to-fine vision-based localization is performed, in which multi-frame information and the map distribution are fully integrated. To be specific, the concept of spatially smoothed similarity (SSS) is proposed to overcome the place ambiguity, and pairwise frame matching is applied for efficient and robust pose estimation. Experimental results on the cross-season dataset verify the effectiveness of the system. In complex urban road scenarios, the map size is down to 3 MB per kilometer and stable decimeter-level re-localization can be achieved. The code will be made open-source soon (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/SF-Loc).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/SF-Loc) |
| **[Synthetic Geology: Structural Geology Meets Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11164v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the structural geology and mineral composition of the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface from sparse or indirect surface observations remains a long-standing challenge with critical applications in mineral exploration, geohazard assessment, and geotechnical engineering. This inherently ill-posed problem is often addressed by classical geophysical inversion methods, which typically yield a single maximum-likelihood model that fails to capture the full range of plausible geology. The adoption of modern deep learning methods has been limited by the lack of large 3D training datasets. We address this gap with \textit{StructuralGeo}, a geological simulation engine that mimics eons of tectonic, magmatic, and sedimentary processes to generate a virtually limitless supply of realistic synthetic 3D lithological models. Using this dataset, we train both unconditional and conditional generative flow-matching models with a 3D attention U-net architecture. The resulting foundation model can reconstruct multiple plausible 3D scenarios from surface topography and sparse borehole data, depicting structures such as layers, faults, folds, and dikes. By sampling many reconstructions from the same observations, we introduce a probabilistic framework for estimating the size and extent of subsurface features. While the realism of the output is bounded by the fidelity of the training data to true geology, this combination of simulation and generative AI functions offers a flexible prior for probabilistic modeling, regional fine-tuning, and use as an AI-based regularizer in traditional geophysical inversion workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, geological simulation code at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15244035, generative AI code at https://github.com/chipnbits/flowtrain_stochastic_interpolation/releases/tag/v1.0.2</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/chipnbits/flowtrain_stochastic_interpolation) |

We propose an intelligent anti-jamming framework that integrates Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) for high-resolution Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming for adaptive interference suppression, and machine learning (ML) to enhance DoA prediction for mobile jammers. Extensive simulations in a realistic highway scenario demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves an average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of 9.58 dB (maximum 11.08 dB) and up to 99.8% DoA estimation accuracy. The framework's computational efficiency and adaptability to dynamic jammer mobility patterns outperform conventional anti-jamming techniques, making it a robust solution for securing 5G communications in contested environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GRLoc: Geometric Representation Regression for Visual Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13864v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions. We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues. Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose. We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation. RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation. We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, conformal prediction has been used to quantify the uncertainty that the inverse problem contributes to downstream tasks like image classification, image quality assessment, fat mass quantification, etc. While existing works handle only a scalar estimation target, practical applications often involve multiple targets. In response, we propose an asymptotically minimax approach to multi-target conformal prediction that provides tight prediction intervals while ensuring joint marginal coverage. We then outline how our minimax approach can be applied to multi-metric blind image quality assessment, multi-task uncertainty quantification, and multi-round measurement acquisition. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the benefits of our minimax method, relative to existing multi-target conformal prediction methods, using both synthetic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the KV cache memory usage grows substantially with longer text sequences, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Existing KV cache eviction methods prune tokens using prefilling-stage attention scores, causing inconsistency with actual inference queries, especially under tight memory budgets. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Q-Cache (LAQ), a novel eviction framework that generates low-cost pseudo lookahead queries to better approximate the true decoding-stage queries. By using these lookahead queries as the observation window for importance estimation, LAQ achieves more consistent and accurate KV cache eviction aligned with real inference scenarios. Experimental results on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks show that LAQ outperforms existing methods across various budget levels, achieving a 1 $\sim$ 4 point improvement on LongBench under limited cache budget. Moreover, LAQ is complementary to existing approaches and can be flexibly combined to yield further improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> | None |

To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{GeoX-Bench}, a comprehensive \underline{Bench}mark designed to explore and evaluate the capabilities of LMMs in \underline{cross}-view \underline{Geo}-localization and pose estimation. Specifically, GeoX-Bench contains 10,859 panoramic-satellite image pairs spanning 128 cities in 49 countries, along with corresponding 755,976 question-answering (QA) pairs. Among these, 42,900 QA pairs are designated for benchmarking, while the remaining are intended to enhance the capabilities of LMMs. Based on GeoX-Bench, we evaluate the capabilities of 25 state-of-the-art LMMs on cross-view geo-localization and pose estimation tasks, and further explore the empowered capabilities of instruction-tuning. Our benchmark demonstrate that while current LMMs achieve impressive performance in geo-localization tasks, their effectiveness declines significantly on the more complex pose estimation tasks, highlighting a critical area for future improvement, and instruction-tuning LMMs on the training data of GeoX-Bench can significantly improve the cross-view geo-sense abilities.

However, most methods suffer significant performance degradation in cross-domain evaluation due to interference from gaze-irrelevant factors, such as expressions, wearables, and image quality. To alleviate this problem, we present a novel Hybrid-domain Adaptative Representation Learning (shorted by HARL) framework that exploits multi-source hybrid datasets to learn robust gaze representation. More specifically, we propose to disentangle gaze-relevant representation from low-quality facial images by aligning features extracted from high-quality near-eye images in an unsupervised domain-adaptation manner, which hardly requires any computational or inference costs. Additionally, we analyze the effect of head-pose and design a simple yet efficient sparse graph fusion module to explore the geometric constraint between gaze direction and head-pose, leading to a dense and robust gaze representation. Extensive experiments on EyeDiap, MPIIFaceGaze, and Gaze360 datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of $\textbf{5.02}^{\circ}$ and $\textbf{3.36}^{\circ}$, and $\textbf{9.26}^{\circ}$ respectively, and present competitive performances through cross-dataset evaluation.

In such scenarios, accurate odometry estimation is a preliminary requirement for stable locomotion, localization, and mapping. Traditional proprioceptive approaches, which rely on leg kinematics sensor modalities and inertial sensing, suffer from irrepressible vertical drift caused by frequent contact impacts, foot slippage, and vibrations, particularly affected by inaccurate roll and pitch estimation. Existing methods incorporate exteroceptive sensors such as LiDAR or cameras. Further enhancement has been introduced by leveraging gravity vector estimation to add additional observations on roll and pitch, thereby increasing the accuracy of vertical pose estimation. However, these approaches tend to degrade in feature-sparse or repetitive scenes and are prone to errors from double-integrated IMU acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose GaRLILEO, a novel gravity-aligned continuous-time radar-leg-inertial odometry framework. GaRLILEO decouples velocity from the IMU by building a continuous-time ego-velocity spline from SoC radar Doppler and leg kinematics information, enabling seamless sensor fusion which mitigates odometry distortion. In addition, GaRLILEO can reliably capture accurate gravity vectors leveraging a novel soft S2-constrained gravity factor, improving vertical pose accuracy without relying on LiDAR or cameras. Evaluated on a self-collected real-world dataset with diverse indoor-outdoor trajectories, GaRLILEO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly in vertical odometry estimation on stairs and slopes. We open-source both our dataset and algorithm to foster further research in legged robot odometry and SLAM. https://garlileo.github.io/GaRLILEO</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://garlileo.github.io/GaRLILEO) |

This design relies on heuristic operations such as detection, RoI cropping, and non-maximum suppression (NMS), limiting both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present a fully end-to-end framework for multi-person 2D pose estimation in videos, effectively eliminating heuristic operations. A key challenge is to associate individuals across frames under complex and overlapping temporal trajectories. To address this, we introduce a novel Pose-Aware Video transformEr Network (PAVE-Net), which features a spatial encoder to model intra-frame relations and a spatiotemporal pose decoder to capture global dependencies across frames. To achieve accurate temporal association, we propose a pose-aware attention mechanism that enables each pose query to selectively aggregate features corresponding to the same individual across consecutive frames.Additionally, we explicitly model spatiotemporal dependencies among pose keypoints to improve accuracy. Notably, our approach is the first end-to-end method for multi-frame 2D human pose estimation.Extensive experiments show that PAVE-Net substantially outperforms prior image-based end-to-end methods, achieving a \textbf{6.0} mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017, and delivers accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art two-stage video-based approaches, while offering significant gains in efficiency.Project page: https://github.com/zgspose/PAVENet</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/zgspose/PAVENet) |

Recent DETR-based methods attempt to mitigate this through global attention and auxiliary depth prediction, yet they still struggle with inaccurate depth estimates. Moreover, these methods often overlook instance-level detection difficulty, such as occlusion, distance, and truncation, leading to suboptimal detection performance. We propose MonoDLGD, a novel Difficulty-Aware Label-Guided Denoising framework that adaptively perturbs and reconstructs ground-truth labels based on detection uncertainty. Specifically, MonoDLGD applies stronger perturbations to easier instances and weaker ones into harder cases, and then reconstructs them to effectively provide explicit geometric supervision. By jointly optimizing label reconstruction and 3D object detection, MonoDLGD encourages geometry-aware representation learning and improves robustness to varying levels of object complexity. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that MonoDLGD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all difficulty levels.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 accepted | None |

While this paradigm enhances robustness and flexibility by disentangling the dependency of support images, our critical analysis reveals two inherent limitations of static joint embedding: (1) polysemy-induced cross-category ambiguity during the matching process(e.g., the concept "leg" exhibiting divergent visual manifestations across humans and furniture), and (2) insufficient discriminability for fine-grained intra-category variations (e.g., posture and fur discrepancies between a sleeping white cat and a standing black cat). To overcome these challenges, we propose a new framework that innovatively integrates hierarchical cross-modal interaction with dual-stream feature refinement, enhancing the joint embedding with both class-level and instance-specific cues from textual description and specific images. Experiments on the MP-100 dataset demonstrate that, regardless of the network backbone, CapeNext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CAPE methods by a large margin.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18320v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures | None |

Many learning-based and model-based methods exist that estimate event-based optical flow, however the temporally dense yet spatially sparse nature of events poses significant challenges. To address these issues, contrast maximization (CM) is a prominent model-based optimization methodology that estimates the motion trajectories of events within an event volume by optimally warping them. Since its introduction, the CM framework has undergone a series of refinements by the computer vision community. Nonetheless, it remains a highly non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel biologically-inspired hybrid CM method for event-based optical flow estimation that couples visual and inertial motion cues. Concretely, we propose the use of orientation maps, derived from camera 3D velocities, as priors to guide the CM process. The orientation maps provide directional guidance and constrain the space of estimated motion trajectories. We show that this orientation-guided formulation leads to improved robustness and convergence in event-based optical flow estimation. The evaluation of our approach on the MVSEC, DSEC, and ECD datasets yields superior accuracy scores over the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> | None |

This approach proves to be effective also in challenging cases under more extreme pose variation. Experimental validation demonstrates that our method consistently achieves robust and accurate registration, enhancing the reliability of 2D/3D registration for clinical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method consists of two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pose-aware diffusion model from few-shot OOTD examples and (2) distilling a 3D avatar represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). In the first stage, unlike previous methods that segment images into assets (e.g., garments, accessories) for 3D assembly, which is prone to inconsistency, we avoid decomposition and directly model the full-body appearance. By integrating a pre-trained ControlNet for pose estimation and a novel Condition Prior Preservation Loss (CPPL), our method enables end-to-end learning of fine details while mitigating language drift in few-shot training. Our method completes personalization in just 5 minutes, achieving a 48$\times$ speed-up compared to previous approaches. In the second stage, we introduce a NeRF-based avatar representation optimized by canonical SMPL-X space sampling and Multi-Resolution 3D-SDS. Compared to mesh-based representations that suffer from resolution-dependent discretization and erroneous occluded geometry, our continuous radiance field can preserve high-frequency textures (e.g., hair) and handle occlusions correctly through transmittance. Experiments demonstrate that PFAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, detail preservation, and robustness to occlusions/truncations, advancing practical 3D avatar generation from real-world OOTD albums. In addition, the reconstructed 3D avatar supports downstream applications such as virtual try-on, animation, and human video reenactment, further demonstrating the versatility and practical value of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

To reduce dependency on 3D models, recent studies have explored one-reference-based pose estimation, which requires only a single reference view instead of a complete 3D model. However, existing methods that rely on real-valued coordinate regression suffer from limited global consistency due to the local nature of convolutional architectures and face challenges in symmetric or occluded scenarios owing to a lack of uncertainty modeling. We present CoordAR, a novel autoregressive framework for one-reference 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. CoordAR formulates 3D-3D correspondences between the reference and query views as a map of discrete tokens, which is obtained in an autoregressive and probabilistic manner. To enable accurate correspondence regression, CoordAR introduces 1) a novel coordinate map tokenization that enables probabilistic prediction over discretized 3D space; 2) a modality-decoupled encoding strategy that separately encodes RGB appearance and coordinate cues; and 3) an autoregressive transformer decoder conditioned on both position-aligned query features and the partially generated token sequence. With these novel mechanisms, CoordAR significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks and demonstrates strong robustness to symmetry, occlusion, and other challenges in real-world tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted by AAAI 2026 (oral)</p></details> | None |

Previous methods tried to solve this problem by actively gathering multiple views before grasp pose generation. However, they either overlooked the importance of the grasp distribution for information gain estimation or relied on the projection of the grasp distribution, which ignores the structure of grasp poses on the SE(3) manifold. To tackle these challenges, we propose a calibrated energy-based model for grasp pose generation and an active view selection method that estimates information gain from grasp distribution. Our energy-based model captures the multi-modality nature of grasp distribution on the SE(3) manifold. The energy level is calibrated to the success rate of grasps so that the predicted distribution aligns with the real distribution. The next best view is selected by estimating the information gain for grasp from the calibrated distribution conditioned on the reconstructed environment, which could efficiently drive the robot to explore affordable parts of the target object. Experiments on simulated environments and real robot setups demonstrate that our model could successfully grasp objects in a cluttered environment with limited view budgets compared to previous state-of-the-art models. Our simulated environment can serve as a reproducible platform for future research on active grasping. The source code of our paper will be made public when the paper is released to the public.</p></details> | under review | None |

Classical models such as Croston, SBA, and the Teunter-Syntetos-Babai (TSB) method provide simple heuristics but lack a principled generative foundation. Deep learning models address these limitations but often require large datasets and sacrifice interpretability. We introduce TSB-HB, a hierarchical Bayesian extension of TSB. Demand occurrence is modeled with a Beta-Binomial distribution, while nonzero demand sizes follow a Log-Normal distribution. Crucially, hierarchical priors enable partial pooling across items, stabilizing estimates for sparse or cold-start series while preserving heterogeneity. This framework yields a fully generative and interpretable model that generalizes classical exponential smoothing. On the UCI Online Retail dataset, TSB-HB achieves lower RMSE and RMSSE than Croston, SBA, TSB, ADIDA, IMAPA, ARIMA and Theta, and on a subset of the M5 dataset it outperforms all classical baselines we evaluate. The model provides calibrated probabilistic forecasts and improved accuracy on intermittent and lumpy items by combining a generative formulation with hierarchical shrinkage, while remaining interpretable and scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 11 pages, 1 figure, Equal contribution by the two authors</p></details> | None |

Our pipeline begins with an onboarding stage that generates object representations from either traditional 3D CAD models or, in their absence, by rapidly reconstructing a high-fidelity neural representation (NeRF) from multi-view images. Given a test image, our system first employs the CNOS detector to localize target objects. For each detection, our novel pose estimation module, OPFormer, infers the precise 6D pose. The core of OPFormer is a transformer-based architecture that leverages a foundation model for robust feature extraction. It uniquely learns a comprehensive object representation by jointly encoding multiple template views and enriches these features with explicit 3D geometric priors using Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS). A decoder then establishes robust 2D-3D correspondences to determine the final pose. Evaluated on the challenging BOP benchmarks, our integrated system demonstrates a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency, showcasing its practical applicability in both model-based and model-free scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In order to make this correspondence search tractable in large scenes, existing pipelines either rely on search heuristics, or perform image retrieval to reduce the search space by comparing the current image to a database of past observations. However, these approaches result in elaborate pipelines or storage requirements that grow with the number of past observations. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for making structure-based relocalisation tractable. Instead of relying on image retrieval or search heuristics, we learn a direct mapping from image observations to the visible scene structure in a compact neural network. Given a query image, a forward pass through our novel visible structure retrieval network allows obtaining the subset of 3D structure points in the map that the image views, thus reducing the search space of 2D-3D correspondences. We show that our proposed method enables performing localisation with an accuracy comparable to the state of the art, while requiring lower computational and storage footprint.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2025</p></details> | None |

Our framework simultaneously mitigates the impact of high correlation and removes the additional contributions of latent factors, thereby reducing potential model misspecification in conventional linear modeling. In such settings, the target dataset is often limited, but multiple heterogeneous auxiliary sources may provide additional information. We develop transfer learning procedures that effectively leverage these auxiliary datasets to improve estimation accuracy, and establish non-asymptotic $\ell_1$- and $\ell_2$-error bounds for the proposed estimators. To prevent negative transfer, we introduce a data-driven source detection algorithm capable of identifying informative auxiliary datasets and prove its consistency. In addition, we provide a hypothesis testing framework for assessing the adequacy of the factor model, together with a procedure for constructing simultaneous confidence intervals for the regression coefficients of interest. Numerical studies demonstrate that our methods achieve substantial gains in estimation accuracy and remain robust under heterogeneity across datasets. Overall, our framework offers a theoretical foundation and a practically scalable solution for incorporating heterogeneous auxiliary information in settings with highly correlated features and latent factor structures.</p></details> | 52 pages, 2 figures | None |

However, scaling deeper GNNs poses challenges due to the neighbor explosion problem when training on large-scale graphs. To mitigate this, a promising class of GNN training algorithms utilizes historical embeddings to reduce computation and memory costs while preserving the expressiveness of the model. These methods leverage historical embeddings for out-of-batch nodes, effectively approximating full-batch training without losing any neighbor information-a limitation found in traditional sampling methods. However, the staleness of these historical embeddings often introduces significant bias, acting as a bottleneck that can adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel VersatIle Staleness-Aware GNN, named VISAGNN, which dynamically and adaptively incorporates staleness criteria into the large-scale GNN training process. By embedding staleness into the message passing mechanism, loss function, and historical embeddings during training, our approach enables the model to adaptively mitigate the negative effects of stale embeddings, thereby reducing estimation errors and enhancing downstream accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in overcoming the staleness issue of existing historical embedding techniques, showcasing its superior performance and efficiency on large-scale benchmarks, along with significantly faster convergence.</p></details> |  | None |

The recent pose-only imaging geometry decouples 3D coordinates from camera poses and demonstrates significantly better SfM performance through pose adjustment. Continuing the pose-only perspective, this paper explores the critical relationship between the scene structures, rotation and translation. Notably, the translation can be expressed in terms of rotation, allowing us to condense the imaging geometry representation onto the rotation manifold. A rotation-only optimization framework based on reprojection error is proposed for both two-view and multi-view scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness performance over the current state-of-the-art rotation estimation methods, even comparable to multiple bundle adjustment iteration results. Hopefully, this work contributes to even more accurate, efficient and reliable 3D visual computing.</p></details> |  | None |

State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large, non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of non-hierarchical counterparts.

Existing online SCD methods are significantly less accurate than offline approaches. We present the first online SCD approach that is pose-agnostic, label-free, and ensures multi-view consistency, while operating at over 10 FPS and achieving new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even the best offline approaches. Our method introduces a new self-supervised fusion loss to infer scene changes from multiple cues and observations, PnP-based fast pose estimation against the reference scene, and a fast change-guided update strategy for the 3D Gaussian Splatting scene representation. Extensive experiments on complex real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms both online and offline baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Core of our approach is a novel 3D calibration target, specifically designed and constructed to be concurrently perceived by all three sensing modalities. The target encodes features in planes, ChArUco, and active LED patterns, each tailored to the unique characteristics of LiDARs, RGB cameras, and event cameras respectively. This unique design enables a one-shot, joint extrinsic calibration process, in contrast to existing approaches that typically rely on separate, pairwise calibrations. Our calibration pipeline is designed to accurately calibrate complex vision systems in the context of autonomous driving, where precise multi-sensor alignment is critical. We validate our approach through an extensive experimental evaluation on a custom built dataset, recorded with an advanced autonomous driving sensor setup, confirming the accuracy and robustness of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

Real-time UE detection has been limited, largely due to the ethical and privacy challenges of obtaining annotated ICU video data. We propose Augmented Unplanned Removal Alert (AURA), a vision-based risk detection system developed and validated entirely on a fully synthetic video dataset. By leveraging text-to-video diffusion, we generated diverse and clinically realistic ICU scenarios capturing a range of patient behaviors and care contexts. The system applies pose estimation to identify two high-risk movement patterns: collision, defined as hand entry into spatial zones near airway tubes, and agitation, quantified by the velocity of tracked anatomical keypoints. Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition. This work demonstrates a novel pathway for developing privacy-preserving, reproducible patient safety monitoring systems with potential for deployment in intensive care settings.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |

We first quantify this assumption and show that, on AffectNet, training from random initialization with sufficiently strong augmentation consistently matches or surpasses fine-tuning from ImageNet. Motivated by this result, we propose Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) for FER in the wild. HMTL augments supervised learning (SL) with self-supervised learning (SSL) objectives during training, while keeping the inference-time model unchanged. We instantiate HMTL with two tailored pretext tasks, puzzling and inpainting with a perceptual loss, that encourage part-aware and expression-relevant features. On AffectNet, both HMTL variants achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the eight-emotion setting without any additional pretraining data, and they provide larger gains under low-data regimes. Compared with conventional SSL pretraining, HMTL yields stronger downstream performance. Beyond FER, the same strategy improves fine-grained facial analysis tasks, including head pose estimation and gender recognition. These results suggest that aligned SSL auxiliaries are an effective and simple way to strengthen supervised fine-grained facial representation without adding extra computation cost during inference time.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods largely rely on visual cues alone, often producing results that violate physical constraints such as interpenetration or non-contact. Recent efforts to incorporate physics reasoning typically depend on post-optimization or non-differentiable physics engines, which compromise visual consistency and end-to-end trainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that jointly integrates visual and physical cues for hand-object pose estimation. This integration is achieved through two key ideas: 1) joint visual-physical cue learning: The model is trained to extract 2D visual cues and 3D physical cues, thereby enabling more comprehensive representation learning for hand-object interactions; 2) candidate pose aggregation: A novel refinement process that aggregates multiple diffusion-generated candidate poses by leveraging both visual and physical predictions, yielding a final estimate that is visually consistent and physically plausible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in both pose accuracy and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, extended version of the AAAI 2026 paper "VPHO: Joint Visual-Physical Cue Learning and Aggregation for Hand-Object Pose Estimation"</p></details> | None |

Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer (ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves) and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TPAMI2025</p></details> | None |

To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extended version for Credal Ensemble Distillation for Uncertainty Quantification, which has been accepted for publication at AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[LARM: A Large Articulated-Object Reconstruction Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11563v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling 3D articulated objects with realistic geometry, textures, and kinematics is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site) |

While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity. Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual Riemannian Newton Method on Statistical Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11318v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In probabilistic modeling, parameter estimation is commonly formulated as a minimization problem on a parameter manifold. Optimization in such spaces requires geometry-aware methods that respect the underlying information structure. While the natural gradient leverages the Fisher information metric as a form of Riemannian gradient descent, it remains a first-order method and often exhibits slow convergence near optimal solutions. Existing second-order manifold algorithms typically rely on the Levi-Civita connection, thus overlooking the dual-connection structure that is central to information geometry. We propose the dual Riemannian Newton method, a Newton-type optimization algorithm on manifolds endowed with a metric and a pair of dual affine connections. The dual Riemannian Newton method explicates how duality shapes second-order updates: when the retraction (a local surrogate of the exponential map) is defined by one connection, the associated Newton equation is posed with its dual. We establish local quadratic convergence and validate the theory with experiments on representative statistical models. Thus, the dual Riemannian Newton method thus delivers second-order efficiency while remaining compatible with the dual structures that underlie modern information-geometric learning and inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[6D Strawberry Pose Estimation: Real-time and Edge AI Solutions Using Purely Synthetic Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11307v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a deep learning-enhanced framework for delineating anticoagulant efficacy ex vivo using Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM). We demonstrate a label-free, non-invasive approach for analyzing human blood samples, capable of accurate cell counting and morphological estimation. A DHM with an automated image processing and deep learning pipeline is built for morphological analysis of the blood cells under two different anti-coagulation agents, e.g. conventional EDTA and novel potassium ferric oxalate nanoparticles (KFeOx-NPs). This enables automated high-throughput screening of cells and estimation of blood coagulation rates when samples are treated with different anticoagulants. Results indicated that KFeOx-NPs prevented human blood coagulation without altering the cellular morphology of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas EDTA incubation caused notable changes within 6 hours of incubation. The system allows for quantitative analysis of coagulation dynamics by assessing parameters like cell clustering and morphology over time in these prepared samples, offering insights into the comparative efficacy and effects of anticoagulants outside the body.</p></details> |  | None |

An extensively studied instance is the \emph{covariate shift}, where the marginal distribution of covariates differs across domains, while the conditional distribution of outcome remains the same. The doubly-robust (DR) estimator, recently introduced by \cite{kato2023double}, combines the density ratio estimation with a pilot regression model and demonstrates asymptotic normality and $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, even when the pilot estimates converge slowly. However, the prior arts has focused exclusively on deriving asymptotic results and has left open the question of non-asymptotic guarantees for the DR estimator. This paper establishes the first non-asymptotic learning bounds for the DR covariate shift adaptation. Our main contributions are two-fold: (\romannumeral 1) We establish \emph{structure-agnostic} high-probability upper bounds on the excess target risk of the DR estimator that depend only on the $L^2$-errors of the pilot estimates and the Rademacher complexity of the model class, without assuming specific procedures to obtain the pilot estimate, and (\romannumeral 2) under \emph{well-specified parameterized models}, we analyze the DR covariate shift adaptation based on modern techniques for non-asymptotic analysis of MLE, whose key terms governed by the Fisher information mismatch term between the source and target distributions. Together, these findings bridge asymptotic efficiency properties and a finite-sample out-of-distribution generalization bounds, providing a comprehensive theoretical underpinnings for the DR covariate shift adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, comments are welcome</p></details> | None |

To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://livioni.github.io/OmniVGGT-official/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://livioni.github.io/OmniVGGT-official) |

Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2 $mm$ MPJPE and 112.6 $mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks, stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger model sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.liruilong.cn/prope/</p></details> | None |
| **[Proximal Causal Inference for Conditional Separable Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11020v4)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientists regularly pose questions about treatment effects on outcomes conditional on a post-treatment event. However, causal inference in such settings requires care, even in perfectly executed randomized experiments. Recently, the conditional separable effect (CSE) was proposed as an interventionist estimand that corresponds to scientifically meaningful questions in these settings. However, existing results for the CSE require no unmeasured confounding between the outcome and post-treatment event, an assumption frequently violated in practice. In this work, we address this concern by developing new identification and estimation results for the CSE that allow for unmeasured confounding. We establish nonparametric identification of the CSE in observational and experimental settings with time-varying confounders, provided that certain proxy variables for hidden common causes of the post-treatment event and outcome are available. For inference, we characterize an influence function for the CSE under a semiparametric model where nuisance functions are a priori unrestricted. Using modern machine learning methods, we construct nonparametric nuisance function estimators and establish convergence rates that improve upon existing results. Moreover, we develop a consistent, asymptotically linear, and locally semiparametric efficient estimator of the CSE. We illustrate our framework with simulation studies and a real-world cancer therapy trial.</p></details> |  | None |

We address the unprecedented challenge of simultaneously handling linear constraints, stochastic noise, and finite-time analysis in bilevel optimization, a combination that has remained theoretically intractable until now. While existing approaches either require second-order information, handle only unconstrained stochastic problems, or provide merely asymptotic convergence results, our method achieves finite-time guarantees using gradient-based techniques alone. We develop a novel framework that constructs hypergradient approximations via smoothed penalty functions, using approximate primal and dual solutions to overcome the fundamental challenges posed by the interaction between linear constraints and stochastic noise. Our theoretical analysis provides explicit finite-time bounds on the bias and variance of the hypergradient estimator, demonstrating how approximation errors interact with stochastic perturbations. We prove that our first-order algorithm converges to $(δ, ε)$-Goldstein stationary points using $Θ(δ^{-1}ε^{-5})$ stochastic gradient evaluations, establishing the first finite-time complexity result for this challenging problem class and representing a significant theoretical breakthrough in constrained stochastic bilevel optimization.</p></details> | 40 pages, 2 figures | None |
| **[FASTopoWM: Fast-Slow Lane Segment Topology Reasoning with Latent World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23325v4)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV) road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently, stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5% on OLS).</p></details> |  | None |

Motion capture (MoCap) systems are frequently used to generate ground truth annotations for human poses when training models with data from wearable or ambient sensors, and have been shown to be effective to synthesize data in these modalities. However, the representation of older adults, an increasingly important demographic in healthcare, in existing MoCap locomotion datasets has not been thoroughly examined. This work surveyed 41 publicly available datasets, identifying eight that include older adult motions and four that contain motions performed by younger actors annotated as old style. Older adults represent a small portion of participants overall, and few datasets provide full-body motion data for this group. To assess the fidelity of old-style walking motions, quantitative metrics are introduced, defining high fidelity as the ability to capture age-related differences relative to normative walking. Using gait parameters that are age-sensitive, robust to noise, and resilient to data scarcity, we found that old-style walking motions often exhibit overly controlled patterns and fail to faithfully characterize aging. These findings highlight the need for improved representation of older adults in motion datasets and establish a method to quantitatively evaluate the quality of old-style walking motions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,4 figures, to be published in IEEE AIOT 2025</p></details> | None |

We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we present a novel stochastic observer-based shape estimation framework designed specifically for continuum robots. The shape state space is uniquely represented by the modal coefficients of a polynomial, enabled by leveraging polynomial curvature kinematics (PCK) to describe the curvature distribution along the arclength. Our framework processes noisy measurements from limited discrete position, orientation, or pose sensors to estimate the shape state robustly. We derive a novel noise-weighted observability matrix, providing a detailed assessment of observability variations under diverse sensor configurations. To overcome the limitations of a single model, our observer employs the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) method, coupled with Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs), to mix polynomial curvature models of different orders. The IMM approach, rooted in Markov processes, effectively manages multiple model scenarios by dynamically adapting to different polynomial orders based on real-time model probabilities. This adaptability is key to ensuring robust shape estimation of the robot's behaviors under various conditions. Our comprehensive analysis, supported by both simulation studies and experimental validations, confirms the robustness and accuracy of our methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages.

Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.</p></details> |  | None |

DCM is designed for detecting signal(-s) superimposed on an unknown trend. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational statistical well-posed solution for this problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple time series analysis method computes a massive number of linear least squares fits. Hence, the data spacing, even or uneven, is irrelevant. We use the Fisher-test to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. This best model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of simulated complex data sets expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DFT and DCM are frequency-domain parametric methods. There are many other similar parametric methods. Just like DFT, those other methods suffer from their own particular application limitations. The list of those limitations is long. DCM suffers from none of those limitations. The performance of DCM depends only on the data set size and accuracy. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the data set time span $(ΔT)$ is irrelevant. It does not matter how long $(ΔT)$ and/or complex the data set is because DCM will inevitably detect the signal(-s) and the trend when the data set size $(n)$ and/or accuracy $(σ)$ become adequate.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures | None |

However, its performance degrades in degenerate environments, such as long corridors and high-altitude flights, where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation. In this letter, we present LODESTAR, a novel LIO method that addresses these degeneracies through two key modules: degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF) and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE). DA-ASKF employs a sliding window to utilize past states and measurements as additional constraints. Specifically, it introduces degeneracy-aware sliding modes that adaptively classify states as active or fixed based on their degeneracy level. Using Schmidt-Kalman update, it partially optimizes active states while preserving fixed states. These fixed states influence the update of active states via their covariances, serving as reference anchors--akin to a lodestar. Additionally, DA-DE prunes less-informative measurements from active states and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states, based on their localizability contribution and the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Consequently, DA-ASKF enables degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and mitigates measurement sparsity, while DA-DE addresses measurement imbalance. Experimental results show that LODESTAR outperforms existing LiDAR-based odometry methods and degeneracy-aware modules in terms of accuracy and robustness under various degenerate conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables, accepted for the publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> | None |

This approach is computationally expensive, limiting their real-time performance on resource-constrained devices. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sparse Motion Field Visual Odometry (SMF-VO), a lightweight, 'motion-centric' framework. Our approach directly estimates instantaneous linear and angular velocity from sparse optical flow, bypassing the need for explicit pose estimation or expensive landmark tracking. We also employed a generalized 3D ray-based motion field formulation that works accurately with various camera models, including wide-field-of-view lenses. SMF-VO demonstrates superior efficiency and competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets, achieving over 100 FPS on a Raspberry Pi 5 using only a CPU. Our work establishes a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional methods, making it highly suitable for mobile robotics and wearable devices.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing software is developed based on models or motion-captured data, resulting in limited flexibility. To address this issue, a simulator that directly generates Doppler spectra from recorded video footage (RadHARSimulator V2) is presented in this paper. Both computer vision and radar modules are included in the simulator. In computer vision module, the real-time model for object detection with global nearest neighbor is first used to detect and track human targets in the video. Then, the high-resolution network is used to estimate two-dimensional poses of the detected human targets. Next, the three-dimensional poses of the detected human targets are obtained by nearest matching method. Finally, smooth temporal three-dimensional pose estimation is achieved through Kalman filtering. In radar module, pose interpolation and smoothing are first achieved through the Savitzky-Golay method. Second, the delay model and the mirror method are used to simulate echoes in both free-space and through-the-wall scenarios. Then, range-time map is generated using pulse compression, moving target indication, and DnCNN. Next, Doppler-time map (DTM) is generated using short-time Fourier transform and DnCNN again. Finally, the ridge features on the DTM are extracted using the maximum local energy method. In addition, a hybrid parallel-serial neural network architecture is proposed for radar-based HAR. Numerical experiments are conducted and analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed simulator and the proposed network model.

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods relying on spatial and temporal consistency alone are insufficient to resolve these problems especially in the presence of significant occlusions or high dynamic actions. Semantic information, however, offers a complementary signal that can help disambiguate such cases. To this end, we propose LangPose, a framework that leverages action knowledge by aligning motion embeddings with text embeddings of fine-grained action labels. LangPose operates in two stages: pretraining and fine-tuning. In the pretraining stage, the model simultaneously learns to recognize actions and reconstruct 3D poses from masked and noisy 2D poses. During the fine-tuning stage, the model is further refined using real-world 3D human pose estimation datasets without action labels. Additionally, our framework incorporates masked body parts and masked time windows in motion modeling, encouraging the model to leverage semantic information when spatial and temporal consistency is unreliable. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LangPose, achieving SOTA level performance in 3D pose estimation on public datasets, including Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Specifically, LangPose achieves an MPJPE of 36.7mm on Human3.6M with detected 2D poses as input and 15.5mm on MPI-INF-3DHP with ground-truth 2D poses as input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV2026.

However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The inspection task is represented by a global information-driven cost functional that integrates the sensor model, spacecraft poses, and mission-level information-gain objectives. This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators. An adaptive thresholding mechanism captures the time-varying inspection geometry and dynamic mission conditions. Simulation results for representative multi-spacecraft inspection scenarios demonstrate the reliability of fault localization and classification under uncertainty, providing a unified, information-driven foundation for resilient autonomous inspection architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>AIAA ...</summary><p>AIAA Book Chapter (accepted)</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance.

State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods.

Existing paradigms are mainly confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages: 1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery: restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on large-scale diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable world understanding capabilities that benefit for various vision tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in MDE through fine-tuning these VFMs. Inspired by these developments, we propose WEDepth, a novel approach that adapts VFMs for MDE without modi-fying their structures and pretrained weights, while effec-tively eliciting and leveraging their inherent priors. Our method employs the VFM as a multi-level feature en-hancer, systematically injecting prior knowledge at differ-ent representation levels.

While ALS is widely used for providing personalized recommendations based on user-item interaction data, its high computational cost, stemming from repeated regression operations, poses significant challenges for large-scale datasets. To enhance the efficiency of ALS, we propose a core-elements subsampling method that selects a representative subset of data and leverages sparse matrix operations to approximate ALS estimations efficiently. We establish theoretical guarantees for the approximation and convergence of the proposed approach, showing that it achieves similar accuracy with significantly reduced computational time compared to full-data ALS. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios, emphasizing its potential in large-scale recommendation systems.</p></details> |  | None |

The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory. The initial and desired points are detected automatically using ArUco marker pose estimation and circle detection techniques. After presenting the mathematical model and vision techniques, the developed algorithm is compared with well-known algorithms on different virtual scenes created in the V-REP simulation program and a physical setup created in a laboratory environment. Results are promising and demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods typically build networks on top of 2D visual backbones and depend heavily on labeled data for training, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios, causing a sim-to-real gap. Moreover, these approaches reduce the 3D-based problem to 2D domain, neglecting the 3D priors. To address these, we propose Robot Topological Alignment Graph (RoboTAG), which incorporates a 3D branch to inject 3D priors while enabling co-evolution of the 2D and 3D representations, alleviating the reliance on labels. Specifically, the RoboTAG consists of a 3D branch and a 2D branch, where nodes represent the states of the camera and robot system, and edges capture the dependencies between these variables or denote alignments between them. Closed loops are then defined in the graph, on which a consistency supervision across branches can be applied. This design allows us to utilize in-the-wild images as training data without annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective across robot types, highlighting its potential to alleviate the data bottleneck in robotics.</p></details> |  | None |

We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2) the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first \underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW}, for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting. \texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L Δσ_l^2)/(S K R ε^2)}+(L Δ)/R)$ without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of \texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy.

Among these descriptors, GeDi has demonstrated strong zero-shot 6D pose estimation capabilities but remains computationally impractical for real-world applications due to its expensive inference process. Can we retain GeDi's effectiveness while significantly improving its efficiency? In this paper, we explore this question by introducing a knowledge distillation framework that trains an efficient student model to regress local descriptors from a GeDi teacher. Our key contributions include: an efficient large-scale training procedure that ensures robustness to occlusions and partial observations while operating under compute and storage constraints, and a novel loss formulation that handles weak supervision from non-distinctive teacher descriptors. We validate our approach on five BOP Benchmark datasets and demonstrate a significant reduction in inference time while maintaining competitive performance with existing methods, bringing zero-shot 6D pose estimation closer to real-time feasibility.

Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end, we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can naturally leverage global context information at different stages. Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set, which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the network to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably, this prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby mitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation, homography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks.

Many inference methods struggle to explore the parameter space efficiently under a limited budget of likelihood evaluations. Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC) is a sample-efficient method that addresses this by building a local surrogate model of the log-posterior. However, its conservative exploration strategy, while promoting stability, can cause it to miss important regions of the posterior, such as distinct modes or long tails. In this work, we introduce Stacking Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (S-VBMC), a method that overcomes this limitation by constructing a robust, global posterior approximation from multiple independent VBMC runs. Our approach merges these local approximations through a principled and inexpensive post-processing step that leverages VBMC's mixture posterior representation and per-component evidence estimates. Crucially, S-VBMC requires no additional likelihood evaluations and is naturally parallelisable, fitting seamlessly into existing inference workflows. We demonstrate its effectiveness on two synthetic problems designed to challenge VBMC's exploration and two real-world applications from computational neuroscience, showing substantial improvements in posterior approximation quality across all cases.

One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance.

However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

While sparse training offers efficiency gains, existing methods fail to preserve critical structural relationships between weight matrices that interact multiplicatively in attention and feed-forward layers. This oversight leads to performance degradation at high sparsity levels. We introduce EcoSpa, an efficient structured sparse training method that jointly evaluates and sparsifies coupled weight matrix pairs, preserving their interaction patterns through aligned row/column removal. EcoSpa introduces a new granularity for calibrating structural component importance and performs coupled estimation and sparsification across both pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios. Evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: EcoSpa enables efficient training of LLaMA-1B with 50\% memory reduction and 21\% faster training, achieves $2.2\times$ model compression on GPT-2-Medium with $2.4$ lower perplexity, and delivers $1.6\times$ inference speedup. The approach uses standard PyTorch operations, requiring no custom hardware or kernels, making efficient transformer training accessible on commodity hardware.</p></details> |  | None |

Developing such systems often requires large, well-annotated datasets, but existing resources often address isolated tasks, neglect temporal dependencies, or lack multi-center variability. We present the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) dataset, comprising eight complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos recorded at three medical centers. The dataset provides frame-level annotations for three interconnected tasks: surgical phase recognition (485,875 frames), instrument keypoint estimation (19,435 frames), and instrument instance segmentation (19,435 frames). PhaKIR is, to our knowledge, the first multi-institutional dataset to jointly provide phase labels, instrument pose information, and pixel-accurate instrument segmentations, while also enabling the exploitation of temporal context since full surgical procedure sequences are available. It served as the basis for the PhaKIR Challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) Challenge at MICCAI 2024 to benchmark methods in surgical scene understanding, thereby further validating the dataset's quality and relevance.

While qualitative studies highlight the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with traditional optimization, a formal, quantitative demonstration of this synergy is lacking. This paper introduces a novel stochastic learning-optimization framework that integrates Bayesian inference with inventory optimization for supply chain management (SCM). We model a two-echelon inventory system subject to stochastic demand and supply disruptions, comparing a traditional static optimization policy against an adaptive policy where Bayesian learning continuously updates parameter estimates to inform stochastic optimization. Our simulations over 365 periods across three operational scenarios demonstrate that the integrated approach achieves 7.4\% cost reduction in stable environments and 5.7\% improvement during supply disruptions, while revealing important limitations during sudden demand shocks due to the inherent conservatism of Bayesian updating. This work provides mathematical validation for practitioner observations and establishes a formal framework for understanding AI-driven supply chain resilience, while identifying critical boundary conditions for successful implementation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures | None |

Recovering similar room impulse response (RIR) directly from reverberant speech offers more accessible and flexible AEM solution. However, this capability also introduces vulnerabilities of arbitrary ``relocation" if misused by malicious user, such as facilitating advanced voice spoofing attacks or undermining the authenticity of recorded evidence. To address this issue, we propose EchoMark, the first deep learning-based AEM framework that generates perceptually similar RIRs with embedded watermark. Our design tackle the challenges posed by variable RIR characteristics, such as different durations and energy decays, by operating in the latent domain. By jointly optimizing the model with a perceptual loss for RIR reconstruction and a loss for watermark detection, EchoMark achieves both high-quality environment transfer and reliable watermark recovery. Experiments on diverse datasets validate that EchoMark achieves room acoustic parameter matching performance comparable to FiNS, the state-of-the-art RIR estimator. Furthermore, a high Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.22 out of 5, watermark detection accuracy exceeding 99\%, and bit error rates (BER) below 0.3\% collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of EchoMark in preserving perceptual quality while ensuring reliable watermark embedding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing NeRF-based methods encounter challenges in applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception, primarily due to the difficulty of capturing accurate camera poses and limitations in handling large-scale dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects. To address the ambiguity between camera motion and independent object motion, we design an effective and powerful training framework to achieve robust camera pose estimation and self-supervised decomposition of static and dynamic elements in a scene. Extensive evaluations on mainstream urban driving datasets demonstrate that VDNeRF surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF-based pose-free methods in both camera pose estimation and dynamic novel view synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |

To further support downstream speech understanding, we introduce a synthetic training pipeline and selectively fine-tune the encoder of a pre-trained ASR model. We implement mmSpeech with a commercial mmWave radar and validate its performance through extensive experiments. Results show that mmSpeech achieves state-of-the-art speech quality and generalizes well across unseen speakers and various conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional surrogate modeling approaches often incur high energy consumption, which severely limits their scalability and deployability in resource-constrained environments. We introduce NeuroPOL, \textit{the first neuroscience-inspired physics-informed operator learning framework} for reliability analysis. NeuroPOL incorporates Variable Spiking Neurons into a physics-informed operator architecture, replacing continuous activations with event-driven spiking dynamics. This innovation promotes sparse communication, significantly reduces computational load, and enables an energy-efficient surrogate model. The proposed framework lowers both computational and power demands, supporting real-time reliability assessment and deployment on edge devices and digital twins. By embedding governing physical laws into operator learning, NeuroPOL builds physics-consistent surrogates capable of accurate uncertainty propagation and efficient failure probability estimation, even for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate NeuroPOL on five canonical benchmarks, the Burgers equation, Nagumo equation, two-dimensional Poisson equation, two-dimensional Darcy equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with energy coupling. Results show that NeuroPOL achieves reliability measures comparable to standard physics-informed operators, while introducing significant communication sparsity, enabling scalable, distributed, and energy-efficient deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods rely on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which requires pairs of homologous points, pre-matched based on local image feature vectors. Sampling consensus is a core step in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms that enable computer systems to recognize patterns in data. In this paper, we propose H-RANSAC, an algorithm for homography estimation that eliminates the need for feature vectors or explicit point pairing, while it optionally supports point labeling into two classes. H-RANSAC introduces a novel geometric (cheiral) criterion that intelligently rejects implausible point configurations at the beginning of each iteration, while leveraging concave quadrilaterals typically discarded by similar algorithms. A post-hoc criterion at the end of each iteration improves accuracy further. Analytical derivations of the expected maximum iterations are provided, considering success probabilities and outlier rates, enabling adaptive performance tuning. The algorithm is validated on a demanding task: estimating homography between video frames of football matches captured by 12 cameras with highly divergent viewpoints. Results show that H-RANSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, combined with deep learning-based salient point detection, in terms of average reprojection error and success rates.

At each timestep, controllers compute commands using the current pose without waiting for future refinements. While traditional visual SLAM systems achieve high accuracy through retrospective loop closures, these corrections arrive after control decisions were already executed, violating causality. Visual-inertial odometry maintains causality but accumulates unbounded drift over time. To address the distinct requirements of robot control, we propose a multi-camera multi-map visual-inertial localization system providing real-time, causal pose estimation with bounded localization error through continuous map constraints. Since standard trajectory metrics evaluate post-processed trajectories, we analyze the error composition of map-based localization systems and propose a set of evaluation metrics suitable for measuring causal localization performance. To validate our system, we design a multi-camera IMU hardware setup and collect a challenging long-term campus dataset featuring diverse illumination and seasonal conditions. Experimental results on public benchmarks and on our own collected dataset demonstrate that our system provides significantly higher real-time localization accuracy compared to other methods.

In such robots, the primary role of a hand-eye camera is to accurately estimate 3D positions of graspable points (i.e., convex terrain surfaces) thanks to its close-up views. While conventional climbing robots often employ RGB-D cameras as hand-eye cameras to facilitate straightforward 3D terrain mapping and graspable point detection, RGB-D cameras are large and consume considerable power. This work presents a 3D terrain mapping system designed for space exploration using limbed climbing robots equipped with a monocular hand-eye camera. Compared to RGB-D cameras, monocular cameras are more lightweight, compact structures, and have lower power consumption. Although monocular SLAM can be used to construct 3D maps, it suffers from scale ambiguity. To address this limitation, we propose a SLAM method that fuses monocular visual constraints with limb forward kinematics. The proposed method jointly estimates time-series gripper poses and the global metric scale of the 3D map based on factor graph optimization. We validate the proposed framework through both physics-based simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that our framework constructs a metrically scaled 3D terrain map in real-time and enables autonomous grasping of convex terrain surfaces using a monocular hand-eye camera, without relying on RGB-D cameras. Our method contributes to scalable and energy-efficient perception for future space missions involving limbed climbing robots.

| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v8)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parse graphs have been widely used in Human Pose Estimation (HPE) to model the hierarchical structure and context relations of the human body. However, such methods often suffer from parameter redundancy. More importantly, they rely on predefined network structures, which limits their use in other methods. To address these issues, we propose a new context relation and hierarchical structure modeling module, RMPG (Refinement Module based on Parse Graph). RMPG adaptively refines feature maps through recursive top-down decomposition of feature maps and bottom-up composition of sub-node feature maps with context information. Through recursive hierarchical composition, RMPG fuses local details and global semantics into more structured feature representations, thereby improving HPE accuracy. RMPG can be flexibly embedded as a plug-in into various mainstream HPE networks. Moreover, by supervising sub-node features map, RMPG learns the context relations and hierarchical structure between different body parts with fewer parameters. Extensive experiments show that RMPG improves performance across different architectures while effectively modeling hierarchical and context relations of the human body with fewer parameters. The code will be found at https://github.com/lushbng/RMPG.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/lushbng/RMPG) |

Their compliance and complex, coupled dynamics, however, present modeling and control challenges, hindering path planning and obstacle avoidance. This paper presents a complete, open-source, and reproducible system that enables navigation for a 3-bar tensegrity robot. The system comprises: (i) an inexpensive, open-source hardware design, and (ii) an integrated, open-source software stack for physics-based modeling, system identification, state estimation, path planning, and control. All hardware and software are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/tensegrity-navigation/. The proposed system tracks the robot's pose and executes collision-free paths to a specified goal among known obstacle locations. System robustness is demonstrated through experiments involving unmodeled environmental challenges, including a vertical drop, an incline, and granular media, culminating in an outdoor field demonstration. To validate reproducibility, experiments were conducted using robot instances at two different laboratories. This work provides the robotics community with a complete navigation system for a compliant, impact-resistant, and shape-morphing robot. This system is intended to serve as a springboard for advancing the navigation capabilities of other unconventional robotic platforms.</p></details> |  | None |

However, establishing screw correspondence, especially in LAT views, remains a significant clinical challenge. This paper introduces a method to address pedicle screw correspondence and pose estimation from dual C-arm images. By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration. After registration, the correct combination further enhances alignment between projections and images, significantly reducing projection error. This approach shows promise for improving surgical outcomes in spinal procedures by providing reliable feedback on screw positioning.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to previous dynamic scene representations.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures | None |

While deep learning models using fundus images have significantly advanced the diagnosis of multiple eye diseases, variations in images from different imaging devices and locations (known as domain shifts) pose challenges for deploying pre-trained models in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a novel Fundus On-the-fly Test-Time Adaptation (FunOTTA) framework that effectively generalizes a fundus image diagnosis model to unseen environments, even under strong domain shifts. FunOTTA stands out for its stable adaptation process by performing dynamic disambiguation in the memory bank while minimizing harmful prior knowledge bias. We also introduce a new training objective during adaptation that enables the classifier to incrementally adapt to target patterns with reliable class conditional estimation and consistency regularization. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art test-time adaptation (TTA) pipelines. Experiments on cross-domain fundus image benchmarks across two diseases demonstrate the superiority of the overall framework and individual components under different backbone networks.

| **[Multi-modal Loop Closure Detection with Foundation Models in Severely Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05404v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation.

No Problem: Pose-Agnostic and Instance-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Monocular Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05055v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain) adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE, particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments. To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation network, by removing static objects including background components. To further boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map. Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework, PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable performance improvements in MDE during TTA.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose novel efficient solutions to this problem that are based on the simple idea of using four correspondences to estimate an approximate geometry of the first two views. We model this geometry either as an affine or a fully perspective geometry estimated using one additional approximate correspondence. We generate such an approximate correspondence using a very simple and efficient strategy, where the new point is the mean point of three corresponding input points. The new solvers are efficient and easy to implement, since they are based on existing efficient minimal solvers, i.e., the 4-point affine fundamental matrix, the well-known 5-point relative pose solver, and the P3P solver. Extensive experiments on real data show that the proposed solvers, when properly coupled with local optimization, achieve state-of-the-art results, with the novel solver based on approximate mean-point correspondences being more robust and accurate than the affine-based solver.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented at CVPR 2025 (DOI: 10.1109/CVPR52734.2025.02041).

| **[Deep Dictionary-Free Method for Identifying Linear Model of Nonlinear System with Input Delay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04451v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with input delays pose significant challenges for prediction, estimation, and control due to their inherent complexity and the impact of delays on system behavior. Traditional linear control techniques often fail in these contexts, necessitating innovative approaches. This paper introduces a novel approach to approximate the Koopman operator using an LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model, enabling linear representations of nonlinear systems with time delays. By incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, the proposed framework captures historical dependencies and efficiently encodes time-delayed system dynamics into a latent space. Unlike traditional extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) approaches that rely on predefined dictionaries, the LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model is dictionary-free, which mitigates the problems with the underlying dynamics being known and incorporated into the dictionary. Quantitative comparisons with extended eDMD on a simulated system demonstrate highly significant performance gains in prediction accuracy in cases where the true nonlinear dynamics are unknown and achieve comparable results to eDMD with known dynamics of a system.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the complicated maritime environment often causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore, a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features. Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories. Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise, occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

| **[Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet, the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly, 3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.</p></details> | 28 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Are Minimal Radial Distortion Solvers Necessary for Relative Pose Estimation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05984v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the relative pose between two cameras is a fundamental step in many applications such as Structure-from-Motion. The common approach to relative pose estimation is to apply a minimal solver inside a RANSAC loop. Highly efficient solvers exist for pinhole cameras. Yet, (nearly) all cameras exhibit radial distortion. Not modeling radial distortion leads to (significantly) worse results. However, minimal radial distortion solvers are significantly more complex than pinhole solvers, both in terms of run-time and implementation efforts. This paper compares radial distortion solvers with a simple-to-implement approach that combines an efficient pinhole solver with sampled radial distortion parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and RANSAC variants show that this simple approach performs similarly or better than the most accurate minimal distortion solvers at faster run-times while being significantly more accurate than faster non-minimal solvers. We clearly show that complex radial distortion solvers are not necessary in practice.

While landmark detection has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models, inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81% improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR). To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving 2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR.

Most methods rely solely on either egocentric-view images or sparse Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) signals, leading to inaccuracies due to self-occlusion in images or the sparseness and drift of inertial sensors. Most importantly, the lack of real-world datasets containing both modalities is a major obstacle to progress in this field. To overcome the barrier, we propose EMHI, a multimodal \textbf{E}gocentric human \textbf{M}otion dataset with \textbf{H}ead-Mounted Display (HMD) and body-worn \textbf{I}MUs, with all data collected under the real VR product suite. Specifically, EMHI provides synchronized stereo images from downward-sloping cameras on the headset and IMU data from body-worn sensors, along with pose annotations in SMPL format. This dataset consists of 885 sequences captured by 58 subjects performing 39 actions, totaling about 28.5 hours of recording. We evaluate the annotations by comparing them with optical marker-based SMPL fitting results. To substantiate the reliability of our dataset, we introduce MEPoser, a new baseline method for multimodal egocentric HPE, which employs a multimodal fusion encoder, temporal feature encoder, and MLP-based regression heads. The experiments on EMHI show that MEPoser outperforms existing single-modal methods and demonstrates the value of our dataset in solving the problem of egocentric HPE. We believe the release of EMHI and the method could advance the research of egocentric HPE and expedite the practical implementation of this technology in VR/AR products.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FusionDP: Foundation Model-Assisted Differentially Private Learning for Partially Sensitive Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03806v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility trade-off for various modalities.</p></details> |  | None |

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Back on Track: Bundle Adjustment for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14516v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional SLAM systems, which rely on bundle adjustment, struggle with highly dynamic scenes commonly found in casual videos. Such videos entangle the motion of dynamic elements, undermining the assumption of static environments required by traditional systems. Existing techniques either filter out dynamic elements or model their motion independently. However, the former often results in incomplete reconstructions, whereas the latter can lead to inconsistent motion estimates. Taking a novel approach, this work leverages a 3D point tracker to separate the camera-induced motion from the observed motion of dynamic objects. By considering only the camera-induced component, bundle adjustment can operate reliably on all scene elements as a result. We further ensure depth consistency across video frames with lightweight post-processing based on scale maps. Our framework combines the core of traditional SLAM -- bundle adjustment -- with a robust learning-based 3D tracker front-end. Integrating motion decomposition, bundle adjustment and depth refinement, our unified framework, BA-Track, accurately tracks the camera motion and produces temporally coherent and scale-consistent dense reconstructions, accommodating both static and dynamic elements. Our experiments on challenging datasets reveal significant improvements in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Oral.

In sensitive domains such as healthcare, privacy is enforced as a hard constraint, any shared data must satisfy a minimum privacy threshold. However, among all masking configurations that meet this requirement, the utility of the masked data can vary significantly, posing a key challenge: how to efficiently select the optimal configuration that preserves maximum utility. This paper presents Aegis, a middleware framework that selects optimal masking configurations for machine learning datasets with features and class labels. Aegis incorporates a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation, quantifying shifts in feature label correlations due to masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms) or none to estimate the feature label joint distribution, making it suitable for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature label correlation quantification methods such as mutual information, chi square, or g3. Our experimental evaluation of real world datasets shows that Aegis identifies optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks on par with baseline approaches and complements privacy anonymization data masking techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGMOD 2026</p></details> | None |

For a 2D image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches, estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss, encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features, which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair. Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model checkpoint will be made available to the public.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://diddone.github.io/densemarks/ .Video: https://youtu.be/o8DOOYFW0gI .21 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | [Code Link](https://diddone.github.io/densemarks) |

However, identifying damage in components like mooring systems from limited sensor data poses a challenging inverse problem, often characterized by multimodal solutions where various damage states could explain the observed response. To overcome it, we propose a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, where the encoder approximates the inverse operator, while the decoder approximates the forward. The posterior distribution of the latent space variables is probabilistically modeled, describing the uncertainties in the estimates. This work tackles the limitations of conventional Gaussian Mixtures used within VAEs, which can be either too restrictive or computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional spaces. We propose a novel Copula-based VAE architecture that decouples the marginal distribution of the variables from their dependence structure, offering a flexible method for representing complex, correlated posterior distributions. We provide a comprehensive comparison of three different approaches for approximating the posterior: a Gaussian Mixture with a diagonal covariance matrix, a Gaussian Mixture with a full covariance matrix, and a Gaussian Copula. Our analysis, conducted on a high-fidelity synthetic dataset, demonstrates that the Copula VAE offers a promising and tractable solution in high-dimensional spaces. Although the present work remains in the two-dimensional space, the results suggest efficient scalability to higher dimensions. It achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters than the Gaussian Mixture alternatives, whose parametrization grows prohibitively with the dimensionality. The results underscore the potential of Copula-based VAEs as a tool for uncertainty-aware damage identification in FOWT mooring systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Object Detection as an Optional Basis: A Graph Matching Network for Cross-View UAV Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02489v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas, satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations, or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps, such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Submitted to IEEE TIM</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git) |
| **[A New Perspective on Precision and Recall for Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02414v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research. The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Energy-Based Model for Accurate Estimation of Shapley Values in Feature Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01078v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shapley value is a widely used tool in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), as it provides a principled way to attribute contributions of input features to model outputs. However, estimation of Shapley value requires capturing conditional dependencies among all feature combinations, which poses significant challenges in complex data environments. In this article, EmSHAP (Energy-based model for Shapley value estimation), an accurate Shapley value estimation method, is proposed to estimate the expectation of Shapley contribution function under the arbitrary subset of features given the rest. By utilizing the ability of energy-based model (EBM) to model complex distributions, EmSHAP provides an effective solution for estimating the required conditional probabilities. To further improve estimation accuracy, a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)-coupled partition function estimation method is introduced. The GRU network captures long-term dependencies with a lightweight parameterization and maps input features into a latent space to mitigate the influence of feature ordering. Additionally, a dynamic masking mechanism is incorporated to further enhance the robustness and accuracy by progressively increasing the masking rate. Theoretical analysis on the error bound as well as application to four case studies verified the higher accuracy and better scalability of EmSHAP in contrast to competitive methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Our core innovation is a location solver that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone -- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery, and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion pipelines with bundle adjustment.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 spotlight paper</p></details> | None |

Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation, 3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025 workshop proceedings (Smart Cameras for Smarter Autonomous Vehicles & Robots)</p></details> | None |

Existing model-based estimation methods either assume constant curvature or rely on geometry-space interpolants, both of which struggle with accuracy under large deformations and sparse sensing. This letter introduces an integrated shape-force estimation framework that combines cable-tension measurements with tip-pose data to reconstruct backbone shape and estimate external tip force simultaneously. The framework employs polynomial curvature kinematics (PCK) and a virtual-work-based static formulation expressed directly in curvature space, where polynomial modal coefficients serve as generalized coordinates. The proposed method is validated through Cosserat-rod-based simulations and hardware experiments on a torque-cell-enabled CDCR prototype. Results show that the second-order PCK model achieves superior shape and force accuracy, combining a lightweight shape optimization with a closed-form, iteration-free force estimation, offering a compact and robust alternative to prior constant-curvature and geometry-space approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Statistical Analysis of Conditional Group Distributionally Robust Optimization with Cross-Entropy Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09905v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-source learning with discrete labels, distributional heterogeneity across domains poses a central challenge to developing predictive models that transfer reliably to unseen domains. We study multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation, where labeled data are available from multiple source domains and only unlabeled data are observed from the target domain. To address potential distribution shifts, we propose a novel Conditional Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (CG-DRO) framework that learns a classifier by minimizing the worst-case cross-entropy loss over the convex combinations of the conditional outcome distributions from sources domains. We develop an efficient Mirror Prox algorithm for solving the minimax problem and employ a double machine learning procedure to estimate the risk function, ensuring that errors in nuisance estimation contribute only at higher-order rates. We establish fast statistical convergence rates for the empirical CG-DRO estimator by constructing two surrogate minimax optimization problems that serve as theoretical bridges. A distinguishing challenge for CG-DRO is the emergence of nonstandard asymptotics: the empirical CG-DRO estimator may fail to converge to a standard limiting distribution due to boundary effects and system instability. To address this, we introduce a perturbation-based inference procedure that enables uniformly valid inference, including confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Impact of Near-Positivity Violations on IPTW-Estimated Marginal Structural Survival Models With Time-Dependent Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19606v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In longitudinal observational studies, marginal structural models (MSMs) are a class of causal models used to analyse the effect of an exposure on the (time-to-event) outcome of interest, while accounting for exposure-affected time-dependent confounding. In the applied literature, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) has been widely adopted to estimate MSMs. An essential assumption for IPTW-based MSMs is the positivity assumption, which ensures that, for any combination of measured confounders among individuals, there is a non-zero probability of receiving each possible treatment strategy. Positivity is crucial for valid causal inference through IPTW-based MSMs, but is often overlooked compared to confounding bias. Positivity violations may also arise due to randomness, in situations where the assignment to a specific treatment is theoretically possible but is either absent or rarely observed in the data, leading to near violations. These situations are common in practical applications, particularly when the sample size is small, and they pose significant challenges for causal inference. This study investigates the impact of near-positivity violations on estimates from IPTW-based MSMs in survival analysis. Two algorithms are proposed for simulating longitudinal data from hazard-MSMs, accommodating near-positivity violations, a time-varying binary exposure, and a time-to-event outcome. Cases of near-positivity violations, where remaining unexposed is rare within certain confounder levels, are analysed across various scenarios and weight truncation (WT) strategies. This work aims to serve as a critical warning against overlooking the positivity assumption or naively applying WT in causal studies using longitudinal observational data and IPTW.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The title has been changed in order to match the title of the published article available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bimj.70093</p></details> | None |
| **[Defining Energy Indicators for Impact Identification on Aerospace Composites: A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01592v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy estimation is critical to impact identification on aerospace composites, where low-velocity impacts can induce internal damage that is undetectable at the surface. Current methodologies for energy prediction are often constrained by data sparsity, signal noise, complex feature interdependencies, non-linear dynamics, massive design spaces, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. This study introduces a physics-informed framework that embeds domain knowledge into machine learning through a dedicated input space. The approach combines observational biases, which guide the design of physics-motivated features, with targeted feature selection to retain only the most informative indicators. Features are extracted from time, frequency, and time-frequency domains to capture complementary aspects of the structural response. A structured feature selection process integrating statistical significance, correlation filtering, dimensionality reduction, and noise robustness ensures physical relevance and interpretability. Exploratory data analysis further reveals domain-specific trends, yielding a reduced feature set that captures essential dynamic phenomena such as amplitude scaling, spectral redistribution, and transient signal behaviour. Together, these steps produce a compact set of energy-sensitive indicators with both statistical robustness and physical significance, resulting in impact energy predictions that remain interpretable and traceable to measurable structural responses. Using this optimised input space, a fully-connected neural network is trained and validated with experimental data from multiple impact scenarios, including pristine and damaged states. The resulting model demonstrates significantly improved impact energy prediction accuracy, reducing errors by a factor of three compared to conventional time-series techniques and purely data-driven models.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite advances in LiDAR inertial visual odometry (LIVO), its performance remains highly sensitive to extrinsic calibration. Meanwhile, 3D vision foundation models, such as VGGT, suffer from limited scalability in large environments and inherently lack metric scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose LiDAR-VGGT, a novel framework that tightly couples LiDAR inertial odometry with the state-of-the-art VGGT model through a two-stage coarse- to-fine fusion pipeline: First, a pre-fusion module with robust initialization refinement efficiently estimates VGGT poses and point clouds with coarse metric scale within each session. Then, a post-fusion module enhances cross-modal 3D similarity transformation, using bounding-box-based regularization to reduce scale distortions caused by inconsistent FOVs between LiDAR and camera sensors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that LiDAR-VGGT achieves dense, globally consistent colored point clouds and outperforms both VGGT-based methods and LIVO baselines. The implementation of our proposed novel color point cloud evaluation toolkit will be released as open source.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HGFreNet: Hop-hybrid GraphFomer for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Trajectory Consistency in Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01756v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>2D-to-3D human pose lifting is a fundamental challenge for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video, where graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and attention mechanisms have proven to be inherently suitable for encoding the spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joints. However, depth ambiguity and errors in 2D pose estimation lead to incoherence in the 3D trajectory. Previous studies have attempted to restrict jitters in the time domain, for instance, by constraining the differences between adjacent frames while neglecting the global spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joint motion. To tackle this problem, we design HGFreNet, a novel GraphFormer architecture with hop-hybrid feature aggregation and 3D trajectory consistency in the frequency domain. Specifically, we propose a hop-hybrid graph attention (HGA) module and a Transformer encoder to model global joint spatial-temporal correlations. The HGA module groups all $k$-hop neighbors of a skeletal joint into a hybrid group to enlarge the receptive field and applies the attention mechanism to discover the latent correlations of these groups globally. We then exploit global temporal correlations by constraining trajectory consistency in the frequency domain. To provide 3D information for depth inference across frames and maintain coherence over time, a preliminary network is applied to estimate the 3D pose. Extensive experiments were conducted on two standard benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results demonstrate that the proposed HGFreNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of positional accuracy and temporal consistency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SE(3)-PoseFlow: Estimating 6D Pose Distributions for Uncertainty-Aware Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01501v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in robotics and computer vision, yet it remains challenging due to partial observability, occlusions, and object symmetries, which inevitably lead to pose ambiguity and multiple hypotheses consistent with the same observation. While deterministic deep networks achieve impressive performance under well-constrained conditions, they are often overconfident and fail to capture the multi-modality of the underlying pose distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel probabilistic framework that leverages flow matching on the SE(3) manifold for estimating 6D object pose distributions. Unlike existing methods that regress a single deterministic output, our approach models the full pose distribution with a sample-based estimate and enables reasoning about uncertainty in ambiguous cases such as symmetric objects or severe occlusions. We achieve state-of-the-art results on Real275, YCB-V, and LM-O, and demonstrate how our sample-based pose estimates can be leveraged in downstream robotic manipulation tasks such as active perception for disambiguating uncertain viewpoints or guiding grasp synthesis in an uncertainty-aware manner.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Floor Plan-Guided Visual Navigation Incorporating Depth and Directional Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01493v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guiding an agent to a specific target in indoor environments based solely on RGB inputs and a floor plan is a promising yet challenging problem. Although existing methods have made significant progress, two challenges remain unresolved. First, the modality gap between egocentric RGB observations and the floor plan hinders the integration of visual and spatial information for both local obstacle avoidance and global planning. Second, accurate localization is critical for navigation performance, but remains challenging at deployment in unseen environments due to the lack of explicit geometric alignment between RGB inputs and floor plans. We propose a novel diffusion-based policy, denoted as GlocDiff, which integrates global path planning from the floor plan with local depth-aware features derived from RGB observations. The floor plan offers explicit global guidance, while the depth features provide implicit geometric cues, collectively enabling precise prediction of optimal navigation directions and robust obstacle avoidance. Moreover, GlocDiff introduces noise perturbation during training to enhance robustness against pose estimation errors, and we find that combining this with a relatively stable VO module during inference results in significantly improved navigation performance. Extensive experiments on the FloNa benchmark demonstrate GlocDiff's efficiency and effectiveness in achieving superior navigation performance, and the success of real-world deployments also highlights its potential for widespread practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

For this purpose, a passive 2-D global relocalization framework is proposed. It estimates the global pose efficiently and reliably from a single LiDAR scan and an occupancy grid map while the robot remains stationary, thereby enhancing the long-term autonomy of mobile robots. The proposed framework casts global relocalization as a non-convex problem and solves it via the multi-hypothesis scheme with batched multi-stage inference and early termination, balancing completeness and efficiency. The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), under traversability constraints, asymptotically covers the reachable space to generate sparse, uniformly distributed feasible positional hypotheses, fundamentally reducing the sampling space. The hypotheses are preliminarily ordered by the proposed Scan Mean Absolute Difference (SMAD), a coarse beam-error level metric that facilitates the early termination by prioritizing high-likelihood candidates. The SMAD computation is optimized for non-panoramic scans. And the Translation-Affinity Scan-to-Map Alignment Metric (TAM) is proposed for reliable orientation selection at hypothesized positions and accurate final pose evaluation to mitigate degradation in conventional likelihood-field metrics under translational uncertainty induced by sparse hypotheses, as well as non-panoramic LiDAR scan and environmental changes. Real-world experiments on a resource-constrained mobile robot with non-panoramic LiDAR scan demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in both global relocalization success rate and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures.

Recent data-driven approaches show the potential of single-view, non-invasive analysis, yet current animal video datasets are limited--offering as few as 2.4K 15-frame clips and lacking key processing for animal-centric 3D/4D tasks. We introduce an automated pipeline that mines YouTube videos and processes them into object-centric clips, along with auxiliary annotations valuable for downstream tasks like pose estimation, tracking, and 3D/4D reconstruction. Using this pipeline, we amass 30K videos (2M frames)--an order of magnitude more than prior works. To demonstrate its utility, we focus on the 4D quadruped animal reconstruction task. To support this task, we present Animal-in-Motion (AiM), a benchmark of 230 manually filtered sequences with 11K frames showcasing clean, diverse animal motions. We evaluate state-of-the-art model-based and model-free methods on Animal-in-Motion, finding that 2D metrics favor the former despite unrealistic 3D shapes, while the latter yields more natural reconstructions but scores lower--revealing a gap in current evaluation. To address this, we enhance a recent model-free approach with sequence-level optimization, establishing the first 4D animal reconstruction baseline. Together, our pipeline, benchmark, and baseline aim to advance large-scale, markerless 4D animal reconstruction and related tasks from in-the-wild videos.

Precise pose estimation is an important task for mobile robots exploring planetary surfaces, as they operate in GPS-denied environments. Although visual odometry provides accurate localization, it is computationally expensive and can fail in dim or high-contrast lighting. Wheel encoders can also provide odometry estimation, but are prone to slipping on the sandy terrain encountered on Mars. Although traditionally a scientific surveying sensor, GPR has been used on Earth for terrain classification and localization through subsurface feature matching. The Perseverance rover and the upcoming ExoMars rover have GPR sensors already equipped to aid in the search of water and mineral resources. We propose to leverage GPR to aid in Mars rover localization. Specifically, we develop a novel GPR-based deep learning model that predicts 1D relative pose translation. We fuse our GPR pose prediction method with inertial and wheel encoder data in a filtering framework to output rover localization. We perform experiments in a Mars analog environment and demonstrate that our GPR-based displacement predictions both outperform wheel encoders and improve multi-modal filtering estimates in high-slip environments.

Vision-based pose estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure, blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However, event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation.

The estimator combines bounded influence estimating equations for outcome modeling with covariate balancing propensity scores for treatment assignment, embedded within a penalized empirical likelihood framework using nonconvex regularization. It satisfies the oracle property by jointly achieving consistency under partial model correct ness, selection consistency, robustness to contamination, and asymptotic normality. For uncertainty quantification, we derive a finite sample confidence interval using cumulant generating functions and influence function corrections, avoiding reliance on asymptotic approximations. Simulation studies and applications to gene expression datasets (Golub and Khan) demonstrate superior performance in bias, error metrics, and interval calibration, highlighting the method robustness and inferential validity in HDLSS regimes. One notable aspect is that even in the absence of contamination, the proposed estimator and its confidence interval remain efficient compared to those of competing models.</p></details> |  | None |

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames.

To address these limitations, VLM6D, a novel dual-stream architecture that leverages the distinct strengths of visual and geometric data from RGB-D input for robust and precise pose estimation. Our framework uniquely integrates two specialized encoders: a powerful, self-supervised Vision Transformer (DINOv2) processes the RGB modality, harnessing its rich, pre-trained understanding of visual grammar to achieve remarkable resilience against texture and lighting variations.

| **[Bidirectional Regression for Monocular 6DoF Head Pose Estimation and Reference System Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14136v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) head pose estimation is crucial for safety-critical applications and human-computer interaction scenarios, yet existing monocular methods still struggle with robust pose estimation. We revisit this problem by introducing TRGv2, a lightweight extension of our previous Translation, Rotation, and Geometry (TRG) network, which explicitly models the bidirectional interaction between facial geometry and head pose. TRGv2 jointly infers facial landmarks and 6DoF pose through an iterative refinement loop with landmark-to-image projection, ensuring metric consistency among face size, rotation, and depth. To further improve generalization to out-of-distribution data, TRGv2 regresses correction parameters instead of directly predicting translation, combining them with a pinhole camera model for analytic depth estimation. In addition, we identify a previously overlooked source of bias in cross-dataset evaluations due to inconsistent head center definitions across different datasets. To address this, we propose a reference system alignment strategy that quantifies and corrects translation bias, enabling fair comparisons across datasets. Extensive experiments on ARKitFace, BIWI, and the challenging DD-Pose benchmarks demonstrate that TRGv2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency. Code and newly annotated landmarks for DD-Pose will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version extends the previously published preprint and has been submitted to Pattern Recognition</p></details> | None |

These devices require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance. We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AICCC 2025</p></details> | None |

At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI.

| **[Valid F-screening in linear regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23113v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Suppose that a data analyst wishes to report the results of a least squares linear regression only if the overall null hypothesis, $H_0^{1:p}: β_1= β_2 = \ldots = β_p=0$, is rejected. This practice, which we refer to as F-screening (since the overall null hypothesis is typically tested using an $F$-statistic), is in fact common practice across a number of applied fields. Unfortunately, it poses a problem: standard guarantees for the inferential outputs of linear regression, such as Type 1 error control of hypothesis tests and nominal coverage of confidence intervals, hold unconditionally, but fail to hold conditional on rejection of the overall null hypothesis. In this paper, we develop an inferential toolbox for the coefficients in a least squares model that are valid conditional on rejection of the overall null hypothesis. We develop selective p-values that lead to tests that are consistent and control the selective Type 1 error, i.e., the Type 1 error conditional on having rejected the overall null hypothesis. Furthermore, they can be computed without access to the raw data, i.e., using only the standard outputs of a least squares linear regression, and therefore are suitable for use in a retrospective analysis of a published study. We also develop confidence intervals that attain nominal selective coverage, and point estimates that account for having rejected the overall null hypothesis. We derive an expression for the Fisher information about the coefficients resulting from the proposed approach, and compare this to the Fisher information that results from an alternative approach that relies on sample splitting. We investigate the proposed approach in simulation and via re-analysis of two datasets from the biomedical literature.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cooperative Integrated Estimation-Guidance for Simultaneous Interception of Moving Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26948v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated estimation-guidance framework for simultaneous interception of a non-maneuvering target using a team of unmanned autonomous vehicles, assuming only a subset of vehicles are equipped with dedicated sensors to measure the target's states. Unlike earlier approaches that focus solely on either estimation or guidance design, the proposed framework unifies both within a cooperative architecture. To circumvent the limitation posed by heterogeneity in target observability, sensorless vehicles estimate the target's state by leveraging information exchanged with neighboring agents over a directed communication topology through a prescribed-time observer. The proposed approach employs true proportional navigation guidance (TPNG), which uses an exact time-to-go formulation and is applicable across a wide spectrum of target motions. Furthermore, prescribed-time observer and controller are employed to achieve convergence to true target's state and consensus in time-to-go within set predefined times, respectively. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under various engagement scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tight Differentially Private PCA via Matrix Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26679v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors $u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$ and the spectral gap $σ_r - σ_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas prior private algorithms failed to do so. In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including planted problems in graphs. We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular, we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>SODA ...</summary><p>SODA 2026; equal contribution</p></details> | None |
| **[ARECHO: Autoregressive Evaluation via Chain-Based Hypothesis Optimization for Speech Multi-Metric Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24518v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech signal analysis poses significant challenges, particularly in tasks such as speech quality evaluation and profiling, where the goal is to predict multiple perceptual and objective metrics. For instance, metrics like PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality), STOI (Short-Time Objective Intelligibility), and MOS (Mean Opinion Score) each capture different aspects of speech quality. However, these metrics often have different scales, assumptions, and dependencies, making joint estimation non-trivial. To address these issues, we introduce ARECHO (Autoregressive Evaluation via Chain-based Hypothesis Optimization), a chain-based, versatile evaluation system for speech assessment grounded in autoregressive dependency modeling. ARECHO is distinguished by three key innovations: (1) a comprehensive speech information tokenization pipeline; (2) a dynamic classifier chain that explicitly captures inter-metric dependencies; and (3) a two-step confidence-oriented decoding algorithm that enhances inference reliability. Experiments demonstrate that ARECHO significantly outperforms the baseline framework across diverse evaluation scenarios, including enhanced speech analysis, speech generation evaluation, and, noisy speech evaluation. Furthermore, its dynamic dependency modeling improves interpretability by capturing inter-metric relationships. Across tasks, ARECHO offers reference-free evaluation using its dynamic classifier chain to support subset queries (single or multiple metrics) and reduces error propagation via confidence-oriented decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> | None |
| **[Statistical Inference for Matching Decisions via Matrix Completion under Dependent Missingness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26478v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies decision-making and statistical inference for two-sided matching markets via matrix completion. In contrast to the independent sampling assumed in classical matrix completion literature, the observed entries, which arise from past matching data, are constrained by matching capacity. This matching-induced dependence poses new challenges for both estimation and inference in the matrix completion framework. We propose a non-convex algorithm based on Grassmannian gradient descent and establish near-optimal entrywise convergence rates for three canonical mechanisms, i.e., one-to-one matching, one-to-many matching with one-sided random arrival, and two-sided random arrival. To facilitate valid uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing on matching decisions, we further develop a general debiasing and projection framework for arbitrary linear forms of the reward matrix, deriving asymptotic normality with finite-sample guarantees under matching-induced dependent sampling. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach provides accurate estimation, valid confidence intervals, and efficient evaluation of matching policies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sketch2PoseNet: Efficient and Generalized Sketch to 3D Human Pose Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26196v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 | None |

To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.</p></details> |  | None |

By leveraging symmetry transformations, the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models, facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions, showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Seeing Clearly and Deeply: An RGBD Imaging Approach with a Bio-inspired Monocentric Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25314v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge: conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this, we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture. Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging.

However, the calibration of these platforms using forward kinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally generates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving platform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths connecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the difficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method. The authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using Denavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1 developed in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based calibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational upon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used their calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted three compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve the accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution digital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving platform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any additional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the hexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves multiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position and orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The Target poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations are estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses. Results from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable enhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 2024</p></details> | None |

However, employing these methods with costly forward models poses significant challenges, especially in the context of non-differentiable models, where the absence of likelihood model gradient information can result in high computational costs. To tackle this issue, we develop a novel Bayesian inference approach based on black box variational inference, utilizing importance sampling to reuse existing simulation model calls in the variational objective gradient estimation, without relying on forward model gradients. The novelty lies in a new batch-sequential sampling procedure, which only requires new model evaluations if the currently available model evaluations fail to yield a suitable approximation of the objective gradient. The resulting approach reduces computational costs by leading to variational parameter updates without requiring new model evaluations when possible, while adaptively increasing the number of model calls per iteration as needed. In combination with its black box nature, this new approach is suitable for inverse problems involving demanding physics-based models that lack model gradients. We demonstrate the efficiency gains of the proposed method compared to its baseline version, sequential Monte Carlo, and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo in diverse benchmarks, ranging from density matching to the Bayesian calibration of a nonlinear electro-chemo-mechanical model for solid-state batteries.</p></details> |  | None |

Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers' layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger inductive biases of explicit global pose.

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

However, its lack of environmental information poses significant challenges for obstacle avoidance. To address this issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative Non-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for UAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or obstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data from the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the quadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based method enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the UGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less than 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable environments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a modulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV cooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time trajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the need for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static and dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or unknown scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images). In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10 real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent work integrates Gaussian Splatting (GS) into SLAM to enable dense, photorealistic 3D mapping, yet existing GS-based SLAM methods require per-scene optimization that is slow and consumes an excessive number of Gaussians. We present GS4, the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM system. Compared with prior approaches, GS4 runs 10x faster, uses 10x fewer Gaussians, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across color, depth, semantic mapping and camera tracking. From an RGB-D video stream, GS4 incrementally builds and updates a set of 3D Gaussians using a feed-forward network. First, the Gaussian Prediction Model estimates a sparse set of Gaussian parameters from input frame, which integrates both color and semantic prediction with the same backbone. Then, the Gaussian Refinement Network merges new Gaussians with the existing set while avoiding redundancy. Finally, we propose to optimize GS for only 1-5 iterations that corrects drift and floaters when significant pose changes are detected. Experiments on the real-world ScanNet and ScanNet++ benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance, with strong generalization capability shown through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures | None |

In this paper, we present GeVI-SLAM, a gravity-enhanced stereo VI SLAM system designed to address these issues. By leveraging the stereo camera's direct depth estimation ability, we eliminate the need to estimate scale during IMU initialization, enabling stable operation even under low acceleration dynamics. With precise gravity initialization, we decouple the pitch and roll from the pose estimation and solve a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem for pose tracking. This allows the use of a minimal 3-point solver, which significantly reduces computational time to reject outliers within a Random Sample Consensus framework. We further propose a bias-eliminated 4-DOF PnP estimator with provable consistency, ensuring the relative pose converges to the true value as the feature number increases. To handle dynamic motion, we refine the full 6-DOF pose while jointly estimating the IMU covariance, enabling adaptive weighting of the gravity prior. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that GeVI-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and greater stability compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Acoustic Neural 3D Reconstruction Under Pose Drift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08930v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of optimizing neural implicit surfaces for 3D reconstruction using acoustic images collected with drifting sensor poses. The accuracy of current state-of-the-art 3D acoustic modeling algorithms is highly dependent on accurate pose estimation; small errors in sensor pose can lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the neural scene representation and sonar poses. Our algorithm does so by parameterizing the 6DoF poses as learnable parameters and backpropagating gradients through the neural renderer and implicit representation. We validated our algorithm on both real and simulated datasets. It produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions even under significant pose drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Gesplat: Robust Pose-Free 3D Reconstruction via Geometry-Guided Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10097v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A critical assessment of reinforcement learning methods for microswimmer navigation in complex flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05525v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating in a fluid flow while being carried by it, using only information accessible from on-board sensors, is a problem commonly faced by small planktonic organisms. It is also directly relevant to autonomous robots deployed in the oceans. In the last ten years, the fluid mechanics community has widely adopted reinforcement learning, often in the form of its simplest implementations, to address this challenge. But it is unclear how good are the strategies learned by these algorithms. In this paper, we perform a quantitative assessment of reinforcement learning methods applied to navigation in partially observable flows. We first introduce a well-posed problem of directional navigation for which a quasi-optimal policy is known analytically. We then report on the poor performance and robustness of commonly used algorithms (Q-Learning, Advantage Actor Critic) in flows regularly encountered in the literature: Taylor-Green vortices, Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, and two-dimensional turbulence. We show that they are vastly surpassed by PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), a more advanced algorithm that has established dominance across a wide range of benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community. In particular, our custom implementation of PPO matches the theoretical quasi-optimal performance in turbulent flow and does so in a robust manner. Reaching this result required the use of several additional techniques, such as vectorized environments and generalized advantage estimation, as well as hyperparameter optimization. This study demonstrates the importance of algorithm selection, implementation details, and fine-tuning for discovering truly smart autonomous navigation strategies in complex flows.</p></details> |  | None |

This work investigates the performance of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) in estimating the ground-state energy of the silicon atom, a relatively heavy element that poses significant computational complexity. Within a hybrid quantum-classical optimization framework, we implement VQE using a range of ansatz, including Double Excitation Gates, ParticleConservingU2, UCCSD, and k-UpCCGSD, combined with various optimizers such as gradient descent, SPSA, and ADAM. The main contribution of this work lies in a systematic methodological exploration of how these configuration choices interact to influence VQE performance, establishing a structured benchmark for selecting optimal settings in quantum chemical simulations. Key findings show that parameter initialization plays a decisive role in the algorithm's stability, and that the combination of a chemically inspired ansatz with adaptive optimization yields superior convergence and precision compared to conventional approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks. DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of the salinity variance.</p></details> |  | None |

Instead of relying on task-specific robot demonstrations collected via teleoperation, HAND uses easy-to-provide hand demonstrations to retrieve relevant behaviors from task-agnostic robot play data. Using a visual tracking pipeline, HAND extracts the motion of the human hand from the hand demonstration and retrieves robot sub-trajectories in two stages: first filtering by visual similarity, then retrieving trajectories with similar behaviors to the hand. Fine-tuning a policy on the retrieved data enables real-time learning of tasks in under four minutes, without requiring calibrated cameras or detailed hand pose estimation. Experiments also show that HAND outperforms retrieval baselines by over 2x in average task success rates on real robots.

However, existing methods often rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SABlock: Semantic-Aware KV Cache Eviction with Adaptive Compression Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22556v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference. While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically, SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9% retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Policies over Poses: Reinforcement Learning based Distributed Pose-Graph Optimization for Multi-Robot SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22740v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5% more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger robot teams without any retraining.

Yet, agricultural applications remain constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock, especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations - a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments. While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87, PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 6 Tables</p></details> | None |

However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view, leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.</p></details> |  | None |

A critical yet challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.

| **[Root Cause Analysis of Outliers with Missing Structural Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05014v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is to explain why an anomaly occurred by identifying where the fault originated. Several recent works model the anomalous event as resulting from a change in the causal mechanism at the root cause, i.e., as a soft intervention. RCA is then the task of identifying which causal mechanism changed. In real-world applications, one often has either few or only a single sample from the post-intervention distribution: a severe limitation for most methods, which assume one knows or can estimate the distribution. However, even those that do not are statistically ill-posed due to the need to probe regression models in regions of low probability density. In this paper, we propose simple, efficient methods to overcome both difficulties in the case where there is a single root cause and the causal graph is a polytree. When one knows the causal graph, we give guarantees for a traversal algorithm that requires only marginal anomaly scores and does not depend on specifying an arbitrary anomaly score cut-off. When one does not know the causal graph, we show that the heuristic of identifying root causes as the variables with the highest marginal anomaly scores is causally justified. To this end, we prove that anomalies with small scores are unlikely to cause those with larger scores in polytrees and give upper bounds for the likelihood of causal pathways with non-monotonic anomaly scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

The task poses significant challenges due to extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS) Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting.

Traditional LIO algorithms perform poorly when dynamic objects dominate the scenes, particularly in geometrically sparse environments. Current approaches to dynamic LIO face a fundamental challenge: accurate localization requires a reliable identification of static features, yet distinguishing dynamic objects necessitates precise pose estimation. Our solution breaks this circular dependency by integrating dynamic awareness directly into the point cloud registration process. We introduce a novel dynamic-aware iterative closest point algorithm that leverages spatio-temporal normal analysis, complemented by an efficient spatial consistency verification method to enhance static map construction.

In general, we must construct such a 3D interpretation of a complex scene based on limited input, such as a single RGB-D image. We describe SceneComplete, a system for constructing a complete, segmented, 3D model of a scene from a single view. SceneComplete is a novel pipeline for composing general-purpose pretrained perception modules (vision-language, segmentation, image-inpainting, image-to-3D, visual-descriptors and pose-estimation) to obtain highly accurate results. We demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness with respect to ground-truth models in a large benchmark dataset and show that its accurate whole-object reconstruction enables robust grasp proposal generation, including for a dexterous hand.

Under positivity violations, available methods result in either treatment effect estimators with substantial statistical bias and variance or estimators corresponding to a modified estimand and target population that is misaligned with the original research question. To address these challenges, we propose partially retargeted balancing weights, which yield reduced estimator variance under positivity violations by modifying the target population for only a subset of covariates. Our weights can be derived under a novel relaxed positivity assumption allowing the calculation of valid balancing weights even when positivity does not hold. Our proposed weighted estimator is consistent for the original target estimand when either 1) the implied propensity score model is correct; or 2) the subset of covariates whose population is not modified contains all treatment effect modifiers. When these conditions do not hold, our estimator is consistent for a slightly modified treatment effect estimand. Furthermore, our proposed weighted estimator has reduced asymptotic variance when positivity does not hold. We evaluate our weights and corresponding estimator through applications to synthetic data, an EHR study, and when transporting an RCT treatment effect to a Midwestern population.</p></details> | 60 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, traditional deep learning frameworks designed for conventional cameras struggle with the asynchronous, stream-like nature of event data, as their architectures are optimized for discrete, image-like inputs. We propose a scalable, flexible and adaptable framework for pixel-wise depth estimation with event cameras in both monocular and stereo setups. The 3D scene structure is encoded into disparity space images (DSIs), representing spatial densities of rays obtained by back-projecting events into space via known camera poses. Our neural network processes local subregions of the DSIs combining 3D convolutions and a recurrent structure to recognize valuable patterns for depth prediction. Local processing enables fast inference with full parallelization and ensures constant ultra-low model complexity and memory costs, regardless of camera resolution. Experiments on standard benchmarks (MVSEC and DSEC datasets) demonstrate unprecedented effectiveness: (i) using purely monocular data, our method achieves comparable results to existing stereo methods; (ii) when applied to stereo data, it strongly outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, reducing the mean absolute error by at least 42%; (iii) our method also allows for increases in depth completeness by more than 3-fold while still yielding a reduction in median absolute error of at least 30%. Given its remarkable performance and effective processing of event-data, our framework holds strong potential to become a standard approach for using deep learning for event-based depth estimation and SLAM.

Prior work from Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$ Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$ learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable, solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).</p></details> |  | None |

Red teaming improves SID's effectiveness by identifying and exploiting their failure modes via misclassified synthetic images. However, existing red-teaming solutions (i) require white-box access to SIDs, which is infeasible for proprietary state-of-the-art detectors, and (ii) generate image-specific attacks through expensive online optimization. To address these limitations, we propose PolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs, based on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples correctly and incorrectly classified by the SID. PolyJuice generates attacks by (i) identifying the direction of this shift through a lightweight offline process that only requires black-box access to the SID, and (ii) exploiting this direction by universally steering all generated images towards the SID's failure modes. PolyJuice-steered T2I models are significantly more effective at deceiving SIDs (up to 84%) compared to their unsteered counterparts. We also show that the steering directions can be estimated efficiently at lower resolutions and transferred to higher resolutions using simple interpolation, reducing computational overhead. Finally, tuning SID models on PolyJuice-augmented datasets notably enhances the performance of the detectors (up to 30%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as NeurIPS 2025 poster</p></details> | None |

They are useful for studying scaling laws and speeding up hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone (i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves Database 1.1 (LCDB 1.1), a large-scale database with high-resolution learning curves including more modern learners (CatBoost, TabNet, RealMLP and TabPFN), we show that learning curves are less often well-behaved than previously thought. Using statistically rigorous methods, we observe significant ill-behavior in approximately 15% of the learning curves, almost twice as much as in previous estimates. We also identify which learners are to blame and show that specific learners are more ill-behaved than others. Additionally, we demonstrate that different feature scalings rarely resolve ill-behavior. We evaluate the impact of ill-behavior on downstream tasks, such as learning curve fitting and model selection, and find it poses significant challenges, underscoring the relevance and potential of LCDB 1.1 as a challenging benchmark for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Datasets & Benchmarks Track</p></details> | None |
