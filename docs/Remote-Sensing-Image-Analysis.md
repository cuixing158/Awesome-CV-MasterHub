| **[Advancing Image Super-resolution Techniques in Remote Sensing: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23248v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) is a crucial task in remote sensing image processing, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Despite the growing number of RSISR methods proposed in recent years, a systematic and comprehensive review of these methods is still lacking. This paper presents a thorough review of RSISR algorithms, covering methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We provide an in-depth analysis of RSISR methods, categorizing them into supervised, unsupervised, and quality evaluation approaches, to help researchers understand current trends and challenges. Our review also discusses the strengths, limitations, and inherent challenges of these techniques. Notably, our analysis reveals significant limitations in existing methods, particularly in preserving fine-grained textures and geometric structures under large-scale degradation. Based on these findings, we outline future research directions, highlighting the need for domain-specific architectures and robust evaluation protocols to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world RSISR scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</p></details> | None |
| **[Semantic Segmentation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing Images using SegFormer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01092v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The escalating use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as remote sensing platforms has garnered considerable attention, proving invaluable for ground object recognition. While satellite remote sensing images face limitations in resolution and weather susceptibility, UAV remote sensing, employing low-speed unmanned aircraft, offers enhanced object resolution and agility. The advent of advanced machine learning techniques has propelled significant strides in image analysis, particularly in semantic segmentation for UAV remote sensing images. This paper evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of SegFormer, a semantic segmentation framework, for the semantic segmentation of UAV images. SegFormer variants, ranging from real-time (B0) to high-performance (B5) models, are assessed using the UAVid dataset tailored for semantic segmentation tasks. The research details the architecture and training procedures specific to SegFormer in the context of UAV semantic segmentation. Experimental results showcase the model's performance on benchmark dataset, highlighting its ability to accurately delineate objects and land cover features in diverse UAV scenarios, leading to both high efficiency and performance.</p></details> |  | None |

We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

| **[Understanding What Is Not Said:Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation with Scarce Expressions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22760v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) aims to segment instances in remote sensing images according to referring expressions. Unlike Referring Image Segmentation on general images, acquiring high-quality referring expressions in the remote sensing domain is particularly challenging due to the prevalence of small, densely distributed objects and complex backgrounds. This paper introduces a new learning paradigm, Weakly Referring Expression Learning (WREL) for RRSIS, which leverages abundant class names as weakly referring expressions together with a small set of accurate ones to enable efficient training under limited annotation conditions. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that mixed-referring training yields a provable upper bound on the performance gap relative to training with fully annotated referring expressions, thereby establishing the validity of this new setting. We also propose LRB-WREL, which integrates a Learnable Reference Bank (LRB) to refine weakly referring expressions through sample-specific prompt embeddings that enrich coarse class-name inputs. Combined with a teacher-student optimization framework using dynamically scheduled EMA updates, LRB-WREL stabilizes training and enhances cross-modal generalization under noisy weakly referring supervision. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark with varying weakly referring data ratios validate both the theoretical insights and the practical effectiveness of WREL and LRB-WREL, demonstrating that they can approach or even surpass models trained with fully annotated referring expressions.</p></details> |  | None |

With powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks. Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping, agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Do Satellite Tasks Need Special Pretraining?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17014v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities, including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID, an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces TinyRS, the first 2B-parameter multimodal small language model (MSLM) optimized for remote sensing tasks, and TinyRS-R1, its reasoning-augmented variant. Built upon Qwen2-VL-2B, TinyRS is trained through a four-stage pipeline: pre-training on million satellite images, instruction tuning on visual instruction examples, fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations from the proposed reasoning dataset, and alignment via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). TinyRS-R1 achieves or surpasses the performance of recent 7B-parameter remote sensing models across classification, VQA, visual grounding, and open-ended question answering-while requiring just one-third of the memory and latency. Our analysis shows that CoT reasoning substantially benefits spatial grounding and scene understanding, while the non-reasoning TinyRS excels in concise, latency-sensitive VQA tasks. TinyRS-R1 represents the first domain-specialized MSLM with GRPO-aligned CoT reasoning for general-purpose remote sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (GRSL).

| **[GeoVLM-R1: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Improved Remote Sensing Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25026v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning, change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

| **[A Comprehensive Review of Diffusion Models in Smart Agriculture: Progress, Applications, and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18376v6)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the global population increasing and arable land resources becoming increasingly limited, smart and precision agriculture have emerged as essential directions for sustainable agricultural development. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning models, has been widely adopted in applications such as crop monitoring, pest detection, and yield prediction. Among recent generative models, diffusion models have demonstrated considerable potential in agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote sensing analysis. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models exhibit greater training stability and superior image generation quality, effectively addressing challenges such as limited annotated datasets and imbalanced sample distributions in agricultural scenarios. This paper reviews recent advancements in the application of diffusion models within agriculture, focusing on their roles in crop disease and pest detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth prediction, and agricultural resource management. Diffusion models have been found useful in improving tasks like image generation, denoising, and data augmentation in agriculture, especially when environmental noise or variability is present. While their high computational requirements and limited generalizability across domains remain concerns, the approach is gradually proving effective in real-world applications such as precision crop monitoring. As research progresses, these models may help support sustainable agriculture and address emerging challenges in food systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments. Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained. The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables.

| **[A Spatial-Spectral-Frequency Interactive Network for Multimodal Remote Sensing Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04628v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in remote sensing Earth observation data analysis. Numerous feature fusion techniques address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity. In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Balanced Diffusion-Guided Fusion for Multimodal Remote Sensing Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23310v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However, pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance.

| **[Zero-Shot Multi-Spectral Learning: Reimagining a Generalist Multimodal Gemini 2.5 Model for Remote Sensing Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19087v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification, and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat, only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore, although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand specialized multi-spectral signals. To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities, grounded in the specialized sensor data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DragOSM: Extract Building Roofs and Footprints from Aerial Images by Aligning Historical Labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17951v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting polygonal roofs and footprints from remote sensing images is critical for large-scale urban analysis. Most existing methods rely on segmentation-based models that assume clear semantic boundaries of roofs, but these approaches struggle in off- nadir images, where the roof and footprint are significantly displaced, and facade pixels are fused with the roof boundary. With the increasing availability of open vector map annotations, e.g., OpenStreetMap, utilizing historical labels for off-nadir image annotation has become viable because remote sensing images are georeferenced once captured. However, these historical labels commonly suffer from significant positional discrepancies with new images and only have one annotation (roof or footprint), which fails to describe the correct structures of a building. To address these discrepancies, we first introduce a concept of an alignment token, which encodes the correction vector to guide the label correction. Based on this concept, we then propose Drag OpenStreetMap Labels (DragOSM), a novel model designed to align dislocated historical labels with roofs and footprints. Specifically, DragOSM formulates the label alignment as an interactive denoising process, modeling the positional discrepancy as a Gaussian distribution. During training, it learns to correct these errors by simulating misalignment with random Gaussian perturbations; during inference, it iteratively refines the positions of input labels. To validate our method, we further present a new dataset, Repairing Buildings in OSM (ReBO), comprising 179,265 buildings with both OpenStreetMap and manually corrected annotations across 5,473 images from 41 cities. Experimental results on ReBO demonstrate the effectiveness of DragOSM. Code, dataset, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/likaiucas/DragOSM.git.</p></details> | 17 Pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/likaiucas/DragOSM.git) |

While single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

Currently, the overall trend for monitoring and assessing forest carbon stocks is to integrate ground monitoring sample data with satellite remote sensing imagery. This style of analysis facilitates large-scale observation. However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and Landsat TM images to analyze Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province in China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon stock estimation into an image translation.</p></details> |  | None |

Analysis of the hyperspectral images with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation properties as tree representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Comprehensive Review of Agricultural Parcel and Boundary Delineation from Remote Sensing Images: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14558v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis, including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1) traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest, decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and tendency.</p></details> |  | None |

Considering the high-mobility characteristics of satellite channels and limited processing capabilities of satellite payloads, we propose an integrated communication and remote sensing architecture based on an orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) signal waveform. Both communication and SAR imaging functionalities are achieved with an integrated transceiver onboard the LEO satellite, utilizing the same waveform and radio frequency (RF) front-end. Based on such an architecture, we propose a transmission protocol compatible with the 5G NR standard using downlink pilots for joint channel estimation and SAR imaging. Furthermore, we design a unified signal processing framework for the integrated satellite receiver to simultaneously achieve high-performance channel sensing, low-complexity channel equalization and interference-free SAR imaging. Finally, the performance of the proposed integrated system is demonstrated through comprehensive analysis and extensive simulations in the sub-6 GHz band. Moreover, a software-defined radio (SDR) prototype is presented to validate its effectiveness for real-time SAR imaging and information transmission in satellite direct-connect user equipment (UE) scenarios within the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Remote Sensing Image Intelligent Interpretation with the Language-Centered Perspective: Principles, Methods and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06832v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been dominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic understanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling multi-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making. While recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote sensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications, lacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of language. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to language-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a language-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs as the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action spaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We first explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in remote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges, including unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and reasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered solutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research directions from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task understanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and autonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for the next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a roadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LSKNet: A Foundation Lightweight Backbone for Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11735v6)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing images pose distinct challenges for downstream tasks due to their inherent complexity. While a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, most of these studies have overlooked the valuable prior knowledge embedded within remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be useful because remote sensing objects may be mistakenly recognized without referencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different objects. This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone. LSKNet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing images. Without bells and whistles, our lightweight LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art scores on standard remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our comprehensive analysis further validated the significance of the identified priors and the effectiveness of LSKNet.

However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities: visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral, and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories, instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Convolutional and Graph Networks for an Unsupervised Remote Sensing Labelling Tool](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00506v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work, we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be formed within the encoding space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video supplement demonstrating feature-space exploration and interactive labelling is available at: https://youtu.be/GZl1ebZJgEA and is archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16676591</p></details> | None |
| **[IAMAP: Unlocking Deep Learning in QGIS for non-coders and limited computing resources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00627v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing has entered a new era with the rapid development of artificial intelligence approaches. However, the implementation of deep learning has largely remained restricted to specialists and has been impractical because it often requires (i) large reference datasets for model training and validation; (ii) substantial computing resources; and (iii) strong coding skills. Here, we introduce IAMAP, a user-friendly QGIS plugin that addresses these three challenges in an easy yet flexible way. IAMAP builds on recent advancements in self-supervised learning strategies, which now provide robust feature extractors, often referred to as foundation models. These generalist models can often be reliably used in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios (i.e., with little to no fine-tuning). IAMAP's interface allows users to streamline several key steps in remote sensing image analysis: (i) extracting image features using a wide range of deep learning architectures; (ii) reducing dimensionality with built-in algorithms; (iii) performing clustering on features or their reduced representations; (iv) generating feature similarity maps; and (v) calibrating and validating supervised machine learning models for prediction. By enabling non-AI specialists to leverage the high-quality features provided by recent deep learning approaches without requiring GPU capacity or extensive reference datasets, IAMAP contributes to the democratization of computationally efficient and energy-conscious deep learning methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, existing methods typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and (3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal large language models and remote sensing vision-language models.

This restricts their applicability in diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$ ($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary $\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that, our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis.

| **[Good Representation, Better Explanation: Role of Convolutional Neural Networks in Transformer-Based Remote Sensing Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16095v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) is the process of generating meaningful descriptions from remote sensing images. Recently, it has gained significant attention, with encoder-decoder models serving as the backbone for generating meaningful captions. The encoder extracts essential visual features from the input image, transforming them into a compact representation, while the decoder utilizes this representation to generate coherent textual descriptions. Recently, transformer-based models have gained significant popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information. The decoder has been well explored for text generation, whereas the encoder remains relatively unexplored. However, optimizing the encoder is crucial as it directly influences the richness of extracted features, which in turn affects the quality of generated captions. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate twelve different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures within a transformer-based encoder framework to assess their effectiveness in RSIC. The evaluation consists of two stages: first, a numerical analysis categorizes CNNs into different clusters, based on their performance. The best performing CNNs are then subjected to human evaluation from a human-centric perspective by a human annotator. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different search strategies, namely greedy search and beam search, to ensure the best caption. The results highlight the critical role of encoder selection in improving captioning performance, demonstrating that specific CNN architectures significantly enhance the quality of generated descriptions for remote sensing images. By providing a detailed comparison of multiple encoders, this study offers valuable insights to guide advances in transformer-based image captioning models.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, they are capable of interacting with users in a conversational manner. In this paper, we aim to provide the remote sensing community with a timely and comprehensive review of the developments in VLM using the two-stage paradigm. Specifically, we first cover a taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing: contrastive learning, visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image generation. For each category, we detail the commonly used network architecture and pre-training objectives. Second, we conduct a thorough review of existing works, examining foundation models and task-specific adaptation methods in contrastive-based VLM, architectural upgrades, training strategies and model capabilities in instruction-based VLM, as well as generative foundation models with their representative downstream applications. Third, we summarize datasets used for VLM pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, with an analysis of their construction methodologies (including image sources and caption generation) and key properties, such as scale and task adaptability.

Semantic segmentation (SS) of RSIs enables the fine-grained interpretation of surface features, making it a critical task in remote sensing analysis. With the increasing diversity and volume of RSIs collected by sensors on various platforms, traditional processing methods struggle to maintain efficiency and accuracy. In response, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling substantial advances in remote sensing image semantic segmentation (RSISS) by automating feature extraction and improving segmentation accuracy across diverse modalities. This paper revisits the evolution of DL-based RSISS by categorizing existing approaches into four stages: the early pixel-based methods, the prevailing patch-based and tile-based techniques, and the emerging image-based strategies enabled by foundation models. We analyze these developments from the perspective of feature extraction and learning strategies, revealing the field's progression from pixel-level to tile-level and from unimodal to multimodal segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nearly 40 advanced techniques on a unified dataset to quantitatively characterize their performance and applicability.

If choose to resize the UHR image to standard input image size, the extensive spatial and contextual information that UHR images contain will be neglected. Otherwise, the original size of these images often exceeds the token limits of standard RSMLLMs, making it difficult to process the entire image and capture long-range dependencies to answer the query based on the abundant visual context. In this paper, we introduce ImageRAG for RS, a training-free framework to address the complexities of analyzing UHR remote sensing imagery. By transforming UHR remote sensing image analysis task to image's long context selection task, we design an innovative image contextual retrieval mechanism based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, denoted as ImageRAG. ImageRAG's core innovation lies in its ability to selectively retrieve and focus on the most relevant portions of the UHR image as visual contexts that pertain to a given query. Fast path and slow path are proposed in this framework to handle this task efficiently and effectively. ImageRAG allows RSMLLMs to manage extensive context and spatial information from UHR RSI, ensuring the analysis is both accurate and efficient.

However, few studies have discussed its application to remote sensing imagery, where click-based interactive segmentation could greatly facilitate the analysis of complicated landscapes. This study aims to bridge the gap between click-based interactive segmentation and remote sensing image analysis by conducting a benchmark study on various click-based interactive segmentation models. We assessed the performance of five state-of-the-art interactive segmentation methods (Reviving Iterative Training with Mask Guidance for Interactive Segmentation (RITM), FocalClick, SimpleClick, Iterative Click Loss (ICL), and Segment Anything (SAM)) on two high-resolution aerial imagery datasets. The Cascade-Forward Refinement (CFR) approach, an innovative inference strategy for interactive segmentation, was also introduced to enhance the segmentation results without requiring manual efforts. We further integrated CFR into all models for comparison. The performance of these methods on various land cover types, different object sizes, and multiple band combinations in the datasets was evaluated. The SimpleClick-CFR model consistently outperformed the other methods in our experiments. Building upon these findings, we developed a dedicated online tool called SegMap for interactive segmentation of remote sensing data. SegMap incorporates a well-performing interactive model that is fine-tuned with remote sensing data. Unlike existing interactive segmentation tools, SegMap offers robust interactivity, modifiability, and adaptability to analyze remote sensing imagery.</p></details> |  | None |

In this context, foundation models facilitate remote sensing image analysis to retrieve relevant geoinformation accurately and efficiently. However, as these models grow in size, fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging due to the associated computational resources and costs, limiting their accessibility and scalability. Furthermore, full fine-tuning can lead to forgetting pre-trained features and even degrade model generalization. To address this, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques offer a promising solution. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments with various foundation model architectures and PEFT techniques to evaluate their effectiveness on five different EO datasets. Our results provide a comprehensive comparison, offering insights into when and how PEFT methods support the adaptation of pre-trained geospatial models. We demonstrate that PEFT techniques match or even exceed full fine-tuning performance and enhance model generalisation to unseen geographic regions, while reducing training time and memory requirements. Additional experiments investigate the effect of architecture choices such as the decoder type or the use of metadata, suggesting UNet decoders and fine-tuning without metadata as the recommended configuration. We have integrated all evaluated foundation models and techniques into the open-source package TerraTorch to support quick, scalable, and cost-effective model adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/IBM/peft-geofm</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/IBM/peft-geofm) |

However, SAR image interpretation remains challenging due to its complex physical imaging mechanisms and significant visual disparities from human perception. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in RGB image understanding, offering powerful open-vocabulary interpretation and flexible language interaction. However, their application to SAR images is severely constrained by the absence of SAR-specific knowledge in their training distributions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce SARLANG-1M, a large-scale benchmark tailored for multimodal SAR image understanding, with a primary focus on integrating SAR with textual modality. SARLANG-1M comprises more than 1 million high-quality SAR image-text pairs collected from over 59 cities worldwide. It features hierarchical resolutions (ranging from 0.1 to 25 meters), fine-grained semantic descriptions (including both concise and detailed captions), diverse remote sensing categories (1,696 object types and 16 land cover classes), and multi-task question-answering pairs spanning seven applications and 1,012 question types. Extensive experiments on mainstream VLMs demonstrate that fine-tuning with SARLANG-1M significantly enhances their performance in SAR image interpretation, reaching performance comparable to human experts.

While deep learning methods have shown promise in automating sea ice segmentation, they often rely on extensive labeled datasets which require expert knowledge and are time-consuming to create. Recently, foundation models (FMs) have shown excellent results for segmenting remote sensing images by utilizing pre-training on large datasets using self-supervised techniques. However, their effectiveness for sea ice segmentation remains unexplored, especially given sea ice's complex structures, seasonal changes, and unique spectral signatures, as well as peculiar Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery characteristics including banding and scalloping noise, and varying ice backscatter characteristics, which are often missing in standard remote sensing pre-training datasets. In particular, SAR images over polar regions are acquired using different modes than used to capture the images at lower latitudes by the same sensors that form training datasets for FMs. This study evaluates ten remote sensing FMs for sea ice type segmentation using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, focusing on their seasonal and spatial generalization. Among the selected models, Prithvi-600M outperforms the baseline models, while CROMA achieves a very similar performance in F1-score. Our contributions include offering a systematic methodology for selecting FMs for sea ice data analysis, a comprehensive benchmarking study on performances of FMs for sea ice segmentation with tailored performance metrics, and insights into existing gaps and future directions for improving domain-specific models in polar applications using SAR data.</p></details> |  | None |

These models combine various data modalities, such as optical, radar, and LiDAR imagery, with textual and geographic information, enabling more comprehensive analysis and understanding of remote sensing data. The integration of multiple modalities allows for improved performance in tasks like object detection, land cover classification, and change detection, which are often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data.

Moreover, the computational demands of training and fine-tuning multimodal models require significant resources, further complicating their practical application in remote sensing image interpretation tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in vision and multimodal foundation models for remote sensing, focusing on their architecture, training methods, datasets and application scenarios.

The goal is to improve target boundary accuracy and segmentation consistency. Built upon the Mask2Former framework, this method constructs a boundary-aware feature map and introduces a feature bridging mechanism. This enables effective cross-scale feature fusion, enhancing the model's ability to focus on target boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that, compared to mainstream segmentation methods, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in metrics such as mIOU, mDICE, and mRecall. It also exhibits superior boundary retention in complex scenes. Visual analysis further confirms the model's advantages in fine-grained regions.

While CNNs excel at local feature extraction via parameter sharing, their fixed receptive fields fundamentally restrict long-range dependency modeling. Vision Transformers (ViTs) effectively capture global semantic relationships through self-attention mechanisms but suffer from quadratic computational complexity relative to image resolution, creating critical efficiency bottlenecks for high-resolution imagery.

To address these challenges, we propose RSRWKV, featuring a novel 2D-WKV scanning mechanism that bridges sequential processing and 2D spatial reasoning while maintaining linear complexity. This enables isotropic context aggregation across multiple directions. The MVC-Shift module enhances multi-scale receptive field coverage, while the ECA module strengthens cross-channel feature interaction and semantic saliency modeling.

Natural language presents an intuitive interface for accessing, querying, and interpreting the data from such archives. However, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS. This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis. GAIA comprises of 205,150 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions. Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena. The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures | None |

| **[reBEN: Refined BigEarthNet Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03653v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents refined BigEarthNet (reBEN) that is a large-scale, multi-modal remote sensing dataset constructed to support deep learning (DL) studies for remote sensing image analysis. The reBEN dataset consists of 549,488 pairs of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches. To construct reBEN, we initially consider the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 tiles used to construct the BigEarthNet dataset and then divide them into patches of size 1200 m x 1200 m. We apply atmospheric correction to the Sentinel-2 patches using the latest version of the sen2cor tool, resulting in higher-quality patches compared to those present in BigEarthNet. Each patch is then associated with a pixel-level reference map and scene-level multi-labels. This makes reBEN suitable for pixel- and scene-based learning tasks. The labels are derived from the most recent CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map of 2018 by utilizing the 19-class nomenclature as in BigEarthNet. The use of the most recent CLC map results in overcoming the label noise present in BigEarthNet. Furthermore, we introduce a new geographical-based split assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the spatial correlation among the train, validation, and test sets with respect to those present in BigEarthNet. This increases the reliability of the evaluation of DL models. To minimize the DL model training time, we introduce software tools that convert the reBEN dataset into a DL-optimized data format. In our experiments, we show the potential of reBEN for multi-modal multi-label image classification problems by considering several state-of-the-art DL models. The pre-trained model weights, associated code, and complete dataset are available at https://bigearth.net.</p></details> |  | None |

However, ongoing deforestation and degradation pose a significant threat to their existence, necessitating effective monitoring and the proposal of actions to mitigate the damage caused by these processes. In this regard, initiatives range from government and private sector monitoring programs to solutions based on citizen science campaigns, for example. Particularly in the context of citizen science campaigns, the segmentation of remote sensing images to identify deforested areas and subsequently submit them to analysis by non-specialized volunteers is necessary. Thus, segmentation using superpixel-based techniques proves to be a viable solution for this important task. Therefore, this paper presents an analysis of 22 superpixel-based segmentation methods applied to remote sensing images, aiming to identify which of them are more suitable for generating segments for citizen science campaigns. The results reveal that seven of the segmentation methods outperformed the baseline method (SLIC) currently employed in the ForestEyes citizen science project, indicating an opportunity for improvement in this important stage of campaign development.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements in generative models have made the generation of realistic images increasingly accessible, offering new opportunities for this task. Given the conceptual alignment between image generation and cloud removal tasks, generative models present a promising approach for addressing cloud removal in remote sensing.

Due to the complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further propose using a patch-wise discriminator to determine whether each patch of the image is real or not. The proposed reconstructive transfer learning approach demonstrates significant improvements in cloud removal performance compared to other GAN-based methods. Additionally, whilst direct comparisons with some of the state-of-the-art cloud removal techniques are limited due to unclear details regarding their train/test data splits, the proposed model achieves competitive results based on available benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

VHM is built on a large-scale remote sensing image-text dataset with rich-content captions (VersaD), and an honest instruction dataset comprising both factual and deceptive questions (HnstD). Unlike prevailing remote sensing image-text datasets, in which image captions focus on a few prominent objects and their relationships, VersaD captions provide detailed information about image properties, object attributes, and the overall scene. This comprehensive captioning enables VHM to thoroughly understand remote sensing images and perform diverse remote sensing tasks. Moreover, different from existing remote sensing instruction datasets that only include factual questions, HnstD contains additional deceptive questions stemming from the non-existence of objects. This feature prevents VHM from producing affirmative answers to nonsense queries, thereby ensuring its honesty. In our experiments, VHM significantly outperforms various vision language models on common tasks of scene classification, visual question answering, and visual grounding. Additionally, VHM achieves competent performance on several unexplored tasks, such as building vectorizing, multi-label classification and honest question answering.

These models can then be fine-tuned with small amounts of labeled training and applied to a variety of applications. Most existing foundation models are designed for high spatial resolution, cloud-free satellite imagery or photos, limiting their applicability in scenarios that require frequent temporal monitoring or broad spectral profiles. As a result, foundation models trained solely on cloud-free images have limited utility for applications that involve atmospheric variables or require atmospheric corrections. We introduce SatVision-TOA, a novel foundation model pre-trained on 14-band MODIS L1B Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiance imagery, addressing the need for models pre-trained to handle moderate- and coarse-resolution all-sky remote sensing data. The SatVision-TOA model is pre-trained using a Masked-Image-Modeling (MIM) framework and the SwinV2 architecture, and learns detailed contextual representations through self-supervised learning without the need for labels. It is a 3 billion parameter model that is trained on 100 million images. To our knowledge this is the largest foundation model trained solely on satellite RS imagery. Results show that SatVision-TOA achieves superior performance over baseline methods on downstream tasks such as 3D cloud retrieval. Notably, the model achieves a mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 0.46, a substantial improvement over the baseline mIOU of 0.22. Additionally, the rate of false negative results in the fine-tuning task were reduced by over 50% compared to the baseline. Our work advances pre-trained vision modeling for multispectral RS by learning from a variety of atmospheric and aerosol conditions to improve cloud and land surface monitoring.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures | None |

Although impressive achievements have been witnessed with the two types of technologies, the occlusive information flow between the two domains is a bottleneck hindering their ulterior progression. Herein, we propose a novel framework that integrates communication and computational imaging (ICCI) to break through the inherent isolation between communication and computational imaging for remote perception. By jointly considering the sensing and transmitting of remote visual information, the ICCI framework performs a full-link information transfer optimization, aiming to minimize information loss from the generation of the information source to the execution of the final vision tasks. We conduct numerical analysis and experiments to demonstrate the ICCI framework by integrating communication systems and snapshot compressive imaging systems. Compared with straightforward combination schemes, which sequentially execute sensing and transmitting, the ICCI scheme shows greater robustness against channel noise and impairments while achieving higher data compression. Moreover, an 80 km 27-band hyperspectral video perception with a rate of 30 fps is experimentally achieved. This new ICCI remote perception paradigm offers a highefficiency solution for various real-time computer vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Although segmentation algorithms based on CNNs and Transformers achieve significant progress in performance, balancing segmentation accuracy and computational complexity remains challenging, limiting their wide application in practical tasks. To address this, this paper introduces state space model (SSM) and proposes a novel hybrid semantic segmentation network based on vision Mamba (CVMH-UNet). This method designs a cross-scanning visual state space block (CVSSBlock) that uses cross 2D scanning (CS2D) to fully capture global information from multiple directions, while by incorporating convolutional neural network branches to overcome the constraints of Vision Mamba (VMamba) in acquiring local information, this approach facilitates a comprehensive analysis of both global and local features. Furthermore, to address the issue of limited discriminative power and the difficulty in achieving detailed fusion with direct skip connections, a multi-frequency multi-scale feature fusion block (MFMSBlock) is designed. This module introduces multi-frequency information through 2D discrete cosine transform (2D DCT) to enhance information utilization and provides additional scale local detail information through point-wise convolution branches. Finally, it aggregates multi-scale information along the channel dimension, achieving refined feature fusion.

Typical approaches to addressing this challenge aggregate information to a common coarse resolution, i.e., compatible resolutions, prior to modeling. Such pre-processing aggregation simplifies analysis, but potentially causes information loss and hence compromised inference and predictive performance. To avoid losing potential information provided by finer spatial resolution data and improve predictive performance, we propose a new Bayesian method that constructs a latent spatial process model at the finest spatial resolution. This model is tailored to settings where the outcome variable is measured on a coarser spatial resolution than predictor variables -- a configuration seen increasingly when high spatial resolution remotely sensed predictors are used in analysis. A key contribution of this work is an efficient algorithm that enables full Bayesian inference using finer resolution data while optimizing computational and storage costs. The proposed method is applied to a forest damage assessment for the 2018 Adrian storm in Carinthia, Austria, that uses high-resolution laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements and relatively coarse resolution forest inventory measurements. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the proposed approach substantially improves inference for small prediction units.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures | None |

Such datasets provide real-time social and environmental context to inferred biological traits, which can enable new, data-driven conservation and ecosystem management. The development of machine learning techniques to extract biological traits from images are impeded by the volume and quality data required to train these models. Autonomous, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are well suited to collect in situ imageomics data as they can traverse remote terrain quickly to collect large volumes of data with greater consistency and reliability compared to manually piloted UAV missions. However, little guidance exists on optimizing autonomous UAV missions for the purposes of remote sensing for conservation and biodiversity monitoring. The UAV video dataset curated by KABR: In-Situ Dataset for Kenyan Animal Behavior Recognition from Drone Videos required three weeks to collect, a time-consuming and expensive endeavor. Our analysis of KABR revealed that a third of the videos gathered were unusable for the purposes of inferring wildlife behavior. We analyzed the flight telemetry data from portions of UAV videos that were usable for inferring wildlife behavior, and demonstrate how these insights can be integrated into an autonomous remote sensing system to track wildlife in real time. Our autonomous remote sensing system optimizes the UAV's actions to increase the yield of usable data, and matches the flight path of an expert pilot with an 87% accuracy rate, representing an 18.2% improvement in accuracy over previously proposed methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, the attention mechanism has been widely used in change detection tasks. However, existing attention mechanisms often employ down-sampling operations such as average pooling on the Key and Value components to enhance computational efficiency. These irreversible operations result in the loss of high-frequency components and other important information. To address this limitation, we develop Wavelet-based Bi-dimensional Aggregation Network (WBANet) for SAR image change detection. We design a wavelet-based self-attention block that includes discrete wavelet transform and inverse discrete wavelet transform operations on Key and Value components. Hence, the feature undergoes downsampling without any loss of information, while simultaneously enhancing local contextual awareness through an expanded receptive field. Additionally, we have incorporated a bi-dimensional aggregation module that boosts the non-linear representation capability by merging spatial and channel information via broadcast mechanism. Experimental results on three SAR datasets demonstrate that our WBANet significantly outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our WBANet achieves 98.33\%, 96.65\%, and 96.62\% of percentage of correct classification (PCC) on the respective datasets, highlighting its superior performance.

An objective function based on weight is proposed to achieve the purpose of fast image recognition. The algorithm divides the pixels of the image into multiple subdomains and uses a quadtree to access the image. A technique for threshold optimization utilizing a simplex algorithm is presented. Aiming at the nonlinear characteristics of hyperspectral images, a generalized discriminant analysis algorithm based on kernel function is proposed. In this project, a hyperspectral remote sensing image is taken as the object, and we investigate its mathematical modeling, solution methods, and feature extraction techniques. It is found that different types of objects are independent of each other and compact in image processing. Compared with the traditional linear discrimination method, the result of image segmentation is better. This method can not only overcome the disadvantage of the traditional method which is easy to be affected by light, but also extract the features of the object quickly and accurately. It has important reference significance for clinical diagnosis.</p></details> | conference | None |

However, millions of people live in slums or informal settlements with poor living conditions in many major cities around the world, especially in less developed countries. To emancipate these settlements and their inhabitants through government intervention, accurate data about slum location and extent is required. While ground survey data is the most reliable, such surveys are costly and time-consuming. An alternative is remotely sensed data obtained from very high-resolution (VHR) imagery. With the advancement of new technology, remote sensing based mapping of slums has emerged as a prominent research area. The parallel rise of Artificial Intelligence, especially Deep Learning has added a new dimension to this field as it allows automated analysis of satellite imagery to identify complex spatial patterns associated with slums. This article offers a detailed review and meta-analysis of research on slum mapping using remote sensing imagery from 2014 to 2024, with a special focus on deep learning approaches. Our analysis reveals a trend towards increasingly complex neural network architectures, with advancements in data preprocessing and model training techniques significantly enhancing slum identification accuracy. We have attempted to identify key methodologies that are effective across diverse geographic contexts. While acknowledging the transformative impact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in slum detection, our review underscores the absence of a universally optimal model, suggesting the need for context-specific adaptations. We also identify prevailing challenges in this field, such as data limitations and a lack of model explainability and suggest potential strategies for overcoming these.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper addresses this problem with a proposal of unsupervised flat-wide learning approach (UNISA) for unsupervised few-shot continual learning approaches of remote sensing image scene classifications which do not depend on any labelled samples for its model updates. UNISA is developed from the idea of prototype scattering and positive sampling for learning representations while the catastrophic forgetting problem is tackled with the flat-wide learning approach combined with a ball generator to address the data scarcity problem. Our numerical study with remote sensing image scene datasets and a hyperspectral dataset confirms the advantages of our solution.

This model has witnessed numerous applications in several fields, including control theory, signal processing, economics and machine learning. In the field of deep learning, state space models are used to process sequence data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and video understanding. By mapping sequence data to state space, long-term dependencies in the data can be better captured. In particular, modern SSMs have shown strong representational capabilities in NLP, especially in long sequence modeling, while maintaining linear time complexity. Notably, based on the latest state-space models, Mamba merges time-varying parameters into SSMs and formulates a hardware-aware algorithm for efficient training and inference. Given its impressive efficiency and strong long-range dependency modeling capability, Mamba is expected to become a new AI architecture that may outperform Transformer. Recently, a number of works have attempted to study the potential of Mamba in various fields, such as general vision, multi-modal, medical image analysis and remote sensing image analysis, by extending Mamba from natural language domain to visual domain. To fully understand Mamba in the visual domain, we conduct a comprehensive survey and present a taxonomy study. This survey focuses on Mamba's application to a variety of visual tasks and data types, and discusses its predecessors, recent advances and far-reaching impact on a wide range of domains.

However, most existing deep learning-based change detection methods mainly focus on intricate feature extraction and multi-scale feature fusion, while ignoring the insufficient utilization of features in the intermediate stages, thus resulting in sub-optimal results. To this end, we propose a novel framework, named RFL-CDNet, that utilizes richer feature learning to boost change detection performance. Specifically, we first introduce deep multiple supervision to enhance intermediate representations, thus unleashing the potential of backbone feature extractor at each stage. Furthermore, we design the Coarse-To-Fine Guiding (C2FG) module and the Learnable Fusion (LF) module to further improve feature learning and obtain more discriminative feature representations. The C2FG module aims to seamlessly integrate the side prediction from the previous coarse-scale into the current fine-scale prediction in a coarse-to-fine manner, while LF module assumes that the contribution of each stage and each spatial location is independent, thus designing a learnable module to fuse multiple predictions. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our proposed RFL-CDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on WHU cultivated land dataset and CDD dataset, and the second-best performance on WHU building dataset.

Existing methods require training models separately for each dataset, which leads to poor domain generalization. Moreover, these methods rely heavily on large amounts of high-quality pair-labelled data for training, which is expensive and impractical. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning (ChangeCLIP) based on visual-language pre-training for change detection domain generalization. Additionally, we propose a dynamic context optimization for prompt learning. Meanwhile, to address the data dependency issue of existing methods, we introduce a single-temporal and controllable AI-generated training strategy (SAIN). This allows us to train the model using a large number of single-temporal images without image pairs in the real world, achieving excellent generalization. Extensive experiments on series of real change detection datasets validate the superiority and strong generalization of ChangeCLIP, outperforming state-of-the-art change detection methods.

However, current methodologies often treat these two tasks as separate entities, thereby failing to leverage shared knowledge. Moreover, the complexity and diversity of remote sensing image scenes pose additional challenges, as most algorithms are designed to model individual small datasets, thus lacking cross-scene generalization. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive remote sensing image building understanding model, termed RSBuilding, developed from the perspective of the foundation model. RSBuilding is designed to enhance cross-scene generalization and task universality. Specifically, we extract image features based on the prior knowledge of the foundation model and devise a multi-level feature sampler to augment scale information. To unify task representation and integrate image spatiotemporal clues, we introduce a cross-attention decoder with task prompts. Addressing the current shortage of datasets that incorporate annotations for both tasks, we have developed a federated training strategy to facilitate smooth model convergence even when supervision for some tasks is missing, thereby bolstering the complementarity of different tasks. Our model was trained on a dataset comprising up to 245,000 images and validated on multiple building extraction and change detection datasets. The experimental results substantiate that RSBuilding can concurrently handle two structurally distinct tasks and exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Significant progress has been made in this field in recent years, largely due to the advancement of deep learning techniques. However, existing deep-learning-based CD methods encounter challenges in effectively integrating neighborhood and scale information, resulting in suboptimal performance. Therefore, by exploring the influence patterns of neighborhood and scale information, this paper proposes an Integrated Neighborhood and Scale Information Network (INSINet) for open-pit mine CD in HR remote sensing images. Specifically, INSINet introduces 8-neighborhood-image information to acquire a larger receptive field, improving the recognition of center image boundary regions. Drawing on techniques of skip connection, deep supervision, and attention mechanism, the multi-path deep supervised attention (MDSA) module is designed to enhance multi-scale information fusion and change feature extraction. Experimental analysis reveals that incorporating neighborhood and scale information enhances the F1 score of INSINet by 6.40%, with improvements of 3.08% and 3.32% respectively. INSINet outperforms existing methods with an Overall Accuracy of 97.69%, Intersection over Union of 71.26%, and F1 score of 83.22%.

Although remote sensing technology has advanced rapidly, leading to a proliferation of satellite imagery, the inherent complexity of these images often makes them difficult for non-expert users to understand. Natural language, as a carrier of human knowledge, can be a bridge between common users and complicated satellite imagery. In this context, we introduce a global-scale, high-quality image-text dataset for remote sensing, providing natural language descriptions for Sentinel-2 data to facilitate the understanding of satellite imagery for common users. Specifically, we utilize Sentinel-2 data for its global coverage as the foundational image source, employing semantic segmentation labels from the European Space Agency's (ESA) WorldCover project to enrich the descriptions of land covers. By conducting in-depth semantic analysis, we formulate detailed prompts to elicit rich descriptions from ChatGPT. To enhance the dataset's quality, we introduce the manual verification process. This step involves manual inspection and correction to refine the dataset, thus significantly improving its accuracy and quality. Finally, we offer the community ChatEarthNet, a large-scale image-text dataset characterized by global coverage, high quality, wide-ranging diversity, and detailed descriptions. ChatEarthNet consists of 163,488 image-text pairs with captions generated by ChatGPT-3.5 and an additional 10,000 image-text pairs with captions generated by ChatGPT-4V(ision).

This research addresses this problem with a novel, scalable, and AI-driven solution. The primary hurdle in combat identification in remote sensing imagery is the accurate recognition of Novel/Unknown types of aircraft in addition to Known types. Traditional methods, human expert-driven combat identification and image classification, fall short in identifying Novel classes. Our methodology employs similarity learning to discern features of a broad spectrum of military and civilian aircraft. It discerns both Known and Novel aircraft types, leveraging metric learning for the identification and supervised few-shot learning for aircraft type classification. To counter the challenge of limited low-resolution remote sensing data, we propose an end-to-end framework that adapts to the diverse and versatile process of military aircraft recognition by training a generalized embedder in fully supervised manner. Comparative analysis with earlier aircraft image classification methods shows that our approach is effective for aircraft image classification (F1-score Aircraft Type of 0.861) and pioneering for quantifying the identification of Novel types (F1-score Bipartitioning of 0.936). The proposed methodology effectively addresses inherent challenges in remote sensing data, thereby setting new standards in dataset quality. The research opens new avenues for domain experts and demonstrates unique capabilities in distinguishing various aircraft types, contributing to a more robust, domain-adapted potential for real-time aircraft recognition.</p></details> |  | None |

However, there are several important issues that limit the application of current spatiotemporal fusion methods. First, most spatiotemporal fusion methods are based on pixel-level computation, which neglects the valuable object-level information of the land surface. Moreover, many existing methods cannot accurately retrieve strong temporal changes between the available high-resolution image at base date and the predicted one. This study proposes an Object-Based Spatial Unmixing Model (OBSUM), which incorporates object-based image analysis and spatial unmixing, to overcome the two abovementioned problems. OBSUM consists of one preprocessing step and three fusion steps, i.e., object-level unmixing, object-level residual compensation, and pixel-level residual compensation. OBSUM can be applied using only one fine image at the base date and one coarse image at the prediction date, without the need of a coarse image at the base date. The performance of OBSUM was compared with five representative spatiotemporal fusion methods. The experimental results demonstrated that OBSUM outperformed other methods in terms of both accuracy indices and visual effects over time-series. Furthermore, OBSUM also achieved satisfactory results in two typical remote sensing applications. Therefore, it has great potential to generate accurate and high-resolution time-series observations for supporting various remote sensing applications.</p></details> |  | None |

In connection to remote sensing imagery, these tasks can help non-expert users in extracting relevant Earth observation information for a variety of applications. Still, despite some previous efforts, the development and application of vision and language models to the remote sensing domain have been hindered by the relatively small size of the available datasets and models used in previous studies. In this work, we propose RS-CapRet, a Vision and Language method for remote sensing tasks, in particular image captioning and text-image retrieval. We specifically propose to use a highly capable large decoder language model together with image encoders adapted to remote sensing imagery through contrastive language-image pre-training. To bridge together the image encoder and language decoder, we propose training simple linear layers with examples from combining different remote sensing image captioning datasets, keeping the other parameters frozen. RS-CapRet can then generate descriptions for remote sensing images and retrieve images from textual descriptions, achieving SOTA or competitive performance with existing methods. Qualitative results illustrate that RS-CapRet can effectively leverage the pre-trained large language model to describe remote sensing images, retrieve them based on different types of queries, and also show the ability to process interleaved sequences of images and text in a dialogue manner.</p></details> |  | None |

Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising approach for remote sensing image classification due to its ability to exploit large amounts of unlabeled data. Unlike traditional supervised learning, SSL aims to learn representations of data without the need for explicit labels. This is achieved by formulating auxiliary tasks that can be used for pre-training models before fine-tuning them on a given downstream task. A common approach in practice to SSL pre-training is utilizing standard pre-training datasets, such as ImageNet. While relevant, such a general approach can have a sub-optimal influence on the downstream performance of models, especially on tasks from challenging domains such as remote sensing. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of SSL pre-training by employing the iBOT framework coupled with Vision transformers trained on Million-AID, a large and unlabeled remote sensing dataset. We present a comprehensive study of different self-supervised pre-training strategies and evaluate their effect across 14 downstream datasets with diverse properties. Our results demonstrate that leveraging large in-domain datasets for self-supervised pre-training consistently leads to improved predictive downstream performance, compared to the standard approaches found in practice.</p></details> |  | None |

The main idea of RefSR is to utilize additional information from the reference (Ref) image to recover the high-frequency components in low-resolution (LR) images. By transferring relevant textures through feature matching, RefSR models outperform existing single image super-resolution (SISR) models. However, their performance significantly declines when a domain gap between Ref and LR images exists, which often occurs in real-world scenarios, such as satellite imaging. In this letter, we introduce a Domain Matching (DM) module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing RefSR models to enhance their performance in a plug-and-play manner. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore Domain Matching-based RefSR in remote sensing image processing. Our analysis reveals that their domain gaps often occur in different satellites, and our model effectively addresses these challenges, whereas existing models struggle.

Remote sensing data usually consists of multiple bands of spectral images in which there exist semantically meaningful land cover subregions, co-registered with other source data such as LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) data, where available. This suggests that, in order to account for spatial correlation between pixels, a feature vector associated with each pixel may be a vectorized tensor representing the multiple bands and a local patch as appropriate. Similarly, multiple types of texture features based on a pixel's local patch would also be beneficial for encoding locally statistical information and spatial variations, without necessarily labelling pixel-wise a large amount of ground truth, then training a supervised model, which is sometimes impractical. In this work, by resorting to label only a small quantity of pixels, a new semi-supervised segmentation approach is proposed. Initially, over all pixels, an image data matrix is created in high dimensional feature space. Then, t-SNE projects the high dimensional data onto 3D embedding. By using radial basis functions as input features, which use the labelled data samples as centres, to pair with the output class labels, a modified canonical correlation analysis algorithm, referred to as RBF-CCA, is introduced which learns the associated projection matrix via the small labelled data set. The associated canonical variables, obtained for the full image, are applied by k-means clustering algorithm. The proposed semi-supervised RBF-CCA algorithm has been implemented on several remotely sensed multispectral images, demonstrating excellent segmentation results.</p></details> |  | None |

However, how to effectively extract and fuse the deep features of bi-temporal images for improving the accuracy of CD is still a challenge. To address that, a novel adjacent-level feature fusion network with 3D convolution (named AFCF3D-Net) is proposed in this article. First, through the inner fusion property of 3D convolution, we design a new feature fusion way that can simultaneously extract and fuse the feature information from bi-temporal images. Then, to alleviate the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level features, we propose an adjacent-level feature cross-fusion (AFCF) module to aggregate complementary feature information between the adjacent levels. Furthermore, the full-scale skip connection strategy is introduced to improve the capability of pixel-wise prediction and the compactness of changed objects in the results. Finally, the proposed AFCF3D-Net has been validated on the three challenging remote sensing CD datasets: the Wuhan building dataset (WHU-CD), the LEVIR building dataset (LEVIR-CD), and the Sun Yat-Sen University dataset (SYSU-CD). The results of quantitative analysis and qualitative comparison demonstrate that the proposed AFCF3D-Net achieves better performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

It greatly facilitates downstream applications such as pan-sharpening, change detection, land-cover classification, etc. Yet, image fusion solutions are highly disparate to various remote sensing problems and thus are often narrowly defined in existing reviews as topical applications, such as pan-sharpening, and spatial-temporal image fusion. Considering that image fusion can be theoretically applied to any gridded data through pixel-level operations, in this paper, we expanded its scope by comprehensively surveying relevant works with a simple taxonomy: 1) many-to-one image fusion; 2) many-to-many image fusion. This simple taxonomy defines image fusion as a mapping problem that turns either a single or a set of images into another single or set of images, depending on the desired coherence, e.g., spectral, spatial/resolution coherence, etc. We show that this simple taxonomy, despite the significant modality difference it covers, can be presented by a conceptually easy framework. In addition, we provide a meta-analysis to review the major papers studying the various types of image fusion and their applications over the years (from the 1980s to date), covering 5,926 peer-reviewed papers. Finally, we discuss the main benefits and emerging challenges to provide open research directions and potential future works.</p></details> | 21pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Free Lunch for Federated Remote Sensing Target Fine-Grained Classification: A Parameter-Efficient Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01493v1)** | 2024-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing Target Fine-grained Classification (TFGC) is of great significance in both military and civilian fields. Due to location differences, growth in data size, and centralized server storage constraints, these data are usually stored under different databases across regions/countries. However, privacy laws and national security concerns constrain researchers from accessing these sensitive remote sensing images for further analysis. Additionally, low-resource remote sensing devices encounter challenges in terms of communication overhead and efficiency when dealing with the ever-increasing data and model scales. To solve the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel Privacy-Reserving TFGC Framework based on Federated Learning, dubbed PRFL. The proposed framework allows each client to learn global and local knowledge to enhance the local representation of private data in environments with extreme statistical heterogeneity (non. Independent and Identically Distributed, IID). Thus, it provides highly customized models to clients with differentiated data distributions. Moreover, the framework minimizes communication overhead and improves efficiency while ensuring satisfactory performance, thereby enhancing robustness and practical applicability under resource-scarce conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PRFL on the classical TFGC task by leveraging four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review, 23 pages, 3 figures, 12 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Superpixel-based and Spatially-regularized Diffusion Learning for Unsupervised Hyperspectral Image Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15447v1)** | 2023-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images (HSIs) provide exceptional spatial and spectral resolution of a scene, crucial for various remote sensing applications. However, the high dimensionality, presence of noise and outliers, and the need for precise labels of HSIs present significant challenges to HSIs analysis, motivating the development of performant HSI clustering algorithms. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised HSI clustering algorithm, Superpixel-based and Spatially-regularized Diffusion Learning (S2DL), which addresses these challenges by incorporating rich spatial information encoded in HSIs into diffusion geometry-based clustering. S2DL employs the Entropy Rate Superpixel (ERS) segmentation technique to partition an image into superpixels, then constructs a spatially-regularized diffusion graph using the most representative high-density pixels. This approach reduces computational burden while preserving accuracy. Cluster modes, serving as exemplars for underlying cluster structure, are identified as the highest-density pixels farthest in diffusion distance from other highest-density pixels. These modes guide the labeling of the remaining representative pixels from ERS superpixels. Finally, majority voting is applied to the labels assigned within each superpixel to propagate labels to the rest of the image. This spatial-spectral approach simultaneously simplifies graph construction, reduces computational cost, and improves clustering performance. S2DL's performance is illustrated with extensive experiments on three publicly available, real-world HSIs: Indian Pines, Salinas, and Salinas A. Additionally, we apply S2DL to landscape-scale, unsupervised mangrove species mapping in the Mai Po Nature Reserve, Hong Kong, using a Gaofen-5 HSI. The success of S2DL in these diverse numerical experiments indicates its efficacy on a wide range of important unsupervised remote sensing analysis tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 9 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> | None |

However, while image datasets for object detection have grown and continue to proliferate (the current most extensive public set, ImageNet, contains over 14m images with over 14m instances), the same cannot be said for textual caption datasets. While they have certainly been growing in recent years, caption datasets present a much more difficult challenge due to language differences, grammar, and the time it takes for humans to generate them. Current datasets have certainly provided many instances to work with, but it becomes problematic when a captioner may have a more limited vocabulary, one may not be adequately fluent in the language, or there are simple grammatical mistakes. These difficulties are increased when the images get more specific, such as remote sensing images. This paper aims to address this issue of potential information and communication shortcomings in caption datasets. To provide a more precise analysis, we specify our domain of images to be remote sensing images in the RSICD dataset and experiment with the captions provided here. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT grammar correction is a simple and effective way to increase the performance accuracy of caption models by making data captions more diverse and grammatically correct.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

| **[The curse of language biases in remote sensing VQA: the role of spatial attributes, language diversity, and the need for clear evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16782v1)** | 2023-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing visual question answering (RSVQA) opens new opportunities for the use of overhead imagery by the general public, by enabling human-machine interaction with natural language. Building on the recent advances in natural language processing and computer vision, the goal of RSVQA is to answer a question formulated in natural language about a remote sensing image. Language understanding is essential to the success of the task, but has not yet been thoroughly examined in RSVQA. In particular, the problem of language biases is often overlooked in the remote sensing community, which can impact model robustness and lead to wrong conclusions about the performances of the model. Thus, the present work aims at highlighting the problem of language biases in RSVQA with a threefold analysis strategy: visual blind models, adversarial testing and dataset analysis. This analysis focuses both on model and data. Moreover, we motivate the use of more informative and complementary evaluation metrics sensitive to the issue. The gravity of language biases in RSVQA is then exposed for all of these methods with the training of models discarding the image data and the manipulation of the visual input during inference. Finally, a detailed analysis of question-answer distribution demonstrates the root of the problem in the data itself. Thanks to this analytical study, we observed that biases in remote sensing are more severe than in standard VQA, likely due to the specifics of existing remote sensing datasets for the task, e.g. geographical similarities and sparsity, as well as a simpler vocabulary and question generation strategies. While new, improved and less-biased datasets appear as a necessity for the development of the promising field of RSVQA, we demonstrate that more informed, relative evaluation metrics remain much needed to transparently communicate results of future RSVQA methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The significance of XAI spans various domains, from healthcare to finance, where understanding the decision-making process of deep learning algorithms is essential. Most AI-based computer vision models are often black boxes; hence, providing explainability of deep neural networks in image processing is crucial for their wide adoption and deployment in medical image analysis, autonomous driving, and remote sensing applications. Recently, several XAI methods for image classification tasks have been introduced. On the contrary, image segmentation has received comparatively less attention in the context of explainability, although it is a fundamental task in computer vision applications, especially in remote sensing. Only some research proposes gradient-based XAI algorithms for image segmentation. This paper adapts the recent gradient-free Sobol XAI method for semantic segmentation. To measure the performance of the Sobol method for segmentation, we propose a quantitative XAI evaluation method based on a learnable noise model. The main objective of this model is to induce noise on the explanation maps, where higher induced noise signifies low accuracy and vice versa. A benchmark analysis is conducted to evaluate and compare performance of three XAI methods, including Seg-Grad-CAM, Seg-Grad-CAM++ and Seg-Sobol using the proposed noise-based evaluation technique. This constitutes the first attempt to run and evaluate XAI methods using high-resolution satellite images.</p></details> |  | None |

These pansharpened images enhance precision in land cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring within remote sensing data analysis. While deep learning techniques have shown significant success in pansharpening, existing methods often face limitations in their evaluation, focusing on restricted satellite data sources, single scene types, and low-resolution images. This paper addresses this gap by introducing PanBench, a high-resolution multi-scene dataset containing all mainstream satellites and comprising 5,898 pairs of samples. Each pair includes a four-channel (RGB + near-infrared) multispectral image of 256x256 pixels and a mono-channel panchromatic image of 1,024x1,024 pixels. To achieve high-fidelity synthesis, we propose a Cascaded Multiscale Fusion Network (CMFNet) for Pansharpening. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CMFNet. We have released the dataset, source code, and pre-trained models in the supplementary, fostering further research in remote sensing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

Most existing remote sensing data-based models are based on supervised learning that requires large and representative human-labelled data for model training, which is costly and time-consuming. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) enables the models to learn a representation from orders of magnitude more unlabelled data. This representation has been proven to boost the performance of downstream tasks and has potential for remote sensing applications. The success of SSL is heavily dependent on a pre-designed pretext task, which introduces an inductive bias into the model from a large amount of unlabelled data. Since remote sensing imagery has rich spectral information beyond the standard RGB colour space, the pretext tasks established in computer vision based on RGB images may not be straightforward to be extended to the multi/hyperspectral domain. To address this challenge, this work has designed a novel SSL framework that is capable of learning representation from both spectra-spatial information of unlabelled data. The framework contains two novel pretext tasks for object-based and pixel-based remote sensing data analysis methods, respectively. Through two typical downstream tasks evaluation (a multi-label land cover classification task on Sentienl-2 multispectral datasets and a ground soil parameter retrieval task on hyperspectral datasets), the results demonstrate that the representation obtained through the proposed SSL achieved a significant improvement in model performance.</p></details> |  | None |

This study aims to advance the application of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), an innovative image segmentation model by Meta AI, in the field of remote sensing image analysis. SAM is known for its exceptional generalization capabilities and zero-shot learning, making it a promising approach to processing aerial and orbital images from diverse geographical contexts. Our exploration involved testing SAM across multi-scale datasets using various input prompts, such as bounding boxes, individual points, and text descriptors. To enhance the model's performance, we implemented a novel automated technique that combines a text-prompt-derived general example with one-shot training. This adjustment resulted in an improvement in accuracy, underscoring SAM's potential for deployment in remote sensing imagery and reducing the need for manual annotation. Despite the limitations encountered with lower spatial resolution images, SAM exhibits promising adaptability to remote sensing data analysis. We recommend future research to enhance the model's proficiency through integration with supplementary fine-tuning techniques and other networks. Furthermore, we provide the open-source code of our modifications on online repositories, encouraging further and broader adaptations of SAM to the remote sensing domain.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures | None |

The ability to accurately describe changes occurring in multi-temporal remote sensing images is becoming increasingly important for geospatial understanding and land planning. Unlike natural image change captioning tasks, remote sensing change captioning aims to capture the most significant changes, irrespective of various influential factors such as illumination, seasonal effects, and complex land covers. In this study, we highlight the significance of accurately describing changes in remote sensing images and present a comparison of the change captioning task for natural and synthetic images and remote sensing images. To address the challenge of generating accurate captions, we propose an attentive changes-to-captions network, called Chg2Cap for short, for bi-temporal remote sensing images. The network comprises three main components: 1) a Siamese CNN-based feature extractor to collect high-level representations for each image pair; 2) an attentive decoder that includes a hierarchical self-attention block to locate change-related features and a residual block to generate the image embedding; and 3) a transformer-based caption generator to decode the relationship between the image embedding and the word embedding into a description. The proposed Chg2Cap network is evaluated on two representative remote sensing datasets, and a comprehensive experimental analysis is provided.

This approach used to be carried out through pixel-based or object-oriented methods. However, due to the massive amount of remote sensing data, variations in different earthquake scenarios, and the efficiency requirement for post-earthquake rescue, these methods are difficult to develop into an accurate, rapid, comprehensive, and general (cross-scene) solution for co-seismic landslide recognition. This paper develops a robust model, Dense Feature Pyramid with Encoder-decoder Network (DFPENet), to understand and fuse the multi-scale features of objects in remote sensing images. The proposed method achieves a competitive segmentation accuracy on the public ISPRS 2D Semantic. Furthermore, a comprehensive and widely-used scheme is proposed for co-seismic landslide recognition, which integrates image features extracted from the DFPENet model, geologic features, temporal resolution, landslide spatial analysis, and transfer learning, while only RGB images are used. To corroborate its feasibility and applicability, the proposed scheme is applied to two earthquake-triggered landslides in Jiuzhaigou (China) and Hokkaido (Japan), using available pre- and post-earthquake remote sensing images.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 figures | None |

The multispectral imagery captured by sensors onboard these satellites is critical for a wide range of scientific fields. Despite the increasing popularity of deep learning and remote sensing, the majority of researchers still use decision trees and random forests for Landsat image analysis due to the prevalence of small labeled datasets and lack of foundation models.

Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory to the level of each individual tree have generated a variety of methods for Individual Tree Crown Detection and Delineation (ITCD). This review covers ITCD methods for detecting and delineating individual tree crowns, and systematically reviews the past and present of ITCD-related researches applied to the optical remote sensing images. With the goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing ITCD efforts, we conduct a comprehensive review of recent ITCD papers to build a meta-data analysis, including the algorithm, the study site, the tree species, the sensor type, the evaluation method, etc. We categorize the reviewed methods into three classes: (1) traditional image processing methods (such as local maximum filtering, image segmentation, etc.); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest, decision tree, etc.); and (3) deep learning based methods. With the deep learning-oriented approaches contributing a majority of the papers, we further discuss the deep learning-based methods as semantic segmentation and object detection methods. In addition, we discuss four ITCD-related issues to further comprehend the ITCD domain using optical remote sensing data, such as comparisons between multi-sensor based data and optical data in ITCD domain, comparisons among different algorithms and different ITCD tasks, etc. Finally, this review proposes some ITCD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and potential hot topics in future ITCD research.</p></details> |  | None |

Currently, LLMs are unable to extract or comprehend information from images and may generate inaccurate text due to a lack of domain knowledge, limiting their use in forestry data analysis. To address this issue, we propose a modular LLM expert system, Tree-GPT, that integrates image understanding modules, domain knowledge bases, and toolchains. This empowers LLMs with the ability to comprehend images, acquire accurate knowledge, generate code, and perform data analysis in a local environment. Specifically, the image understanding module extracts structured information from forest remote sensing images by utilizing automatic or interactive generation of prompts to guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in generating and selecting optimal tree segmentation results. The system then calculates tree structural parameters based on these results and stores them in a database. Upon receiving a specific natural language instruction, the LLM generates code based on a thought chain to accomplish the analysis task. The code is then executed by an LLM agent in a local environment and . For ecological parameter calculations, the system retrieves the corresponding knowledge from the knowledge base and inputs it into the LLM to guide the generation of accurate code. We tested this system on several tasks, including Search, Visualization, and Machine Learning Analysis. The prototype system performed well, demonstrating the potential for dynamic usage of LLMs in forestry research and environmental sciences.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning has shown promising results in CD tasks, it requires a large number of labeled and paired multi-temporal images to achieve high performance. Pairing and annotating large-scale multi-temporal remote sensing images is both expensive and time-consuming. To make deep learning-based CD techniques more practical and cost-effective, we propose an unsupervised single-temporal CD framework based on intra- and inter-image patch exchange (I3PE). The I3PE framework allows for training deep change detectors on unpaired and unlabeled single-temporal remote sensing images that are readily available in real-world applications. The I3PE framework comprises four steps: 1) intra-image patch exchange method is based on an object-based image analysis method and adaptive clustering algorithm, which generates pseudo-bi-temporal image pairs and corresponding change labels from single-temporal images by exchanging patches within the image; 2) inter-image patch exchange method can generate more types of land-cover changes by exchanging patches between images; 3) a simulation pipeline consisting of several image enhancement methods is proposed to simulate the radiometric difference between pre- and post-event images caused by different imaging conditions in real situations; 4) self-supervised learning based on pseudo-labels is applied to further improve the performance of the change detectors in both unsupervised and semi-supervised cases. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that I3PE outperforms representative unsupervised approaches and achieves F1 value improvements of 10.65% and 6.99% to the SOTA method.

However, collecting, preprocessing, and annotating multi-temporal remote sensing images at scale is non-trivial since it is expensive and knowledge-intensive. In this paper, we present a scalable multi-temporal remote sensing change data generator via generative modeling, which is cheap and automatic, alleviating these problems. Our main idea is to simulate a stochastic change process over time. We consider the stochastic change process as a probabilistic semantic state transition, namely generative probabilistic change model (GPCM), which decouples the complex simulation problem into two more trackable sub-problems, \ie, change event simulation and semantic change synthesis. To solve these two problems, we present the change generator (Changen), a GAN-based GPCM, enabling controllable object change data generation, including customizable object property, and change event. The extensive experiments suggest that our Changen has superior generation capability, and the change detectors with Changen pre-training exhibit excellent transferability to real-world change datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2023 | None |

The availability of robust Geographic Information System (GIS) layers can benefit the management of infrastructure inventories, especially at local government level with urban planners responsible for the deployment and maintenance of such infrastructure. However, many cities still lack real-time information on the location, connectivity, and width of footpaths, and/or employ costly and manual survey means to gather this information. This work designs and implements an automatic pipeline for generating footpath networks based on remote sensing images using machine learning models. The annotation of segmentation tasks, especially labeling remote sensing images with specialized requirements, is very expensive, so we aim to introduce a pipeline requiring less labeled data. Considering supervised methods require large amounts of training data, we use a self-supervised method for feature representation learning to reduce annotation requirements. Then the pre-trained model is used as the encoder of the U-Net for footpath segmentation. Based on the generated masks, the footpath polygons are extracted and converted to footpath networks which can be loaded and visualized by geographic information systems conveniently. Validation results indicate considerable consistency when compared to manually collected GIS layers. The footpath network generation pipeline proposed in this work is low-cost and extensible, and it can be applied where remote sensing images are available.

It has many applications including tracking forest fires, detecting changes in land use and land cover, crop health monitoring, and so on. With the success of efficient deep learning methods (i.e., efficient deep neural networks) for real-time semantic segmentation in computer vision, researchers have adopted these efficient deep neural networks in remote sensing image analysis. This paper begins with a summary of the fundamental compression methods for designing efficient deep neural networks and provides a brief but comprehensive survey, outlining the recent developments in real-time semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery. We examine several seminal efficient deep learning methods, placing them in a taxonomy based on the network architecture design approach. Furthermore, we evaluate the quality and efficiency of some existing efficient deep neural networks on a publicly available remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmark dataset, the OpenEarthMap. The experimental results of an extensive comparative study demonstrate that most of the existing efficient deep neural networks have good segmentation quality, but they suffer low inference speed (i.e., high latency rate), which may limit their capability of deployment in real-time applications of remote sensing image segmentation.

Nevertheless, the security and robustness of deep learning models deserve special attention when addressing safety-critical remote sensing tasks. In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of backdoor attacks for remote sensing data, where both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks are considered. While most of the existing backdoor attack algorithms rely on visible triggers like squared patches with well-designed patterns, we propose a novel wavelet transform-based attack (WABA) method, which can achieve invisible attacks by injecting the trigger image into the poisoned image in the low-frequency domain. In this way, the high-frequency information in the trigger image can be filtered out in the attack, resulting in stealthy data poisoning. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can significantly cheat the current state-of-the-art deep learning models with a high attack success rate. We further analyze how different trigger images and the hyper-parameters in the wavelet transform would influence the performance of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on four benchmark remote sensing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks and thus highlight the importance of designing advanced backdoor defense algorithms to address this threat in remote sensing scenarios.

One notable model is Visual ChatGPT, which combines ChatGPT's LLM capabilities with visual computation to enable effective image analysis. The model's ability to process images based on textual inputs can revolutionize diverse fields. However, its application in the remote sensing domain remains unexplored. This is the first paper to examine the potential of Visual ChatGPT, a cutting-edge LLM founded on the GPT architecture, to tackle the aspects of image processing related to the remote sensing domain. Among its current capabilities, Visual ChatGPT can generate textual descriptions of images, perform canny edge and straight line detection, and conduct image segmentation. These offer valuable insights into image content and facilitate the interpretation and extraction of information. By exploring the applicability of these techniques within publicly available datasets of satellite images, we demonstrate the current model's limitations in dealing with remote sensing images, highlighting its challenges and future prospects. Although still in early development, we believe that the combination of LLMs and visual models holds a significant potential to transform remote sensing image processing, creating accessible and practical application opportunities in the field.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Reconstructing Sea Surface Temperature Images: A Masked Autoencoder Approach for Cloud Masking and Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00835v1)** | 2023-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This thesis presents a new algorithm to mitigate cloud masking in the analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) data generated by remote sensing technologies, e.g., Clouds interfere with the analysis of all remote sensing data using wavelengths shorter than 12 microns, significantly limiting the quantity of usable data and creating a biased geographical distribution (towards equatorial and coastal regions). To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called Enki which uses a Vision Transformer with Masked Autoencoding to reconstruct masked pixels. We train four different models of Enki with varying mask ratios (t) of 10%, 35%, 50%, and 75% on the generated Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) dataset referred to as LLC4320. To evaluate performance, we reconstruct a validation set of LLC4320 SST images with random ``clouds'' corrupting p=10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% of the images with individual patches of 4x4 pixel^2. We consistently find that at all levels of p there is one or multiple models that reconstruct the images with a mean RMSE of less than 0.03K, i.e. lower than the estimated sensor error of VIIRS data. Similarly, at the individual patch level, the reconstructions have RMSE 8x smaller than the fluctuations in the patch. And, as anticipated, reconstruction errors are larger for images with a higher degree of complexity. Our analysis also reveals that patches along the image border have systematically higher reconstruction error; we recommend ignoring these in production. We conclude that Enki shows great promise to surpass in-painting as a means of reconstructing cloud masking. Future research will develop Enki to reconstruct real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 18 figures; Masters Thesis</p></details> | None |
| **[Self-Training Guided Disentangled Adaptation for Cross-Domain Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05526v3)** | 2023-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation technology has achieved great success used in many real-world applications such as geographic element analysis. However, strong dependency on annotated data of specific scene makes it hard for DCNNs to fit different RS scenes. To solve this problem, recent works gradually focus on cross-domain RS image semantic segmentation task. In this task, different ground sampling distance, remote sensing sensor variation and different geographical landscapes are three main factors causing dramatic domain shift between source and target images. To decrease the negative influence of domain shift, we propose a self-training guided disentangled adaptation network (ST-DASegNet). We first propose source student backbone and target student backbone to respectively extract the source-style and target-style feature for both source and target images. Towards the intermediate output feature maps of each backbone, we adopt adversarial learning for alignment. Then, we propose a domain disentangled module to extract the universal feature and purify the distinct feature of source-style and target-style features. Finally, these two features are fused and served as input of source student decoder and target student decoder to generate final predictions. Based on our proposed domain disentangled module, we further propose exponential moving average (EMA) based cross-domain separated self-training mechanism to ease the instability and disadvantageous effect during adversarial optimization. Extensive experiments and analysis on benchmark RS datasets show that ST-DASegNet outperforms previous methods on cross-domain RS image semantic segmentation task and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

Existing RSCD methods usually formulate RSCD as a binary classification task, representing changes of interest by merely feature concatenation or feature subtraction and recovering the spatial details via densely connected change representations, whose performances need further improvement. In this paper, we propose STNet, a RSCD network based on spatial and temporal feature fusions. Specifically, we design a temporal feature fusion (TFF) module to combine bi-temporal features using a cross-temporal gating mechanism for emphasizing changes of interest; a spatial feature fusion module is deployed to capture fine-grained information using a cross-scale attention mechanism for recovering the spatial details of change representations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets for RSCD demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

The success of such methods relies on the availability of large databases of high-resolution remote sensing images with high-quality annotations. The CrowdAI Mapping Challenge Dataset is one of these datasets that has been used extensively in recent years to train deep neural networks. This dataset consists of $ \sim\ $280k training images and $ \sim\ $60k testing images, with polygonal building annotations for all images. However, issues such as low-quality and incorrect annotations, extensive duplication of image samples, and data leakage significantly reduce the utility of deep neural networks trained on the dataset. Therefore, it is an imperative pre-condition to adopt a data validation pipeline that evaluates the quality of the dataset prior to its use. To this end, we propose a drop-in pipeline that employs perceptual hashing techniques for efficient de-duplication of the dataset and identification of instances of data leakage between training and testing splits. In our experiments, we demonstrate that nearly 250k($ \sim\ $90%) images in the training split were identical. Moreover, our analysis on the validation split demonstrates that roughly 56k of the 60k images also appear in the training split, resulting in a data leakage of 93%. The source code used for the analysis and de-duplication of the CrowdAI Mapping Challenge dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/yeshwanth95/CrowdAI_Hash_and_search .</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/yeshwanth95/CrowdAI_Hash_and_search) |

Moreover, typical tasks such as classification and retrieval lack a systematic evaluation on standard benchmarks and training datasets, which make it hard to identify durable and generalizable scientific contributions. We aim at unifying remote sensing image retrieval and classification with a new large-scale training and testing dataset, SF300, including both vertical and oblique aerial images and made available to the research community, and an associated fine-tuning method.

These advanced devices can dynamically provide various and abundant multimodal remote sensing images with different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions according to different application requirements. Since then, it is of great scientific significance to carry out the research of multimodal remote sensing image registration, which is a crucial step for integrating the complementary information among multimodal data and making comprehensive observations and analysis of the Earths surface.

In recent years, state-of-the-art methods are dedicated to ``scale decoupling'' and ``semantic decoupling'' strategies to further enhance the capability of representation. However, these previous approaches focus on either the disentangling scale or semantics but ignore merging these two ideas in a union model, which extremely limits the performance of cross-modal retrieval models. To address these issues, we propose a novel Scale-Semantic Joint Decoupling Network (SSJDN) for remote sensing image-text retrieval. Specifically, we design the Bidirectional Scale Decoupling (BSD) module, which exploits Salience Feature Extraction (SFE) and Salience-Guided Suppression (SGS) units to adaptively extract potential features and suppress cumbersome features at other scales in a bidirectional pattern to yield different scale clues. Besides, we design the Label-supervised Semantic Decoupling (LSD) module by leveraging the category semantic labels as prior knowledge to supervise images and texts probing significant semantic-related information. Finally, we design a Semantic-guided Triple Loss (STL), which adaptively generates a constant to adjust the loss function to improve the probability of matching the same semantic image and text and shorten the convergence time of the retrieval model. Our proposed SSJDN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in numerical experiments conducted on four benchmark remote sensing datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

The rich and detailed spectral information provided by the hyperspectral sensors has improved the monitoring and detection capabilities of the earth surface substances. However, the high dimensionality of the hyperspectral images (HSI) is one of the main challenges for the analysis of the collected data. The existence of noisy, redundant and irrelevant bands increases the computational complexity, induce the Hughes phenomenon and decrease the target's classification accuracy. Hence, the dimensionality reduction is an essential step to face the dimensionality challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel filter approach based on the maximization of the spectral interaction measure and the support vector machines for dimensionality reduction and classification of the HSI. The proposed Max Relevance Max Synergy (MRMS) algorithm evaluates the relevance of every band through the combination of spectral synergy, redundancy and relevance measures. Our objective is to select the optimal subset of synergistic bands providing accurate classification of the supervised scene materials. Experimental results have been performed using three different hyperspectral datasets: "Indiana Pine", "Pavia University" and "Salinas" provided by the "NASA-AVIRIS" and the "ROSIS" spectrometers.

The classification of HSI is one of the most challenging tasks due to the large amount of spectral information and the presence of redundant and irrelevant bands. Although great progresses have been made on classification techniques, few studies have been done to provide practical guidelines to determine the appropriate classifier for HSI. In this paper, we investigate the performance of four supervised learning algorithms, namely, Support Vector Machines SVM, Random Forest RF, K-Nearest Neighbors KNN and Linear Discriminant Analysis LDA with different kernels in terms of classification accuracies. The experiments have been performed on three real hyperspectral datasets taken from the NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Sensor AVIRIS and the Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer ROSIS sensors. The mutual information had been used to reduce the dimensionality of the used datasets for better classification efficiency. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the SVM classifier with RBF kernel and RF produced statistically better results and seems to be respectively the more suitable as supervised classifiers for the hyperspectral remote sensing images.

As the image sensors are distant from the earth ground, it is likely that part of the area of interests is covered by cloud. Moreover, the atmosphere in between creates a constant haze layer upon the acquired images. To recover the ground image, we propose to use scattering model for temporal sequence of images of any scene in the framework of low rank and sparse models. We further develop its variant, which is much faster and yet more accurate. To measure the performance of different methods {\em objectively}, we develop a semi-realistic simulation method to produce cloud cover so that various methods can be quantitatively analysed, which enables detailed study of many aspects of cloud removal algorithms, including verifying the effectiveness of proposed models in comparison with the state-of-the-arts, including deep learning models, and addressing the long standing problem of the determination of regularisation parameters.

However, significant regions of them are facing deforestation and degradation due to several reasons. Diverse government and private initiatives were created to monitor and alert for deforestation increases from remote sensing images, using different ways to deal with the notable amount of generated data. Citizen Science projects can also be used to reach the same goal. Citizen Science consists of scientific research involving nonprofessional volunteers for analyzing, collecting data, and using their computational resources to outcome advancements in science and to increase the public's understanding of problems in specific knowledge areas such as astronomy, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. In this sense, this work presents a Citizen Science project called ForestEyes, which uses volunteer's answers through the analysis and classification of remote sensing images to monitor deforestation regions in rainforests.

In this work, we focus on a challenging task of land analysis, i.e., automatic extraction of traffic roads from remote sensing data, which has widespread applications in urban development and expansion estimation. Nevertheless, conventional methods either only utilized the limited information of aerial images, or simply fused multimodal information (e.g., vehicle trajectories), thus cannot well recognize unconstrained roads. To facilitate this problem, we introduce a novel neural network framework termed Cross-Modal Message Propagation Network (CMMPNet), which fully benefits the complementary different modal data (i.e., aerial images and crowdsourced trajectories). Specifically, CMMPNet is composed of two deep Auto-Encoders for modality-specific representation learning and a tailor-designed Dual Enhancement Module for cross-modal representation refinement. In particular, the complementary information of each modality is comprehensively extracted and dynamically propagated to enhance the representation of another modality. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our CMMPNet for robust road extraction benefiting from blending different modal data, either using image and trajectory data or image and Lidar data.

Addressing such a problem represents an exciting research field, which paves the way for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic land segmentation based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). As a classic architecture, FPN can build a feature pyramid with high-level semantics throughout. However, intrinsic defects in feature extraction and fusion hinder FPN from further aggregating more discriminative features. Hence, we propose an Attention Aggregation Module (AAM) to enhance multi-scale feature learning through attention-guided feature aggregation. Based on FPN and AAM, a novel framework named Attention Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network (A2-FPN) is developed for semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remotely sensed images. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our A2 -FPN in segmentation accuracy.

The subject of image fusion in two-dimensional (2D) space has been covered in several published reviews. However, the special case of 2.5D/3D Digital Elevation Model (DEM) fusion has not been addressed till date. DEM fusion is a key application of data fusion in remote sensing. It takes advantage of the complementary characteristics of multi-source DEMs to deliver a more complete, accurate and reliable elevation dataset. Although several methods for fusing DEMs have been developed, the absence of a well-rounded review has limited their proliferation among researchers and end-users. It is often required to combine knowledge from multiple studies to inform a holistic perspective and guide further research. In response, this paper provides a systematic review of DEM fusion: the pre-processing workflow, methods and applications, enhanced with a meta-analysis. Through the discussion and comparative analysis, unresolved challenges and open issues were identified, and future directions for research were proposed. This review is a timely solution and an invaluable source of information for researchers within the fields of remote sensing and spatial information science, and the data fusion community at large.</p></details> |  | None |

Most previous works adopt a self-supervised method which uses pseudo-labeled samples to guide subsequent training and testing. However, deep networks commonly require many high-quality samples for parameter optimization. The noise in pseudo-labels inevitably affects the final change detection performance. To solve the problem, we propose a Graph-based Knowledge Supplement Network (GKSNet). To be more specific, we extract discriminative information from the existing labeled dataset as additional knowledge, to suppress the adverse effects of noisy samples to some extent. Afterwards, we design a graph transfer module to distill contextual information attentively from the labeled dataset to the target dataset, which bridges feature correlation between datasets. To validate the proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments on four SAR datasets, which demonstrated the superiority of the proposed GKSNet as compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

As the rapidly increasing number of Deep Learning (DL) based landcover methods and training strategies are claimed to be the state-of-the-art, the already fragmented technical landscape of landcover mapping methods has been further complicated. Although there exists a plethora of literature review work attempting to guide researchers in making an informed choice of landcover mapping methods, the articles either focus on the review of applications in a specific area or revolve around general deep learning models, which lack a systematic view of the ever advancing landcover mapping methods. In addition, issues related to training samples and model transferability have become more critical than ever in an era dominated by data-driven approaches, but these issues were addressed to a lesser extent in previous review articles regarding remote sensing classification. Therefore, in this paper, we present a systematic overview of existing methods by starting from learning methods and varying basic analysis units for landcover mapping tasks, to challenges and solutions on three aspects of scalability and transferability with a remote sensing classification focus including (1) sparsity and imbalance of data; (2) domain gaps across different geographical regions; and (3) multi-source and multi-view fusion. We discuss in detail each of these categorical methods and draw concluding remarks in these developments and recommend potential directions for the continued endeavor.</p></details> | 29 pages | None |

Unsupervised learning could bring enormous benefit to the processing of hyperspectral images and to other remote sensing data analysis because labelled data are often scarce in this field. We propose a method for clustering the pixels of hyperspectral images using sparse coefficients computed from a representative dictionary as features. We show empirically that the proposed method works more effectively than clustering on the original pixels. We also demonstrate that our approach, in certain circumstances, outperforms the clustering results of features extracted using principal component analysis and non-negative matrix factorisation. Furthermore, our method is suitable for applications in repetitively clustering an ever-growing amount of high-dimensional data, which is the case when working with hyperspectral satellite imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sprin...</summary><p>Springer Machine Learning Journal, 8 pages, 3 figures</p></details> | None |

In most remote sensing applications such as counting objects requires only location estimation of objects. Hence, locating object centroids in aerial/satellite images is an easy solution for tasks where the object's exact shape is not necessary. Thus, this study focuses on assessing the feasibility of using deep neural networks for locating object centroids in satellite images. Name of our model is Centroid-UNet. The Centroid-UNet model is based on classic U-Net semantic segmentation architecture. We modified and adapted the U-Net semantic segmentation architecture into a centroid detection model preserving the simplicity of the original model. Furthermore, we have tested and evaluated our model with two case studies involving aerial/satellite images. Those two case studies are building centroid detection case study and coconut tree centroid detection case study. Our evaluation results have reached comparably good accuracy compared to other methods, and also offer simplicity. The code and models developed under this study are also available in the Centroid-UNet GitHub repository: https://github.com/gicait/centroid-unet</p></details> | <details><summary>Procc...</summary><p>Proccedings of the 42nd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, 2021, Can Tho city, Vietnam</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/gicait/centroid-unet) |
| **[Deep-Learning-Based Single-Image Height Reconstruction from Very-High-Resolution SAR Intensity Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.02061v2)** | 2021-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Originally developed in fields such as robotics and autonomous driving with image-based navigation in mind, deep learning-based single-image depth estimation (SIDE) has found great interest in the wider image analysis community. Remote sensing is no exception, as the possibility to estimate height maps from single aerial or satellite imagery bears great potential in the context of topographic reconstruction. A few pioneering investigations have demonstrated the general feasibility of single image height prediction from optical remote sensing images and motivate further studies in that direction. With this paper, we present the first-ever demonstration of deep learning-based single image height prediction for the other important sensor modality in remote sensing: synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Besides the adaptation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for SAR intensity images, we present a workflow for the generation of training data, and extensive experimental results for different SAR imaging modes and test sites. Since we put a particular emphasis on transferability, we are able to confirm that deep learning-based single-image height estimation is not only possible, but also transfers quite well to unseen data, even if acquired by different imaging modes and imaging parameters.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Scale-aware Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation of Multi-resolution Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07935v4)** | 2021-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assigning geospatial objects with specific categories at the pixel level is a fundamental task in remote sensing image analysis. Along with rapid development in sensor technologies, remotely sensed images can be captured at multiple spatial resolutions (MSR) with information content manifested at different scales. Extracting information from these MSR images represents huge opportunities for enhanced feature representation and characterisation. However, MSR images suffer from two critical issues: 1) increased scale variation of geo-objects and 2) loss of detailed information at coarse spatial resolutions. To bridge these gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel scale-aware neural network (SaNet) for semantic segmentation of MSR remotely sensed imagery. SaNet deploys a densely connected feature network (DCFFM) module to capture high-quality multi-scale context, such that the scale variation is handled properly and the quality of segmentation is increased for both large and small objects. A spatial feature recalibration (SFRM) module is further incorporated into the network to learn intact semantic content with enhanced spatial relationships, where the negative effects of information loss are removed. The combination of DCFFM and SFRM allows SaNet to learn scale-aware feature representation, which outperforms the existing multi-scale feature representation. Extensive experiments on three semantic segmentation datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SaNet in cross-resolution segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

To build effective deep learning models in these applications, deep few-shot learning methods have been developed and prove to be a robust approach in small training data. The analysis of building change detection from high spatial resolution remote sensing observations is important research in photogrammetry, computer vision, and remote sensing nowadays, which can be widely used in a variety of real-world applications, such as map updating. As manual high resolution image interpretation is expensive and time-consuming, building change detection methods are of high interest. The interest in developing building change detection approaches from optical remote sensing images is rapidly increasing due to larger coverages, and lower costs of optical images. In this study, we focus on building change detection analysis on a small set of building change from different regions that sit in several cities. In this paper, a new deep few-shot learning method is proposed for building change detection using Monte Carlo dropout and remote sensing observations. The setup is based on a small dataset, including bitemporal optical images labeled for building change detection.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |

We conducted extensive evaluation of the proposed methods in different applications (12 datasets) in medical imaging and agricultural remote sensing, which are very distinct fields of knowledge and usually subject to data scarcity.

We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on elevation data, we also use the effect in inference. We perform an extensive analysis on several classification tasks and emphasize its effectiveness in detecting the same class on different scales.

Data quality is the key to enhance remote sensing applications and obtaining a clear and noise-free set of data is very difficult in most situations due to the varying acquisition (e.g., atmosphere and season), sensor, and platform (e.g., satellite angles and sensor characteristics) conditions. With the increasing development of satellites, nowadays Terabytes of remote sensing images can be acquired every day. Therefore, information and data fusion can be particularly important in the remote sensing community. The fusion integrates data from various sources acquired asynchronously for information extraction, analysis, and quality improvement. In this chapter, we aim to discuss the theory of spatiotemporal fusion by investigating previous works, in addition to describing the basic concepts and some of its applications by summarizing our prior and ongoing works.</p></details> |  | None |

In the visual domain its applications are mostly studied in the context of images of natural scenes. However, its applicability is especially interesting in specific areas, like remote sensing and medicine, where it is hard to obtain huge amounts of labeled data. In this work, we conduct an extensive analysis of the applicability of self-supervised learning in remote sensing image classification. We analyze the influence of the number and domain of images used for self-supervised pre-training on the performance on downstream tasks. We show that, for the downstream task of remote sensing image classification, using self-supervised pre-training on remote sensing images can give better results than using supervised pre-training on images of natural scenes. Besides, we also show that self-supervised pre-training can be easily extended to multispectral images producing even better results on our downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Earth...</summary><p>EarthVision 2021 paper</p></details> | None |

In particular, UAVs equipped with camera sensors can operating in remote and difficult to access disaster-stricken areas, analyze the image and alert in the presence of various calamities such as collapsed buildings, flood, or fire in order to faster mitigate their effects on the environment and on human population. However, the integration of deep learning introduces heavy computational requirements, preventing the deployment of such deep neural networks in many scenarios that impose low-latency constraints on inference, in order to make mission-critical decisions in real time. To this end, this article focuses on the efficient aerial image classification from on-board a UAV for emergency response/monitoring applications. Specifically, a dedicated Aerial Image Database for Emergency Response applications is introduced and a comparative analysis of existing approaches is performed. Through this analysis a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture is proposed, referred to as EmergencyNet, based on atrous convolutions to process multiresolution features and capable of running efficiently on low-power embedded platforms achieving upto 20x higher performance compared to existing models with minimal memory requirements with less than 1% accuracy drop compared to state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>C.Kyr...</summary><p>C.Kyrkou and T.

Current methods for cloud/shadow identification in geospatial imagery are not as accurate as they should, especially in the presence of snow and haze. This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for the detection of cloud/shadow in Landsat 8 images. Our method benefits from a convolutional neural network, Cloud-Net+ (a modification of our previously proposed Cloud-Net \cite{myigarss}) that is trained with a novel loss function (Filtered Jaccard Loss). The proposed loss function is more sensitive to the absence of foreground objects in an image and penalizes/rewards the predicted mask more accurately than other common loss functions. In addition, a sunlight direction-aware data augmentation technique is developed for the task of cloud shadow detection to extend the generalization ability of the proposed model by expanding existing training sets. The combination of Cloud-Net+, Filtered Jaccard Loss function, and the proposed augmentation algorithm delivers superior results on four public cloud/shadow detection datasets. Our experiments on Pascal VOC dataset exemplifies the applicability and quality of our proposed network and loss function in other computer vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages.

Deep learning based models may behave in unexpected manner when subjected to test data that has such distributional shifts from the training data, also called out-of-distribution (OOD) examples. Predictive uncertainly analysis is an emerging research topic which has not been explored much in context of satellite image analysis. Towards this, we adopt a Dirichlet Prior Network based model to quantify distributional uncertainty of deep learning models for remote sensing. The approach seeks to maximize the representation gap between the in-domain and OOD examples for a better identification of unknown examples at test time. Experimental results on three exemplary test scenarios show the efficacy of the model in satellite image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) has appeared in various fields in recent years, including Remote Sensing. Realizing that information extraction tasks for hyperspectral images are burdened by data-specific issues, we identify and address two major problems. Those are the Curse of Dimensionality which occurs due to the high-volume of the data cube and the class imbalance problem which is common in hyperspectral datasets. Dimensionality reduction is an essential preprocessing step to complement a hyperspectral image classification task. Therefore, we propose a feature extraction algorithm for dimensionality reduction, based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Evaluations are carried out on the Indian Pines dataset to demonstrate that significant improvements are achieved when using the reduced data in a classification task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards advancing the earthquake forecasting by machine learning of satellite data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04334v1)** | 2021-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amongst the available technologies for earthquake research, remote sensing has been commonly used due to its unique features such as fast imaging and wide image-acquisition range. Nevertheless, early studies on pre-earthquake and remote-sensing anomalies are mostly oriented towards anomaly identification and analysis of a single physical parameter. Many analyses are based on singular events, which provide a lack of understanding of this complex natural phenomenon because usually, the earthquake signals are hidden in the environmental noise. The universality of such analysis still is not being demonstrated on a worldwide scale. In this paper, we investigate physical and dynamic changes of seismic data and thereby develop a novel machine learning method, namely Inverse Boosting Pruning Trees (IBPT), to issue short-term forecast based on the satellite data of 1,371 earthquakes of magnitude six or above due to their impact on the environment. We have analyzed and compared our proposed framework against several states of the art machine learning methods using ten different infrared and hyperspectral measurements collected between 2006 and 2013. Our proposed method outperforms all the six selected baselines and shows a strong capability in improving the likelihood of earthquake forecasting across different earthquake databases.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, there has been an emergence of deep learning algorithms being applied to hyperspectral and multispectral imagery for remote sensing and biomedicine tasks. These multi-channel images come with their own unique set of challenges that must be addressed for effective image analysis. Challenges include limited ground truth (annotation is expensive and extensive labeling is often not feasible), and high dimensional nature of the data (each pixel is represented by hundreds of spectral bands), despite being presented by a large amount of unlabeled data and the potential to leverage multiple sensors/sources that observe the same scene. In this chapter, we will review recent advances in the community that leverage deep learning for robust hyperspectral image analysis despite these unique challenges -- specifically, we will review unsupervised, semi-supervised and active learning approaches to image analysis, as well as transfer learning approaches for multi-source (e.g. multi-sensor, or multi-temporal) image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a chapter in Hyperspectral Image Analysis.

Due to the rapid development and increasing of hyperspectral remote sensing technology, many methods have been developed for HSI classification but still a lack of achieving the better performance. A Frost Filtered Scale-Invariant Feature Transformation based MultiLayer Perceptron Classification (FFSIFT-MLPC) technique is introduced for classifying the hyperspectral image with higher accuracy and minimum time consumption. The FFSIFT-MLPC technique performs three major processes, namely preprocessing, feature extraction and classification using multiple layers. Initially, the hyperspectral image is divided into number of spectral bands. These bands are given as input in the input layer of perceptron. Then the Frost filter is used in FFSIFT-MLPC technique for preprocessing the input bands which helps to remove the noise from hyper-spectral image at the first hidden layer. After preprocessing task, texture, color and object features of hyper-spectral image are extracted at second hidden layer using Gaussian distributive scale-invariant feature transform. At the third hidden layer, Euclidean distance is measured between the extracted features and testing features. Finally, feature matching is carried out at the output layer for hyper-spectral image classification. The classified outputs are resulted in terms of spectral bands (i.e., different colors). Experimental analysis is performed with PSNR, classification accuracy, false positive rate and classification time with number of spectral bands. The results evident that presented FFSIFT-MLPC technique improves the hyperspectral image classification accuracy, PSNR and minimizes false positive rate as well as classification time than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

As a result of these investigations, promising new directions were identified for future research.

The proposed framework has an inpainting capability, thus mitigating the false negatives that are inevitable in remote sensing image analysis. Our framework breaks the limits of remote sensing and enables rapid estimation of inundation depth and topographic deformation, essential information for emergency response, including rescue and relief activities.

To reduce the computational complexity of redundant information and improve the efficiency of image processing, visual saliency models have been widely applied in this field. In this paper, a novel saliency detection model based on Contrast-weighted Dictionary Learning (CDL) is proposed for remote sensing images. Specifically, the proposed CDL learns salient and non-salient atoms from positive and negative samples to construct a discriminant dictionary, in which a contrast-weighted term is proposed to encourage the contrast-weighted patterns to be present in the learned salient dictionary while discouraging them from being present in the non-salient dictionary. Then, we measure the saliency by combining the coefficients of the sparse representation (SR) and reconstruction errors. Furthermore, by using the proposed joint saliency measure, a variety of saliency maps are generated based on the discriminant dictionary. Finally, a fusion method based on global gradient optimization is proposed to integrate multiple saliency maps. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Hyperspectral imagery includes varying bands of images. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most frequently used deep learning based methods for visual data processing. The use of CNN for HSI classification is also visible in recent works. These approaches are mostly based on 2D CNN. Whereas, the HSI classification performance is highly dependent on both spatial and spectral information. Very few methods have utilized the 3D CNN because of increased computational complexity. This letter proposes a Hybrid Spectral Convolutional Neural Network (HybridSN) for HSI classification. Basically, the HybridSN is a spectral-spatial 3D-CNN followed by spatial 2D-CNN. The 3D-CNN facilitates the joint spatial-spectral feature representation from a stack of spectral bands. The 2D-CNN on top of the 3D-CNN further learns more abstract level spatial representation. Moreover, the use of hybrid CNNs reduces the complexity of the model compared to 3D-CNN alone. To test the performance of this hybrid approach, very rigorous HSI classification experiments are performed over Indian Pines, Pavia University and Salinas Scene remote sensing datasets. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art hand-crafted as well as end-to-end deep learning based methods. A very satisfactory performance is obtained using the proposed HybridSN for HSI classification.

Recently, deep learning techniques have outperformed classical model-based despeckling algorithms. However, such methods require clean ground truth images for training, thus resorting to synthetically speckled optical images since clean SAR images cannot be acquired. In this paper, inspired by recent works on blind-spot denoising networks, we propose a self-supervised Bayesian despeckling method. The proposed method is trained employing only noisy images and can therefore learn features of real SAR images rather than synthetic data. We show that the performance of the proposed network is very close to the supervised training approach on synthetic data and competitive on real data.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, remote sensing systems are usually constructed to optimize sensing cost-quality trade-offs with respect to human image interpretability. While some recent studies have explored remote sensing system design as a function of simple computer vision algorithm performance, there has been little work relating this design to the state-of-the-art in computer vision: deep learning with convolutional neural networks. We develop experimental systems to conduct this analysis, showing results with modern deep learning algorithms and recent overhead image data. Our results are compared to standard image quality measurements based on human visual perception, and we conclude not only that machine and human interpretability differ significantly, but that computer vision performance is largely self-consistent across a range of disparate conditions. This research is presented as a cornerstone for a new generation of sensor design systems which focus on computer algorithm performance instead of human visual perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</p></details> | None |
| **[A Structured Approach to the Analysis of Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09317v2)** | 2020-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of studies for the analysis of remote sensing images has been growing exponentially in the last decades. Many studies, however, only report results---in the form of certain performance metrics---by a few selected algorithms on a training and testing sample. While this often yields valuable insights, it tells little about some important aspects. For example, one might be interested in understanding the nature of a study by the interaction of algorithm, features, and the sample as these collectively contribute to the outcome; among these three, which would be a more productive direction in improving a study; how to assess the sample quality or the value of a set of features etc. With a focus on land-use classification, we advocate the use of a structured analysis. The output of a study is viewed as the result of the interplay among three input dimensions: feature, sample, and algorithm. Similarly, another dimension, the error, can be decomposed into error along each input dimension. Such a structural decomposition of the inputs or error could help better understand the nature of the problem and potentially suggest directions for improvement. We use the analysis of a remote sensing image at a study site in Guangzhou, China, to demonstrate how such a structured analysis could be carried out and what insights it generates. The structured analysis could be applied to a new study, or as a diagnosis to an existing one. We expect this will inform practice in the analysis of remote sensing images, and help advance the state-of-the-art of land-use classification.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures | None |

This is especially true for an automated analysis of remote sensing images on a global scale, which enables us to address global challenges such as urbanization and climate change using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. To meet these pressing needs, especially in urban research, we provide open access to a valuable benchmark dataset named "So2Sat LCZ42," which consists of local climate zone (LCZ) labels of about half a million Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches in 42 urban agglomerations (plus 10 additional smaller areas) across the globe. This dataset was labeled by 15 domain experts following a carefully designed labeling work flow and evaluation process over a period of six months. As rarely done in other labeled remote sensing dataset, we conducted rigorous quality assessment by domain experts. The dataset achieved an overall confidence of 85%. We believe this LCZ dataset is a first step towards an unbiased globallydistributed dataset for urban growth monitoring using machine learning methods, because LCZ provide a rather objective measure other than many other semantic land use and land cover classifications. It provides measures of the morphology, compactness, and height of urban areas, which are less dependent on human and culture. This dataset can be accessed from http://doi.org/10.14459/2018mp1483140.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article submitted to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> | None |

Image processing is the main data processing on satellites, in this paper, we focus on image denoising which is the basic image processing. There are many high-performance denoising approaches at present, however, most of them rely on advanced computing resources or rich images on the ground. Considering the limited computing resources of satellites and the characteristics of remote sensing images, we do some research on these high-performance ground image denoising approaches and compare them in simulation experiments to analyze whether they are suitable for satellites. According to the analysis results, we propose two feasible image denoising strategies for satellites based on satellite TianZhi-1.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, ICNC-FSKD 2019</p></details> | None |
| **[What, Where and How to Transfer in SAR Target Recognition Based on Deep CNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01379v1)** | 2019-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have attracted much attention in remote sensing recently. Compared with the large-scale annotated dataset in natural images, the lack of labeled data in remote sensing becomes an obstacle to train a deep network very well, especially in SAR image interpretation. Transfer learning provides an effective way to solve this problem by borrowing the knowledge from the source task to the target task. In optical remote sensing application, a prevalent mechanism is to fine-tune on an existing model pre-trained with a large-scale natural image dataset, such as ImageNet. However, this scheme does not achieve satisfactory performance for SAR application because of the prominent discrepancy between SAR and optical images. In this paper, we attempt to discuss three issues that are seldom studied before in detail: (1) what network and source tasks are better to transfer to SAR targets, (2) in which layer are transferred features more generic to SAR targets and (3) how to transfer effectively to SAR targets recognition. Based on the analysis, a transitive transfer method via multi-source data with domain adaptation is proposed in this paper to decrease the discrepancy between the source data and SAR targets. Several experiments are conducted on OpenSARShip. The results indicate that the universal conclusions about transfer learning in natural images cannot be completely applied to SAR targets, and the analysis of what and where to transfer in SAR target recognition is helpful to decide how to transfer more effectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Over the past two decades, a large amount of research on this task has been carried out, which mainly focuses on the following three core issues: feature extraction, similarity metric and relevance feedback. Due to the complexity and multiformity of ground objects in high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images, there is still room for improvement in the current retrieval approaches. In this paper, we analyze the three core issues of RS image retrieval and provide a comprehensive review on existing methods. Furthermore, for the goal to advance the state-of-the-art in HRRS image retrieval, we focus on the feature extraction issue and delve how to use powerful deep representations to address this task. We conduct systematic investigation on evaluating correlative factors that may affect the performance of deep features. By optimizing each factor, we acquire remarkable retrieval results on publicly available HRRS datasets. Finally, we explain the experimental phenomenon in detail and draw conclusions according to our analysis. Our work can serve as a guiding role for the research of content-based RS image retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

To provide a quantitative representation of channel networks, we propose a new method that extracts channels from remotely sensed images and estimates their widths. Our fully automated method is based on a recently proposed Multiscale Singularity Index that responds strongly to curvilinear structures but weakly to edges. The algorithm produces a channel map, using a single image where water and non-water pixels have contrast, such as a Landsat near-infrared band image or a water index defined on multiple bands. The proposed method provides a robust alternative to the procedures that are used in remote sensing of fluvial geomorphology and makes classification and analysis of channel networks easier.

Accurate and efficient detection of cloud and cloud shadow is an essential step to harness the value of remotely sensed data for almost all downstream analysis. DeepMask, a new algorithm for cloud and cloud shadow detection in optical satellite remote sensing imagery, is proposed in this study. DeepMask utilizes ResNet, a deep convolutional neural network, for pixel-level cloud mask generation. The algorithm is trained and evaluated on the Landsat 8 Cloud Cover Assessment Validation Dataset distributed across 8 different land types. Compared with CFMask, the most widely used cloud detection algorithm, land-type-specific DeepMask models achieve higher accuracy across all land types. The average accuracy is 93.56%, compared with 85.36% from CFMask. DeepMask also achieves 91.02% accuracy on all-land-type dataset. Compared with other CNN-based cloud mask algorithms, DeepMask benefits from the parsimonious architecture and the residual connection of ResNet. It is compatible with input of any size and shape. DeepMask still maintains high performance when using only red, green, blue, and NIR bands, indicating its potential to be applied to other satellite platforms that only have limited optical bands.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

With the increasing availability of multi-temporal remote sensing images, numerous change detection algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, image transformation methods with feature extraction and mapping could effectively highlight the changed information and thus has better change detection performance. However, changes of multi-temporal images are usually complex, existing methods are not effective enough. In recent years, deep network has shown its brilliant performance in many fields including feature extraction and projection. Therefore, in this paper, based on deep network and slow feature analysis (SFA) theory, we proposed a new change detection algorithm for multi-temporal remotes sensing images called Deep Slow Feature Analysis (DSFA). In DSFA model, two symmetric deep networks are utilized for projecting the input data of bi-temporal imagery. Then, the SFA module is deployed to suppress the unchanged components and highlight the changed components of the transformed features. The CVA pre-detection is employed to find unchanged pixels with high confidence as training samples. Finally, the change intensity is calculated with chi-square distance and the changes are determined by threshold algorithms. The experiments are performed on two real-world datasets and a public hyperspectral dataset. The visual comparison and quantitative evaluation have both shown that DSFA could outperform the other state-of-the-art algorithms, including other SFA-based and deep learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions of Geoscience and Remote Sensing</p></details> | None |
| **[Boundary Loss for Remote Sensing Imagery Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07852v1)** | 2019-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In response to the growing importance of geospatial data, its analysis including semantic segmentation becomes an increasingly popular task in computer vision today. Convolutional neural networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features and practitioners widely use them to process remote sensing data. When performing remote sensing image segmentation, multiple instances of one class with precisely defined boundaries are often the case, and it is crucial to extract those boundaries accurately. The accuracy of segments boundaries delineation influences the quality of the whole segmented areas explicitly. However, widely-used segmentation loss functions such as BCE, IoU loss or Dice loss do not penalize misalignment of boundaries sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely a differentiable surrogate of a metric accounting accuracy of boundary detection. We can use the loss function with any neural network for binary segmentation. We performed validation of our loss function with various modifications of UNet on a synthetic dataset, as well as using real-world data (ISPRS Potsdam, INRIA AIL). Trained with the proposed loss function, models outperform baseline methods in terms of IoU score.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, bridging modern computer vision with remote sensing data analysis could have critical impact to the way we understand our environment and lead to major breakthroughs in global urban planning or climate change research. Keeping such bridging objective in mind, DeepGlobe aims to bring together researchers from different domains to raise awareness of remote sensing in the computer vision community and vice-versa. We aim to improve and evaluate state-of-the-art satellite image understanding approaches, which can hopefully serve as reference benchmarks for future research in the same topic.

For better visual perception of these images, it is essential to operate series of pre-processing and elementary corrections and then operate a series of main processing steps for more precise analysis on the images. There are several approaches for processing which are depended on the type of remote sensing images. The discussed approach in this article, i.e. image fusion, is the use of natural colors of an optical image for adding color to a grayscale satellite image which gives us the ability for better observation of the HR image of OLI sensor of Landsat-8. This process with emphasis on details of fusion technique has previously been performed; however, we are going to apply the concept of the interpolation process. In fact, we see many important software tools such as ENVI and ERDAS as the most famous remote sensing image processing tools have only classical interpolation techniques (such as bi-linear (BL) and bi-cubic/cubic convolution (CC)). Therefore, ENVI- and ERDAS-based researches in image fusion area and even other fusion researches often dont use new and better interpolators and are mainly concentrated on the fusion algorithms details for achieving a better quality, so we only focus on the interpolation impact on fusion quality in Landsat-8 multispectral images. The important feature of this approach is to use a statistical, adaptive, and edge-guided interpolation method for improving the color quality in the images in practice. Numerical simulations show selecting the suitable interpolation techniques in MRF-based images creates better quality than the classical interpolators.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

It has also been a challenging task in remote sensing research. In recent years, deep neural networks have made great achievement in improving accuracy of building extraction from remote sensing imagery. However, most of existing approaches usually require large amount of parameters and floating point operations for high accuracy, it leads to high memory consumption and low inference speed which are harmful to research. In this paper, we proposed a novel efficient network named ESFNet which employs separable factorized residual block and utilizes the dilated convolutions, aiming to preserve slight accuracy loss with low computational cost and memory consumption. Our ESFNet obtains a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, it can run at over 100 FPS on single Tesla V100, requires 6x fewer FLOPs and has 18x fewer parameters than state-of-the-art real-time architecture ERFNet while preserving similar accuracy without any additional context module, post-processing and pre-trained scheme. We evaluated our networks on WHU Building Dataset and compared it with other state-of-the-art architectures. The result and comprehensive analysis show that our networks are benefit for efficient remote sensing researches, and the idea can be further extended to other areas.

With the development of domestic remote sensing technology, the application of Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-resolution remote sensing images can greatly improve the accuracy of information extraction. This paper introduces an approach using object-oriented classification methods for urban feature extraction based on GF-2 satellite data. A combination of spectral, spatial attributes and membership functions was employed for mapping the urban features of Qinhuai District, Nanjing. The data preprocessing is carried out by ENVI software, and the subsequent data is exported into the eCognition software for object-oriented classification and extraction of urban feature information. Finally, the obtained raster image classification results are vectorized using the ARCGIS software, and the vector graphics are stored in the library, which can be used for further analysis and modeling. Accuracy assessment was performed using ground truth data acquired by visual interpretation and from other reliable secondary data sources. Compared with the result of pixel-based supervised (neural net) classification, the developed object-oriented method can significantly improve extraction accuracy, and after manual interpretation, an overall accuracy of 95.44% can be achieved, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.9405, which objectively confirmed the superiority of the object-oriented method and the feasibility of the utilization of GF-2 satellite data.</p></details> |  | None |

Hence, hyperspectral images captured from earth observing satellites and aircraft have been increasingly important in agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning, mining, and defense. Machine learning algorithms due to their outstanding predictive power have become a key tool for modern hyperspectral image analysis. Therefore, a solid understanding of machine learning techniques have become essential for remote sensing researchers and practitioners. This paper reviews and compares recent machine learning-based hyperspectral image analysis methods published in literature. We organize the methods by the image analysis task and by the type of machine learning algorithm, and present a two-way mapping between the image analysis tasks and the types of machine learning algorithms that can be applied to them. The paper is comprehensive in coverage of both hyperspectral image analysis tasks and machine learning algorithms. The image analysis tasks considered are land cover classification, target detection, unmixing, and physical parameter estimation. The machine learning algorithms covered are Gaussian models, linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, Gaussian mixture model, latent linear models, sparse linear models, Gaussian mixture models, ensemble learning, directed graphical models, undirected graphical models, clustering, Gaussian processes, Dirichlet processes, and deep learning.

| **[A Remote Sensing Image Dataset for Cloud Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00600v1)** | 2019-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud-based overlays are often present in optical remote sensing images, thus limiting the application of acquired data. Removing clouds is an indispensable pre-processing step in remote sensing image analysis. Deep learning has achieved great success in the field of remote sensing in recent years, including scene classification and change detection. However, deep learning is rarely applied in remote sensing image removal clouds. The reason is the lack of data sets for training neural networks. In order to solve this problem, this paper first proposed the Remote sensing Image Cloud rEmoving dataset (RICE). The proposed dataset consists of two parts: RICE1 contains 500 pairs of images, each pair has images with cloud and cloudless size of 512*512; RICE2 contains 450 sets of images, each set contains three 512*512 size images. , respectively, the reference picture without clouds, the picture of the cloud and the mask of its cloud.

The state-of-the-art performances of deep neural networks are conditioned to the availability of large number of accurately labeled samples. In practice, collecting large scale accurately labeled datasets is a challenging and tedious task in most scenarios of remote sensing image analysis, thus cheap surrogate procedures are employed to label the dataset. Training deep neural networks on such datasets with inaccurate labels easily overfits to the noisy training labels and degrades the performance of the classification tasks drastically. To mitigate this effect, we propose an original solution with entropic optimal transportation. It allows to learn in an end-to-end fashion deep neural networks that are, to some extent, robust to inaccurately labeled samples. We empirically demonstrate on several remote sensing datasets, where both scene and pixel-based hyperspectral images are considered for classification. Our method proves to be highly tolerant to significant amounts of label noise and achieves favorable results against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Consideration at Computer Vision and Image Understanding</p></details> | None |

More recently, a two-stage detector Faster R-CNN is proposed and demonstrated to be a promising tool for object detection in optical remote sensing images, while the sparse and dense characteristic of objects in remote sensing images is complexity. It is unreasonable to treat all images with the same region proposal strategy, and this treatment limits the performance of two-stage detectors. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach, named deep adaptive proposal network (DAPNet), address this complexity characteristic of object by learning a new category prior network (CPN) on the basis of the existing Faster R-CNN architecture. Moreover, the candidate regions produced by DAPNet model are different from the traditional region proposal network (RPN), DAPNet predicts the detail category of each candidate region. And these candidate regions combine the object number, which generated by the category prior network to achieve a suitable number of candidate boxes for each image. These candidate boxes can satisfy detection tasks in sparse and dense scenes. The performance of the proposed framework has been evaluated on the challenging NWPU VHR-10 data set. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

How to manage such richness leveraging its complementarity is a crucial chal- lenge in modern remote sensing analysis. Data Fusion techniques deal with this point proposing method to combine and exploit complementarity among the different data sensors. Considering optical Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) images, satellites obtain both Multi Spectral (MS) and panchro- matic (PAN) images at different spatial resolution. VHSR images are extensively exploited to produce land cover maps to deal with agricultural, ecological, and socioeconomic issues as well as assessing ecosystem status, monitoring biodiversity and provid- ing inputs to conceive food risk monitoring systems. Common techniques to produce land cover maps from such VHSR images typically opt for a prior pansharpening of the multi-resolution source for a full resolution processing. Here, we propose a new deep learning architecture to jointly use PAN and MS imagery for a direct classification without any prior image fusion or resampling process. By managing the spectral information at its native spatial resolution, our method, named MRFusion, aims at avoiding the possible infor- mation loss induced by pansharpening or any other hand-crafted preprocessing. Moreover, the proposed architecture is suitably designed to learn non-linear transformations of the sources with the explicit aim of taking as much as possible advantage of the complementarity of PAN and MS imagery. Experiments are carried out on two-real world scenarios depicting large areas with different land cover characteristics. The characteristics of the proposed scenarios underline the applicability and the generality of our method in operational settings.</p></details> |  | None |

In the past, most texture description approaches were based on dense orderless statistical distribution of local features. However, most recent approaches to texture recognition and remote sensing scene classification are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The d facto practice when learning these CNN models is to use RGB patches as input with training performed on large amounts of labeled data (ImageNet). In this paper, we show that Binary Patterns encoded CNN models, codenamed TEX-Nets, trained using mapped coded images with explicit texture information provide complementary information to the standard RGB deep models. Additionally, two deep architectures, namely early and late fusion, are investigated to combine the texture and color information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate Binary Patterns encoded CNNs and different deep network fusion architectures for texture recognition and remote sensing scene classification. We perform comprehensive experiments on four texture recognition datasets and four remote sensing scene classification benchmarks: UC-Merced with 21 scene categories, WHU-RS19 with 19 scene classes, RSSCN7 with 7 categories and the recently introduced large scale aerial image dataset (AID) with 30 aerial scene types. We demonstrate that TEX-Nets provide complementary information to standard RGB deep model of the same network architecture. Our late fusion TEX-Net architecture always improves the overall performance compared to the standard RGB network on both recognition problems. Our final combination outperforms the state-of-the-art without employing fine-tuning or ensemble of RGB network architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent convolutional neural network (ReCNN) architecture, which is trained to learn a joint spectral-spatial-temporal feature representation in a unified framework for change detection in multispectral images. To this end, we bring together a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) into one end-to-end network. The former is able to generate rich spectral-spatial feature representations, while the latter effectively analyzes temporal dependency in bi-temporal images. In comparison with previous approaches to change detection, the proposed network architecture possesses three distinctive properties: 1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most existing methods whose components are separately trained or computed; 2) it naturally harnesses spatial information that has been proven to be beneficial to change detection task; 3) it is capable of adaptively learning the temporal dependency between multitemporal images, unlike most of algorithms that use fairly simple operation like image differencing or stacking. As far as we know, this is the first time that a recurrent convolutional network architecture has been proposed for multitemporal remote sensing image analysis. The proposed network is validated on real multispectral data sets. Both visual and quantitative analysis of experimental results demonstrates competitive performance in the proposed mode.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a fully convolutional-deconvolutional network architecture being trained end-to-end, encompassing residual learning, to model the ambiguous mapping between monocular remote sensing images and height maps. Specifically, it is composed of two parts, i.e., convolutional sub-network and deconvolutional sub-network. The former corresponds to feature extractor that transforms the input remote sensing image to high-level multidimensional feature representation, whereas the latter plays the role of a height generator that produces height map from the feature extracted from the convolutional sub-network. Moreover, to preserve fine edge details of estimated height maps, we introduce a skip connection to the network, which is able to shuttle low-level visual information, e.g., object boundaries and edges, directly across the network. To demonstrate the usefulness of single-view height prediction, we show a practical example of instance segmentation of buildings using estimated height map. This paper, for the first time in the remote sensing community, attempts to estimate height from monocular vision. The proposed network is validated using a large-scale high resolution aerial image data set covered an area of Berlin.

Numerous works exist that merge information from remote sensing and images acquired from the ground for tasks like land cover mapping, object detection, or scene understanding. What makes the combination of overhead and street-level images challenging, is the strongly varying viewpoint, different scale, illumination, sensor modality and time of acquisition. Direct (dense) matching of images on a per-pixel basis is thus often impossible, and one has to resort to alternative strategies that will be discussed in this paper. We review recent works that attempt to combine images taken from the ground and overhead views for purposes like scene registration, reconstruction, or classification. Three methods that represent the wide range of potential methods and applications (change detection, image orientation, and tree cataloging) are described in detail. We show that cross-fertilization between remote sensing, computer vision and machine learning is very valuable to make the best of geographic data available from Earth Observation sensors and ground imagery. Despite its challenges, we believe that integrating these complementary data sources will lead to major breakthroughs in Big GeoData.</p></details> |  | None |

Here, we address the super-resolution of irregularly-sampled remote sensing images. Using an optimal interpolation as the low-resolution reconstruction, we explore locally-adapted multimodal convolutional models and investigate different dictionary-based decompositions, namely based on principal component analysis (PCA), sparse priors and non-negativity constraints. We consider an application to the reconstruction of sea surface height (SSH) fields from two information sources, along-track altimeter data and sea surface temperature (SST) data. The reported experiments demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model, especially locally-adapted parametrizations with non-negativity constraints, to outperform optimally-interpolated reconstructions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Multi-Task Learning for Segmentation of Building Footprints with Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05932v1)** | 2017-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increased availability of high resolution satellite imagery allows to sense very detailed structures on the surface of our planet. Access to such information opens up new directions in the analysis of remote sensing imagery. However, at the same time this raises a set of new challenges for existing pixel-based prediction methods, such as semantic segmentation approaches. While deep neural networks have achieved significant advances in the semantic segmentation of high resolution images in the past, most of the existing approaches tend to produce predictions with poor boundaries. In this paper, we address the problem of preserving semantic segmentation boundaries in high resolution satellite imagery by introducing a new cascaded multi-task loss. We evaluate our approach on Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset which contains large-scale and high resolution images. Our results show that we are able to outperform state-of-the-art methods by 8.3\% without any additional post-processing step.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sensing Urban Land-Use Patterns By Integrating Google Tensorflow And Scene-Classification Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01580v1)** | 2017-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid progress of China's urbanization, research on the automatic detection of land-use patterns in Chinese cities is of substantial importance. Deep learning is an effective method to extract image features. To take advantage of the deep-learning method in detecting urban land-use patterns, we applied a transfer-learning-based remote-sensing image approach to extract and classify features. Using the Google Tensorflow framework, a powerful convolution neural network (CNN) library was created. First, the transferred model was previously trained on ImageNet, one of the largest object-image data sets, to fully develop the model's ability to generate feature vectors of standard remote-sensing land-cover data sets (UC Merced and WHU-SIRI). Then, a random-forest-based classifier was constructed and trained on these generated vectors to classify the actual urban land-use pattern on the scale of traffic analysis zones (TAZs). To avoid the multi-scale effect of remote-sensing imagery, a large random patch (LRP) method was used. The proposed method could efficiently obtain acceptable accuracy (OA = 0.794, Kappa = 0.737) for the study area. In addition, the results show that the proposed method can effectively overcome the multi-scale effect that occurs in urban land-use classification at the irregular land-parcel level. The proposed method can help planners monitor dynamic urban land use and evaluate the impact of urban-planning schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[AID: A Benchmark Dataset for Performance Evaluation of Aerial Scene Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05167v1)** | 2017-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial scene classification, which aims to automatically label an aerial image with a specific semantic category, is a fundamental problem for understanding high-resolution remote sensing imagery. In recent years, it has become an active task in remote sensing area and numerous algorithms have been proposed for this task, including many machine learning and data-driven approaches. However, the existing datasets for aerial scene classification like UC-Merced dataset and WHU-RS19 are with relatively small sizes, and the results on them are already saturated. This largely limits the development of scene classification algorithms. This paper describes the Aerial Image Dataset (AID): a large-scale dataset for aerial scene classification. The goal of AID is to advance the state-of-the-arts in scene classification of remote sensing images. For creating AID, we collect and annotate more than ten thousands aerial scene images. In addition, a comprehensive review of the existing aerial scene classification techniques as well as recent widely-used deep learning methods is given. Finally, we provide a performance analysis of typical aerial scene classification and deep learning approaches on AID, which can be served as the baseline results on this benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Aggregation and visualization of spatial data with application to classification of land use and land cover](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05860v1)** | 2017-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggregation and visualization of geographical data are an important part of environmental data mining, environmental modelling, and agricultural management. However, it is difficult to aggregate geospatial data of the various formats, such as maps, census and survey data. This paper presents a framework named PlaniSphere, which can aggregate the various geospatial datasets, and synthesizes raw data. We developed an algorithm in PlaniSphere to aggregate remote sensing images with census data for classification and visualization of land use and land cover (LULC). The results show that the framework is able to classify geospatial data sets of LULC from multiple formats. National census data sets can be used for calibration of remote sensing LULC classifications. This provides a new approach for the classification of remote sensing data. This approach proposed in this paper should be useful for LULC classification in environmental spatial analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A New Pseudo-color Technique Based on Intensity Information Protection for Passive Sensor Imagery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02455v1)** | 2017-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image processing is so important in geo-sciences. Images which are obtained by different types of sensors might initially be unrecognizable. To make an acceptable visual perception in the images, some pre-processing steps (for removing noises and etc) are preformed which they affect the analysis of images. There are different types of processing according to the types of remote sensing images. The method that we are going to introduce in this paper is to use virtual colors to colorize the gray-scale images of satellite sensors. This approach helps us to have a better analysis on a sample single-band image which has been taken by Landsat-8 (OLI) sensor (as a multi-band sensor with natural color bands, its images' natural color can be compared to synthetic color by our approach). A good feature of this method is the original image reversibility in order to keep the suitable resolution of output images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Methods for Mapping Forest Disturbance and Degradation from Optical Earth Observation Data: a Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02470v4)** | 2017-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose of review: This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in remote sensing based monitoring of forest disturbances and forest degradation from optical Earth Observation data. Part one comprises an overview of currently available optical remote sensing sensors, which can be used for forest disturbance and degradation mapping. Part two reviews the two main categories of existing approaches: classical image-to-image change detection and time series analysis. Recent findings: With the launch of the Sentinel-2a satellite and available Landsat imagery, time series analysis has become the most promising but also most demanding category of degradation mapping approaches. Four time series classification methods are distinguished. The methods are explained and their benefits and drawbacks are discussed. A separate chapter presents a number of recent forest degradation mapping studies for two different ecosystems: temperate forests with a geographical focus on Europe and tropical forests with a geographical focus on Africa. Summary: The review revealed that a wide variety of methods for the detection of forest degradation is already available. Today, the main challenge is to transfer these approaches to high resolution time series data from multiple sensors. Future research should also focus on the classification of disturbance types and the development of robust up-scalable methods to enable near real time disturbance mapping in support of operational reactive measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the Authors' accepted version only!

| **[Convolutional Neural Network on Three Orthogonal Planes for Dynamic Texture Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05530v1)** | 2017-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Textures (DTs) are sequences of images of moving scenes that exhibit certain stationarity properties in time such as smoke, vegetation and fire. The analysis of DT is important for recognition, segmentation, synthesis or retrieval for a range of applications including surveillance, medical imaging and remote sensing. Deep learning methods have shown impressive results and are now the new state of the art for a wide range of computer vision tasks including image and video recognition and segmentation. In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently proven to be well suited for texture analysis with a design similar to a filter bank approach. In this paper, we develop a new approach to DT analysis based on a CNN method applied on three orthogonal planes x y , xt and y t . We train CNNs on spatial frames and temporal slices extracted from the DT sequences and combine their outputs to obtain a competitive DT classifier. Our results on a wide range of commonly used DT classification benchmark datasets prove the robustness of our approach. Significant improvement of the state of the art is shown on the larger datasets.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures | None |

These cameras are an important complement to satellite images by providing geoscientists with cheaper, faster, and more localized data. The images captured by whole sky imagers can have high spatial and temporal resolution, which is an important pre-requisite for applications such as solar energy modeling, cloud attenuation analysis, local weather prediction, etc. Extracting valuable information from the huge amount of image data by detecting and analyzing the various entities in these images is challenging. However, powerful machine learning techniques have become available to aid with the image analysis. This article provides a detailed walk-through of recent developments in these techniques and their applications in ground-based imaging. We aim to bridge the gap between computer vision and remote sensing with the help of illustrative examples. We demonstrate the advantages of using machine learning techniques in ground-based image analysis via three primary applications -- segmentation, classification, and denoising.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Non-parametric Image Registration of Airborne LiDAR, Hyperspectral and Photographic Imagery of Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0226v1)** | 2015-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is much current interest in using multi-sensor airborne remote sensing to monitor the structure and biodiversity of forests. This paper addresses the application of non-parametric image registration techniques to precisely align images obtained from multimodal imaging, which is critical for the successful identification of individual trees using object recognition approaches. Non-parametric image registration, in particular the technique of optimizing one objective function containing data fidelity and regularization terms, provides flexible algorithms for image registration. Using a survey of woodlands in southern Spain as an example, we show that non-parametric image registration can be successful at fusing datasets when there is little prior knowledge about how the datasets are interrelated (i.e. in the absence of ground control points). The validity of non-parametric registration methods in airborne remote sensing is demonstrated by a series of experiments. Precise data fusion is a prerequisite to accurate recognition of objects within airborne imagery, so non-parametric image registration could make a valuable contribution to the analysis pipeline.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[An Effective Image Feature Classiffication using an improved SOM](http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01723v1)** | 2015-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image feature classification is a challenging problem in many computer vision applications, specifically, in the fields of remote sensing, image analysis and pattern recognition. In this paper, a novel Self Organizing Map, termed improved SOM (iSOM), is proposed with the aim of effectively classifying Mammographic images based on their texture feature representation. The main contribution of the iSOM is to introduce a new node structure for the map representation and adopting a learning technique based on Kohonen SOM accordingly. The main idea is to control, in an unsupervised fashion, the weight updating procedure depending on the class reliability of the node, during the weight update time. Experiments held on a real Mammographic images. Results showed high accuracy compared to classical SOM and other state-of-art classifiers.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Image Fusion Techniques in Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5473v1)** | 2014-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image fusion is an effective way to use a large volume of data from multisensor images. Most earth satellites such as SPOT, Landsat 7, IKONOS and QuickBird provide both panchromatic (Pan) images at a higher spatial resolution and multispectral (MS) images at a lower spatial resolution and many remote sensing applications require both high spatial and high spectral resolutions, especially for GIS based applications. An effective image fusion technique can produce such remotely sensed images. Image fusion is the combination of two or more different images to form a new image by using a certain algorithm to obtain more and better information about an object or a study area than. The image fusion is performed at three different processing levels which are pixel level, feature level and decision level according to the stage at which the fusion takes place. There are many image fusion methods that can be used to produce high resolution multispectral images from a high resolution pan image and low resolution multispectral images. This paper explores the major remote sensing data fusion techniques at pixel level and reviews the concept, principals, limitations and advantages for each technique. This paper focused on traditional techniques like intensity hue-saturation- (HIS), Brovey, principal component analysis (PCA) and Wavelet.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Novel Histogram Based Robust Image Registration Technique](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.5619v1)** | 2014-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a method for Automatic Image Registration (AIR) through histogram is proposed. Automatic image registration is one of the crucial steps in the analysis of remotely sensed data. A new acquired image must be transformed, using image registration techniques, to match the orientation and scale of previous related images. This new approach combines several segmentations of the pair of images to be registered. A relaxation parameter on the histogram modes delineation is introduced. It is followed by characterization of the extracted objects through the objects area, axis ratio, and perimeter and fractal dimension. The matched objects are used for rotation and translation estimation. It allows for the registration of pairs of images with differences in rotation and translation. This method contributes to subpixel accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages and 6 figures. submit/0850305</p></details> | None |
| **[Effective Features of Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Interactive Adaptive Thresholding Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7743v1)** | 2014-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways to extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge detection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact that these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object foreground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be combined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively select threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature selection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote sensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three characteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection and reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics analysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction accuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding an image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of classification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of thresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of remote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive thresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our solution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image. Additionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective algorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for preprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable tool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the classification procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,International Conference on Intelligent Computing Applications - ICICA 2014</p></details> | None |

So, This paper attempts to undertake the study of Feature-Level based image fusion. For this purpose, feature based fusion techniques, which are usually based on empirical or heuristic rules, are employed. Hence, in this paper we consider feature extraction (FE) for fusion. It aims at finding a transformation of the original space that would produce such new features, which preserve or improve as much as possible. This study introduces three different types of Image fusion techniques including Principal Component Analysis based Feature Fusion (PCA), Segment Fusion (SF) and Edge fusion (EF). This paper also devotes to concentrate on the analytical techniques for evaluating the quality of image fusion (F) by using various methods including (SD), (En), (CC), (SNR), (NRMSE) and (DI) to estimate the quality and degree of information improvement of a fused image quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Image fusion, Feature, Edge Fusion, Segment Fusion, IHS, PCA</p></details> | None |

A new method for image fusion is proposed based on Weighted Average Merging Method (WAMM) in the NonSubsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) domain. A performance analysis on various statistical fusion rules are also analysed both in NSCT and Wavelet domain. Analysis has been made on medical images, remote sensing images and multi focus images. Experimental results shows that the proposed method, WAMM obtained better results in NSCT domain than the wavelet domain as it preserves more edges and keeps the visual quality intact in the fused image.</p></details> | 19 pages | None |
