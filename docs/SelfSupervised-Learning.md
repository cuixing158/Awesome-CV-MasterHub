| **[Fake Speech Wild: Detecting Deepfake Speech on Social Media Platform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10559v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of speech generation technology has led to the widespread proliferation of deepfake speech across social media platforms. While deepfake audio countermeasures (CMs) achieve promising results on public datasets, their performance degrades significantly in cross-domain scenarios. To advance CMs for real-world deepfake detection, we first propose the Fake Speech Wild (FSW) dataset, which includes 254 hours of real and deepfake audio from four different media platforms, focusing on social media. As CMs, we establish a benchmark using public datasets and advanced selfsupervised learning (SSL)-based CMs to evaluate current CMs in real-world scenarios. We also assess the effectiveness of data augmentation strategies in enhancing CM robustness for detecting deepfake speech on social media. Finally, by augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW training set, we significantly advanced real-world deepfake audio detection performance, achieving an average equal error rate (EER) of 3.54% across all evaluation sets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lung Nodule-SSM: Self-Supervised Lung Nodule Detection and Classification in Thoracic CT Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15120v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades, and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to develop more robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream tasks. Thus, we propose a novel "LungNodule-SSM" method, which utilizes selfsupervised learning with DINOv2 as a backbone to enhance lung nodule detection and classification without annotated data. Our methodology has two stages: firstly, the DINOv2 model is pre-trained on unlabeled CT scans to learn robust feature representations, then secondly, these features are fine-tuned using transformer-based architectures for lesionlevel detection and accurate lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA methods. Our experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method with an accuracy of 98.37%, explaining its effectiveness in lung nodule detection.

| **[THESAURUS: Contrastive Graph Clustering by Swapping Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11550v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph node clustering is a fundamental unsupervised task. Existing methods typically train an encoder through selfsupervised learning and then apply K-means to the encoder output. Some methods use this clustering result directly as the final assignment, while others initialize centroids based on this initial clustering and then finetune both the encoder and these learnable centroids. However, due to their reliance on K-means, these methods inherit its drawbacks when the cluster separability of encoder output is low, facing challenges from the Uniform Effect and Cluster Assimilation. We summarize three reasons for the low cluster separability in existing methods: (1) lack of contextual information prevents discrimination between similar nodes from different clusters; (2) training tasks are not sufficiently aligned with the downstream clustering task; (3) the cluster information in the graph structure is not appropriately exploited. To address these issues, we propose conTrastive grapH clustEring by SwApping fUsed gRomov-wasserstein coUplingS (THESAURUS). Our method introduces semantic prototypes to provide contextual information, and employs a cross-view assignment prediction pretext task that aligns well with the downstream clustering task. Additionally, it utilizes Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GW-OT) along with the proposed prototype graph to thoroughly exploit cluster information in the graph structure. To adapt to diverse real-world data, THESAURUS updates the prototype graph and the prototype marginal distribution in OT by using momentum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THESAURUS achieves higher cluster separability than the prior art, effectively mitigating the Uniform Effect and Cluster Assimilation issues</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Dual-branch PolSAR Image Classification Based on GraphMAE and Local Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04294v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The annotation of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, classifying PolSAR images with limited labels is a challenging task in remote sensing domain. In recent years, self-supervised learning approaches have proven effective in PolSAR image classification with sparse labels. However, we observe a lack of research on generative selfsupervised learning in the studied task. Motivated by this, we propose a dual-branch classification model based on generative self-supervised learning in this paper. The first branch is a superpixel-branch, which learns superpixel-level polarimetric representations using a generative self-supervised graph masked autoencoder. To acquire finer classification results, a convolutional neural networks-based pixel-branch is further incorporated to learn pixel-level features. Classification with fused dual-branch features is finally performed to obtain the predictions. Experimental results on the benchmark Flevoland dataset demonstrate that our approach yields promising classification results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Selfsupervised learning for pathological speech detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02572v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech production is a complex phenomenon, wherein the brain orchestrates a sequence of processes involving thought processing, motor planning, and the execution of articulatory movements. However, this intricate execution of various processes is susceptible to influence and disruption by various neurodegenerative pathological speech disorders, such as Parkinsons' disease, resulting in dysarthria, apraxia, and other conditions. These disorders lead to pathological speech characterized by abnormal speech patterns and imprecise articulation. Diagnosing these speech disorders in clinical settings typically involves auditory perceptual tests, which are time-consuming, and the diagnosis can vary among clinicians based on their experiences, biases, and cognitive load during the diagnosis. Additionally, unlike neurotypical speakers, patients with speech pathologies or impairments are unable to access various virtual assistants such as Alexa, Siri, etc. To address these challenges, several automatic pathological speech detection (PSD) approaches have been proposed. These approaches aim to provide efficient and accurate detection of speech disorders, thereby facilitating timely intervention and support for individuals affected by these conditions. These approaches mainly vary in two aspects: the input representations utilized and the classifiers employed. Due to the limited availability of data, the performance of detection remains subpar. Self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings, such as wav2vec2, and their multilingual versions, are being explored as a promising avenue to improve performance. These embeddings leverage self-supervised learning techniques to extract rich representations from audio data, thereby offering a potential solution to address the limitations posed by the scarcity of labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>in In...</summary><p>in Intersection of Book Chapter in Machine Leanring and Computational Social Sciences CRC (in progress) 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[STaR: Distilling Speech Temporal Relation for Lightweight Speech Self-Supervised Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09040v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Albeit great performance of Transformer-based speech selfsupervised learning (SSL) models, their large parameter size and computational cost make them unfavorable to utilize. In this study, we propose to compress the speech SSL models by distilling speech temporal relation (STaR). Unlike previous works that directly match the representation for each speech frame, STaR distillation transfers temporal relation between speech frames, which is more suitable for lightweight student with limited capacity. We explore three STaR distillation objectives and select the best combination as the final STaR loss. Our model distilled from HuBERT BASE achieves an overall score of 79.8 on SUPERB benchmark, the best performance among models with up to 27 million parameters. We show that our method is applicable across different speech SSL models and maintains robust performance with further reduced parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2024 Best Student Paper Awarded.

| **[Anomaly Correction of Business Processes Using Transformer Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10211v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event log records all events that occur during the execution of business processes, so detecting and correcting anomalies in event log can provide reliable guarantee for subsequent process analysis. The previous works mainly include next event prediction based methods and autoencoder-based methods. These methods cannot accurately and efficiently detect anomalies and correct anomalies at the same time, and they all rely on the set threshold to detect anomalies. To solve these problems, we propose a business process anomaly correction method based on Transformer autoencoder. By using self-attention mechanism and autoencoder structure, it can efficiently process event sequences of arbitrary length, and can directly output corrected business process instances, so that it can adapt to various scenarios. At the same time, the anomaly detection is transformed into a classification problem by means of selfsupervised learning, so that there is no need to set a specific threshold in anomaly detection. The experimental results on several real-life event logs show that the proposed method is superior to the previous methods in terms of anomaly detection accuracy and anomaly correction results while ensuring high running efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data-efficient Event Camera Pre-training via Disentangled Masked Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00416v1)** | 2024-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a new data-efficient voxel-based self-supervised learning method for event cameras. Our pre-training overcomes the limitations of previous methods, which either sacrifice temporal information by converting event sequences into 2D images for utilizing pre-trained image models or directly employ paired image data for knowledge distillation to enhance the learning of event streams. In order to make our pre-training data-efficient, we first design a semantic-uniform masking method to address the learning imbalance caused by the varying reconstruction difficulties of different regions in non-uniform data when using random masking. In addition, we ease the traditional hybrid masked modeling process by explicitly decomposing it into two branches, namely local spatio-temporal reconstruction and global semantic reconstruction to encourage the encoder to capture local correlations and global semantics, respectively. This decomposition allows our selfsupervised learning method to converge faster with minimal pre-training data. Compared to previous approaches, our self-supervised learning method does not rely on paired RGB images, yet enables simultaneous exploration of spatial and temporal cues in multiple scales. It exhibits excellent generalization performance and demonstrates significant improvements across various tasks with fewer parameters and lower computational costs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-supervised learning with diffusion-based multichannel speech enhancement for speaker verification under noisy conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02244v1)** | 2023-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper introduces Diff-Filter, a multichannel speech enhancement approach based on the diffusion probabilistic model, for improving speaker verification performance under noisy and reverberant conditions. It also presents a new two-step training procedure that takes the benefit of self-supervised learning. In the first stage, the Diff-Filter is trained by conducting timedomain speech filtering using a scoring-based diffusion model. In the second stage, the Diff-Filter is jointly optimized with a pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN speaker verification model under a self-supervised learning framework. We present a novel loss based on equal error rate. This loss is used to conduct selfsupervised learning on a dataset that is not labelled in terms of speakers. The proposed approach is evaluated on MultiSV, a multichannel speaker verification dataset, and shows significant improvements in performance under noisy multichannel conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Listen2YourHeart: A Self-Supervised Approach for Detecting Murmur in Heart-Beat Sounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14845v4)** | 2022-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heart murmurs are abnormal sounds present in heartbeats, caused by turbulent blood flow through the heart. The PhysioNet 2022 challenge targets automatic detection of murmur from audio recordings of the heart and automatic detection of normal vs. abnormal clinical outcome. The recordings are captured from multiple locations around the heart. Our participation investigates the effectiveness of selfsupervised learning for murmur detection. We train the layers of a backbone CNN in a self-supervised way with data from both this year's and the 2016 challenge. We use two different augmentations on each training sample, and normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss. We experiment with different augmentations to learn effective phonocardiogram representations. To build the final detectors we train two classification heads, one for each challenge task. We present evaluation results for all combinations of the available augmentations, and for our multipleaugmentation approach. Our team's, Listen2YourHeart, SSL murmur detection classifier received a weighted accuracy score of 0.737 (ranked 13th out of 40 teams) and an outcome identification challenge cost score of 11946 (ranked 7th out of 39 teams) on the hidden test set.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of CinC 2022 (https://cinc.org/).

| **[Self-supervised Learning for Heterogeneous Graph via Structure Information based on Metapath](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04218v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>graph neural networks (GNNs) are the dominant paradigm for modeling and handling graph structure data by learning universal node representation. The traditional way of training GNNs depends on a great many labeled data, which results in high requirements on cost and time. In some special scene, it is even unavailable and impracticable. Self-supervised representation learning, which can generate labels by graph structure data itself, is a potential approach to tackle this problem. And turning to research on self-supervised learning problem for heterogeneous graphs is more challenging than dealing with homogeneous graphs, also there are fewer studies about it. In this paper, we propose a SElfsupervised learning method for heterogeneous graph via Structure Information based on Metapath (SESIM). The proposed model can construct pretext tasks by predicting jump number between nodes in each metapath to improve the representation ability of primary task. In order to predict jump number, SESIM uses data itself to generate labels, avoiding time-consuming manual labeling. Moreover, predicting jump number in each metapath can effectively utilize graph structure information, which is the essential property between nodes. Therefore, SESIM deepens the understanding of models for graph structure. At last, we train primary task and pretext tasks jointly, and use meta-learning to balance the contribution of pretext tasks for primary task. Empirical results validate the performance of SESIM method and demonstrate that this method can improve the representation ability of traditional neural networks on link prediction task and node classification task.</p></details> | 32 pages | None |
| **[Variance-reduced Language Pretraining via a Mask Proposal Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05333v2)** | 2020-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning, a.k.a., pretraining, is important in natural language processing. Most of the pretraining methods first randomly mask some positions in a sentence and then train a model to recover the tokens at the masked positions. In such a way, the model can be trained without human labeling, and the massive data can be used with billion parameters. Therefore, the optimization efficiency becomes critical. In this paper, we tackle the problem from the view of gradient variance reduction. In particular, we first propose a principled gradient variance decomposition theorem, which shows that the variance of the stochastic gradient of the language pretraining can be naturally decomposed into two terms: the variance that arises from the sample of data in a batch, and the variance that arises from the sampling of the mask. The second term is the key difference between selfsupervised learning and supervised learning, which makes the pretraining slower. In order to reduce the variance of the second part, we leverage the importance sampling strategy, which aims at sampling the masks according to a proposal distribution instead of the uniform distribution. It can be shown that if the proposal distribution is proportional to the gradient norm, the variance of the sampling is reduced. To improve efficiency, we introduced a MAsk Proposal Network (MAPNet), which approximates the optimal mask proposal distribution and is trained end-to-end along with the model. According to the experimental result, our model converges much faster and achieves higher performance than the baseline BERT model.</p></details> |  | None |
