| **[An Adaptive, Disentangled Representation for Multidimensional MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24674v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new approach for representing and reconstructing multidimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Our method builds on a novel, learned feature-based image representation that disentangles different types of features, such as geometry and contrast, into distinct low-dimensional latent spaces, enabling better exploitation of feature correlations in multidimensional images and incorporation of pre-learned priors specific to different feature types for reconstruction. More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning. This work offers a new strategy for learning-based multidimensional image reconstruction where only limited data are available for problem-specific or task-specific training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Do Foundational Audio Encoders Understand Music Structure?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17209v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In music information retrieval (MIR) research, the use of pretrained foundational audio encoders (FAEs) has recently become a trend. FAEs pretrained on large amounts of music and audio data have been shown to improve performance on MIR tasks such as music tagging and automatic music transcription. However, their use for music structure analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. Although many open-source FAE models are available, only a small subset has been examined for MSA, and the impact of factors such as learning methods, training data, and model context length on MSA performance remains unclear. In this study, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 11 types of FAEs to investigate how these factors affect MSA performance. Our results demonstrate that FAEs using selfsupervised learning with masked language modeling on music data are particularly effective for MSA. These findings pave the way for future research in MSA.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging Code Graphs and Large Language Models for Better Code Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07666v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in code intelligence tasks such as code generation, summarization, and translation. However, their reliance on linearized token sequences limits their ability to understand the structural semantics of programs. While prior studies have explored graphaugmented prompting and structure-aware pretraining, they either suffer from prompt length constraints or require task-specific architectural changes that are incompatible with large-scale instructionfollowing LLMs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CGBridge, a novel plug-and-play method that enhances LLMs with Code Graph information through an external, trainable Bridge module. CGBridge first pre-trains a code graph encoder via selfsupervised learning on a large-scale dataset of 270K code graphs to learn structural code semantics. It then trains an external module to bridge the modality gap among code, graph, and text by aligning their semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. Finally, the bridge module generates structure-informed prompts, which are injected into a frozen LLM, and is fine-tuned for downstream code intelligence tasks. Experiments show that CGBridge achieves notable improvements over both the original model and the graphaugmented prompting method. Specifically, it yields a 16.19% and 9.12% relative gain in LLM-as-a-Judge on code summarization, and a 9.84% and 38.87% relative gain in Execution Accuracy on code translation. Moreover, CGBridge achieves over 4x faster inference than LoRA-tuned models, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in structure-aware code understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[SAND: A Self-supervised and Adaptive NAS-Driven Framework for Hardware Trojan Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23643v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The globalized semiconductor supply chain has made Hardware Trojans (HT) a significant security threat to embedded systems, necessitating the design of efficient and adaptable detection mechanisms. Despite promising machine learning-based HT detection techniques in the literature, they suffer from ad hoc feature selection and the lack of adaptivity, all of which hinder their effectiveness across diverse HT attacks. In this paper, we propose SAND, a selfsupervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient HT detection. Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions. (1) We leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) to enable automated feature extraction, eliminating the dependency on manually engineered features. (2) SAND integrates neural architecture search (NAS) to dynamically optimize the downstream classifier, allowing for seamless adaptation to unseen benchmarks with minimal fine-tuning. (3) Experimental results show that SAND achieves a significant improvement in detection accuracy (up to 18.3%) over state-of-the-art methods, exhibits high resilience against evasive Trojans, and demonstrates strong generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fake Speech Wild: Detecting Deepfake Speech on Social Media Platform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10559v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of speech generation technology has led to the widespread proliferation of deepfake speech across social media platforms. While deepfake audio countermeasures (CMs) achieve promising results on public datasets, their performance degrades significantly in cross-domain scenarios. To advance CMs for real-world deepfake detection, we first propose the Fake Speech Wild (FSW) dataset, which includes 254 hours of real and deepfake audio from four different media platforms, focusing on social media. As CMs, we establish a benchmark using public datasets and advanced selfsupervised learning (SSL)-based CMs to evaluate current CMs in real-world scenarios. We also assess the effectiveness of data augmentation strategies in enhancing CM robustness for detecting deepfake speech on social media. Finally, by augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW training set, we significantly advanced real-world deepfake audio detection performance, achieving an average equal error rate (EER) of 3.54% across all evaluation sets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SMCLM: Semantically Meaningful Causal Language Modeling for Autoregressive Paraphrase Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03415v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces semantically meaningful causal language modeling (SMCLM), a selfsupervised method of training autoregressive models to generate semantically equivalent text. Our approach involves using semantically meaningful text representation as an initial embedding in the autoregressive training and generation processes. The extensive empirical study demonstrates that the SMCLM approach makes autoregressive models capable of learning robust and high-quality paraphrase generation. The proposed method is competitive with the supervised method and achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised approaches. This article also presents a comprehensive set of automatic metrics that cover a wide range of autogenerated paraphrase evaluation aspects. Simultaneously, this article highlights the low reliability of the metrics that are widely used in paraphrase generation evaluation, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Multimodal NeRF for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19615v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework, referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs, our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera domain.

| **[Lung Nodule-SSM: Self-Supervised Lung Nodule Detection and Classification in Thoracic CT Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15120v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades, and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to develop more robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream tasks. Thus, we propose a novel "LungNodule-SSM" method, which utilizes selfsupervised learning with DINOv2 as a backbone to enhance lung nodule detection and classification without annotated data. Our methodology has two stages: firstly, the DINOv2 model is pre-trained on unlabeled CT scans to learn robust feature representations, then secondly, these features are fine-tuned using transformer-based architectures for lesionlevel detection and accurate lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA methods. Our experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method with an accuracy of 98.37%, explaining its effectiveness in lung nodule detection.

| **[Instruct-CLIP: Improving Instruction-Guided Image Editing with Automated Data Refinement Using Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18406v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although natural language instructions offer an intuitive way to guide automated image editing, deep-learning models often struggle to achieve high-quality results, largely due to the difficulty of creating large, high-quality training datasets. To do this, previous approaches have typically relied on text-to-image (T2I) generative models to produce pairs of original and edited images that simulate the input/output of an instruction-guided image-editing model. However, these image pairs often fail to align with the specified edit instructions due to the limitations of T2I models, which negatively impacts models trained on such datasets. To address this, we present Instruct-CLIP (I-CLIP), a selfsupervised method that learns the semantic changes between original and edited images to refine and better align the instructions in existing datasets. Furthermore, we adapt Instruct-CLIP to handle noisy latent images and diffusion timesteps so that it can be used to train latent diffusion models (LDMs) and efficiently enforce alignment between the edit instruction and the image changes in latent space at any step of the diffusion pipeline. We use Instruct-CLIP to correct the InstructPix2Pix dataset and get over 120K refined samples we then use to fine-tune their model, guided by our novel I-CLIP-based loss function. The resulting model can produce edits that are more aligned with the given instructions.

| **[THESAURUS: Contrastive Graph Clustering by Swapping Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11550v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph node clustering is a fundamental unsupervised task. Existing methods typically train an encoder through selfsupervised learning and then apply K-means to the encoder output. Some methods use this clustering result directly as the final assignment, while others initialize centroids based on this initial clustering and then finetune both the encoder and these learnable centroids. However, due to their reliance on K-means, these methods inherit its drawbacks when the cluster separability of encoder output is low, facing challenges from the Uniform Effect and Cluster Assimilation. We summarize three reasons for the low cluster separability in existing methods: (1) lack of contextual information prevents discrimination between similar nodes from different clusters; (2) training tasks are not sufficiently aligned with the downstream clustering task; (3) the cluster information in the graph structure is not appropriately exploited. To address these issues, we propose conTrastive grapH clustEring by SwApping fUsed gRomov-wasserstein coUplingS (THESAURUS). Our method introduces semantic prototypes to provide contextual information, and employs a cross-view assignment prediction pretext task that aligns well with the downstream clustering task. Additionally, it utilizes Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GW-OT) along with the proposed prototype graph to thoroughly exploit cluster information in the graph structure. To adapt to diverse real-world data, THESAURUS updates the prototype graph and the prototype marginal distribution in OT by using momentum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THESAURUS achieves higher cluster separability than the prior art, effectively mitigating the Uniform Effect and Cluster Assimilation issues</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[TabDeco: A Comprehensive Contrastive Framework for Decoupled Representations in Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11148v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning is a fundamental aspect of modern artificial intelligence, driving substantial improvements across diverse applications. While selfsupervised contrastive learning has led to significant advancements in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, its adaptation to tabular data presents unique challenges. Traditional approaches often prioritize optimizing model architecture and loss functions but may overlook the crucial task of constructing meaningful positive and negative sample pairs from various perspectives like feature interactions, instance-level patterns and batch-specific contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce TabDeco, a novel method that leverages attention-based encoding strategies across both rows and columns and employs contrastive learning framework to effectively disentangle feature representations at multiple levels, including features, instances and data batches. With the innovative feature decoupling hierarchies, TabDeco consistently surpasses existing deep learning methods and leading gradient boosting algorithms, including XG-Boost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, across various benchmark tasks, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing tabular data representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Natural GaLore: Accelerating GaLore for memory-efficient LLM Training and Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16029v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training LLMs presents significant memory challenges due to growing size of data, weights, and optimizer states. Techniques such as data and model parallelism, gradient checkpointing, and offloading strategies address this issue but are often infeasible due to hardware constraints. To mitigate memory usage, alternative methods like Parameter-Efficient-Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and GaLore approximate weights or optimizer states. PEFT methods, such as LoRA, have gained popularity for fine-tuning LLMs, though they require a full-rank warm start. In contrast, GaLore allows full-parameter learning while being more memory-efficient. This work introduces Natural GaLore, a simple drop in replacement for AdamW, which efficiently applies the inverse Empirical Fisher Information Matrix to low-rank gradients using Woodbury's Identity. We demonstrate that incorporating second-order information speeds up optimization significantly, especially when the iteration budget is limited. Empirical pretraining on 60M, 130M, 350M, and 1.1B parameter Llama models on C4 data demonstrate significantly lower perplexity over GaLore without additional memory overhead. By fine-tuning RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark using Natural GaLore, we demonstrate significant reduction in gap 86.05% vs 86.28% for full-finetuning. Furthermore, fine-tuning the TinyLlama 1.1B model for function calling using the TinyAgent framework shows that Natural GaLore achieving 83.09% accuracy on the TinyAgent dataset, significantly outperforms 16-bit LoRA at 80.06% and even surpasses GPT4-Turbo by 4%, all while using 30% less memory.

| **[Equivariance-based self-supervised learning for audio signal recovery from clipped measurements](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15283v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In numerous inverse problems, state-of-the-art solving strategies involve training neural networks from ground truth and associated measurement datasets that, however, may be expensive or impossible to collect. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques have emerged, with the major advantage of no longer requiring ground truth data. Most theoretical and experimental results on self-supervised learning focus on linear inverse problems. The present work aims to study self-supervised learning for the non-linear inverse problem of recovering audio signals from clipped measurements. An equivariance-based selfsupervised loss is proposed and studied. Performance is assessed on simulated clipped measurements with controlled and varied levels of clipping, and further reported on standard real music signals. We show that the performance of the proposed equivariance-based self-supervised declipping strategy compares favorably to fully supervised learning while only requiring clipped measurements alone for training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual-branch PolSAR Image Classification Based on GraphMAE and Local Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04294v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The annotation of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, classifying PolSAR images with limited labels is a challenging task in remote sensing domain. In recent years, self-supervised learning approaches have proven effective in PolSAR image classification with sparse labels. However, we observe a lack of research on generative selfsupervised learning in the studied task. Motivated by this, we propose a dual-branch classification model based on generative self-supervised learning in this paper. The first branch is a superpixel-branch, which learns superpixel-level polarimetric representations using a generative self-supervised graph masked autoencoder. To acquire finer classification results, a convolutional neural networks-based pixel-branch is further incorporated to learn pixel-level features. Classification with fused dual-branch features is finally performed to obtain the predictions. Experimental results on the benchmark Flevoland dataset demonstrate that our approach yields promising classification results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Selfsupervised learning for pathological speech detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02572v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech production is a complex phenomenon, wherein the brain orchestrates a sequence of processes involving thought processing, motor planning, and the execution of articulatory movements. However, this intricate execution of various processes is susceptible to influence and disruption by various neurodegenerative pathological speech disorders, such as Parkinsons' disease, resulting in dysarthria, apraxia, and other conditions. These disorders lead to pathological speech characterized by abnormal speech patterns and imprecise articulation. Diagnosing these speech disorders in clinical settings typically involves auditory perceptual tests, which are time-consuming, and the diagnosis can vary among clinicians based on their experiences, biases, and cognitive load during the diagnosis. Additionally, unlike neurotypical speakers, patients with speech pathologies or impairments are unable to access various virtual assistants such as Alexa, Siri, etc. To address these challenges, several automatic pathological speech detection (PSD) approaches have been proposed. These approaches aim to provide efficient and accurate detection of speech disorders, thereby facilitating timely intervention and support for individuals affected by these conditions. These approaches mainly vary in two aspects: the input representations utilized and the classifiers employed. Due to the limited availability of data, the performance of detection remains subpar. Self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings, such as wav2vec2, and their multilingual versions, are being explored as a promising avenue to improve performance. These embeddings leverage self-supervised learning techniques to extract rich representations from audio data, thereby offering a potential solution to address the limitations posed by the scarcity of labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>in In...</summary><p>in Intersection of Book Chapter in Machine Leanring and Computational Social Sciences CRC (in progress) 2024</p></details> | None |

In this study, we propose to compress the speech SSL models by distilling speech temporal relation (STaR). Unlike previous works that directly match the representation for each speech frame, STaR distillation transfers temporal relation between speech frames, which is more suitable for lightweight student with limited capacity. We explore three STaR distillation objectives and select the best combination as the final STaR loss. Our model distilled from HuBERT BASE achieves an overall score of 79.8 on SUPERB benchmark, the best performance among models with up to 27 million parameters. We show that our method is applicable across different speech SSL models and maintains robust performance with further reduced parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2024 Best Student Paper Awarded.

| **[Anomaly Correction of Business Processes Using Transformer Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10211v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event log records all events that occur during the execution of business processes, so detecting and correcting anomalies in event log can provide reliable guarantee for subsequent process analysis. The previous works mainly include next event prediction based methods and autoencoder-based methods. These methods cannot accurately and efficiently detect anomalies and correct anomalies at the same time, and they all rely on the set threshold to detect anomalies. To solve these problems, we propose a business process anomaly correction method based on Transformer autoencoder. By using self-attention mechanism and autoencoder structure, it can efficiently process event sequences of arbitrary length, and can directly output corrected business process instances, so that it can adapt to various scenarios. At the same time, the anomaly detection is transformed into a classification problem by means of selfsupervised learning, so that there is no need to set a specific threshold in anomaly detection. The experimental results on several real-life event logs show that the proposed method is superior to the previous methods in terms of anomaly detection accuracy and anomaly correction results while ensuring high running efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data-efficient Event Camera Pre-training via Disentangled Masked Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00416v1)** | 2024-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a new data-efficient voxel-based self-supervised learning method for event cameras. Our pre-training overcomes the limitations of previous methods, which either sacrifice temporal information by converting event sequences into 2D images for utilizing pre-trained image models or directly employ paired image data for knowledge distillation to enhance the learning of event streams. In order to make our pre-training data-efficient, we first design a semantic-uniform masking method to address the learning imbalance caused by the varying reconstruction difficulties of different regions in non-uniform data when using random masking. In addition, we ease the traditional hybrid masked modeling process by explicitly decomposing it into two branches, namely local spatio-temporal reconstruction and global semantic reconstruction to encourage the encoder to capture local correlations and global semantics, respectively. This decomposition allows our selfsupervised learning method to converge faster with minimal pre-training data. Compared to previous approaches, our self-supervised learning method does not rely on paired RGB images, yet enables simultaneous exploration of spatial and temporal cues in multiple scales. It exhibits excellent generalization performance and demonstrates significant improvements across various tasks with fewer parameters and lower computational costs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AdaptSSR: Pre-training User Model with Augmentation-Adaptive Self-Supervised Ranking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09706v2)** | 2023-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User modeling, which aims to capture users' characteristics or interests, heavily relies on task-specific labeled data and suffers from the data sparsity issue. Several recent studies tackled this problem by pre-training the user model on massive user behavior sequences with a contrastive learning task. Generally, these methods assume different views of the same behavior sequence constructed via data augmentation are semantically consistent, i.e., reflecting similar characteristics or interests of the user, and thus maximizing their agreement in the feature space. However, due to the diverse interests and heavy noise in user behaviors, existing augmentation methods tend to lose certain characteristics of the user or introduce noisy behaviors. Thus, forcing the user model to directly maximize the similarity between the augmented views may result in a negative transfer. To this end, we propose to replace the contrastive learning task with a new pretext task: Augmentation-Adaptive SelfSupervised Ranking (AdaptSSR), which alleviates the requirement of semantic consistency between the augmented views while pre-training a discriminative user model. Specifically, we adopt a multiple pairwise ranking loss which trains the user model to capture the similarity orders between the implicitly augmented view, the explicitly augmented view, and views from other users. We further employ an in-batch hard negative sampling strategy to facilitate model training. Moreover, considering the distinct impacts of data augmentation on different behavior sequences, we design an augmentation-adaptive fusion mechanism to automatically adjust the similarity order constraint applied to each sample based on the estimated similarity between the augmented views. Extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets with six downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of AdaptSSR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2023</p></details> | None |

In the second stage, the Diff-Filter is jointly optimized with a pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN speaker verification model under a self-supervised learning framework. We present a novel loss based on equal error rate. This loss is used to conduct selfsupervised learning on a dataset that is not labelled in terms of speakers. The proposed approach is evaluated on MultiSV, a multichannel speaker verification dataset, and shows significant improvements in performance under noisy multichannel conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning to Estimate 6DoF Pose from Limited Data: A Few-Shot, Generalizable Approach using RGB Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07598v1)** | 2023-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate estimation of six degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) object poses is essential for many applications in robotics and augmented reality. However, existing methods for 6DoF pose estimation often depend on CAD templates or dense support views, restricting their usefulness in realworld situations. In this study, we present a new cascade framework named Cas6D for few-shot 6DoF pose estimation that is generalizable and uses only RGB images. To address the false positives of target object detection in the extreme few-shot setting, our framework utilizes a selfsupervised pre-trained ViT to learn robust feature representations. Then, we initialize the nearest top-K pose candidates based on similarity score and refine the initial poses using feature pyramids to formulate and update the cascade warped feature volume, which encodes context at increasingly finer scales. By discretizing the pose search range using multiple pose bins and progressively narrowing the pose search range in each stage using predictions from the previous stage, Cas6D can overcome the large gap between pose candidates and ground truth poses, which is a common failure mode in sparse-view scenarios. Experimental results on the LINEMOD and GenMOP datasets demonstrate that Cas6D outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 9.2% and 3.8% accuracy (Proj-5) under the 32-shot setting compared to OnePose++ and Gen6D.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Self-Supervised Representations for Label Efficient Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer on Diabetic Retinopathy Fundus Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.11168v1)** | 2023-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel label-efficient selfsupervised representation learning-based approach for classifying diabetic retinopathy (DR) images in cross-domain settings. Most of the existing DR image classification methods are based on supervised learning which requires a lot of time-consuming and expensive medical domain experts-annotated data for training. The proposed approach uses the prior learning from the source DR image dataset to classify images drawn from the target datasets. The image representations learned from the unlabeled source domain dataset through contrastive learning are used to classify DR images from the target domain dataset. Moreover, the proposed approach requires a few labeled images to perform successfully on DR image classification tasks in cross-domain settings.

| **[Domain Adaptable Self-supervised Representation Learning on Remote Sensing Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09874v1)** | 2023-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel domain adaption paradigm for studying contrastive self-supervised representation learning and knowledge transfer using remote sensing satellite data. Major state-of-the-art remote sensing visual domain efforts primarily focus on fully supervised learning approaches that rely entirely on human annotations. On the other hand, human annotations in remote sensing satellite imagery are always subject to limited quantity due to high costs and domain expertise, making transfer learning a viable alternative. The proposed approach investigates the knowledge transfer of selfsupervised representations across the distinct source and target data distributions in depth in the remote sensing data domain. In this arrangement, self-supervised contrastive learning-based pretraining is performed on the source dataset, and downstream tasks are performed on the target datasets in a round-robin fashion. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets, UC Merced Landuse (UCMD), SIRI-WHU, and MLRSNet, for different downstream classification tasks versus label efficiency. In self-supervised knowledge transfer, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with label efficiency labels and outperforms a fully supervised setting. A more in-depth qualitative examination reveals consistent evidence for explainable representation learning. The source code and trained models are published on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2023.

The PhysioNet 2022 challenge targets automatic detection of murmur from audio recordings of the heart and automatic detection of normal vs. abnormal clinical outcome. The recordings are captured from multiple locations around the heart. Our participation investigates the effectiveness of selfsupervised learning for murmur detection. We train the layers of a backbone CNN in a self-supervised way with data from both this year's and the 2016 challenge. We use two different augmentations on each training sample, and normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss. We experiment with different augmentations to learn effective phonocardiogram representations. To build the final detectors we train two classification heads, one for each challenge task. We present evaluation results for all combinations of the available augmentations, and for our multipleaugmentation approach. Our team's, Listen2YourHeart, SSL murmur detection classifier received a weighted accuracy score of 0.737 (ranked 13th out of 40 teams) and an outcome identification challenge cost score of 11946 (ranked 7th out of 39 teams) on the hidden test set.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of CinC 2022 (https://cinc.org/).

| **[Self-supervised Learning for Heterogeneous Graph via Structure Information based on Metapath](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04218v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>graph neural networks (GNNs) are the dominant paradigm for modeling and handling graph structure data by learning universal node representation. The traditional way of training GNNs depends on a great many labeled data, which results in high requirements on cost and time. In some special scene, it is even unavailable and impracticable. Self-supervised representation learning, which can generate labels by graph structure data itself, is a potential approach to tackle this problem. And turning to research on self-supervised learning problem for heterogeneous graphs is more challenging than dealing with homogeneous graphs, also there are fewer studies about it. In this paper, we propose a SElfsupervised learning method for heterogeneous graph via Structure Information based on Metapath (SESIM). The proposed model can construct pretext tasks by predicting jump number between nodes in each metapath to improve the representation ability of primary task. In order to predict jump number, SESIM uses data itself to generate labels, avoiding time-consuming manual labeling. Moreover, predicting jump number in each metapath can effectively utilize graph structure information, which is the essential property between nodes. Therefore, SESIM deepens the understanding of models for graph structure. At last, we train primary task and pretext tasks jointly, and use meta-learning to balance the contribution of pretext tasks for primary task. Empirical results validate the performance of SESIM method and demonstrate that this method can improve the representation ability of traditional neural networks on link prediction task and node classification task.</p></details> | 32 pages | None |
| **[Preserve Pre-trained Knowledge: Transfer Learning With Self-Distillation For Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00506v1)** | 2022-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based action recognition is one of the most popular topics in computer vision. With recent advances of selfsupervised video representation learning approaches, action recognition usually follows a two-stage training framework, i.e., self-supervised pre-training on large-scale unlabeled sets and transfer learning on a downstream labeled set. However, catastrophic forgetting of the pre-trained knowledge becomes the main issue in the downstream transfer learning of action recognition, resulting in a sub-optimal solution. In this paper, to alleviate the above issue, we propose a novel transfer learning approach that combines self-distillation in fine-tuning to preserve knowledge from the pre-trained model learned from the large-scale dataset. Specifically, we fix the encoder from the last epoch as the teacher model to guide the training of the encoder from the current epoch in the transfer learning. With such a simple yet effective learning strategy, we outperform state-of-the-art methods on widely used UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets in action recognition task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-supervised Representation Learning for Reliable Robotic Monitoring of Fruit Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10135v2)** | 2022-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation can be a simple yet powerful tool for autonomous robots to fully utilise available data for selfsupervised identification of atypical scenes or objects. State-of-the-art augmentation methods arbitrarily embed "structural" peculiarity on typical images so that classifying these artefacts can provide guidance for learning representations for the detection of anomalous visual signals. In this paper, however, we argue that learning such structure-sensitive representations can be a suboptimal approach to some classes of anomaly (e.g., unhealthy fruits) which could be better recognised by a different type of visual element such as "colour". We thus propose Channel Randomisation as a novel data augmentation method for restricting neural networks to learn encoding of "colour irregularity" whilst predicting channel-randomised images to ultimately build reliable fruit-monitoring robots identifying atypical fruit qualities. Our experiments show that (1) this colour-based alternative can better learn representations for consistently accurate identification of fruit anomalies in various fruit species, and also, (2) unlike other methods, the validation accuracy can be utilised as a criterion for early stopping of training in practice due to positive correlation between the performance in the self-supervised colour-differentiation task and the subsequent detection rate of actual anomalous fruits. Also, the proposed approach is evaluated on a new agricultural dataset, Riseholme-2021, consisting of 3.5K strawberry images gathered by a mobile robot, which we share online to encourage active agri-robotics research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA2022; Codes and data are all available online</p></details> | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning of Domain Invariant Features for Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02594v4)** | 2021-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the problem of unsupervised synthetic-to-real domain adaptation for single image depth estimation. An essential building block of single image depth estimation is an encoder-decoder task network that takes RGB images as input and produces depth maps as output. In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy to force the task network to learn domain invariant representations in a selfsupervised manner. Specifically, we extend self-supervised learning from traditional representation learning, which works on images from a single domain, to domain invariant representation learning, which works on images from two different domains by utilizing an image-to-image translation network. Firstly, we use an image-to-image translation network to transfer domain-specific styles between synthetic and real domains. This style transfer operation allows us to obtain similar images from the different domains. Secondly, we jointly train our task network and Siamese network with the same images from the different domains to obtain domain invariance for the task network. Finally, we fine-tune the task network using labeled synthetic and unlabeled realworld data. Our training strategy yields improved generalization capability in the real-world domain. We carry out an extensive evaluation on two popular datasets for depth estimation, KITTI and Make3D. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on all metrics, e.g. by 14.7% on Sq Rel on KITTI. The source code and model weights will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages: 8 main pages with supplementary materials, accepted to WACV2022</p></details> | None |

We start with a baseline of patch based arrangement context learning and go from there. Our methods address some overt problems such as chromatic aberration as well as other potential problems such as spatial skew and mid-level feature neglect. We prevent problems with testing generalization on common self-supervised benchmark tests by using different datasets during our development. The results of our methods combined yield top scores on all standard self-supervised benchmarks, including classification and detection on PASCAL VOC 2007, segmentation on PASCAL VOC 2012, and "linear tests" on the ImageNet and CSAIL Places datasets. We obtain an improvement over our baseline method of between 4.0 to 7.1 percentage points on transfer learning classification tests. We also show results on different standard network architectures to demonstrate generalization as well as portability.

| **[Weakly-Supervised Cross-Domain Adaptation for Endoscopic Lesions Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04170v1)** | 2020-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised learning has attracted growing research attention on medical lesions segmentation due to significant saving in pixel-level annotation cost. However, 1) most existing methods require effective prior and constraints to explore the intrinsic lesions characterization, which only generates incorrect and rough prediction; 2) they neglect the underlying semantic dependencies among weakly-labeled target enteroscopy diseases and fully-annotated source gastroscope lesions, while forcefully utilizing untransferable dependencies leads to the negative performance. To tackle above issues, we propose a new weakly-supervised lesions transfer framework, which can not only explore transferable domain-invariant knowledge across different datasets, but also prevent the negative transfer of untransferable representations. Specifically, a Wasserstein quantified transferability framework is developed to highlight widerange transferable contextual dependencies, while neglecting the irrelevant semantic characterizations. Moreover, a novel selfsupervised pseudo label generator is designed to equally provide confident pseudo pixel labels for both hard-to-transfer and easyto-transfer target samples. It inhibits the enormous deviation of false pseudo pixel labels under the self-supervision manner. Afterwards, dynamically-searched feature centroids are aligned to narrow category-wise distribution shift. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments show the superiority of our model on the endoscopic dataset and several public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT 2020)</p></details> | None |
| **[Temporally Coherent Embeddings for Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02753v5)** | 2020-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents TCE: Temporally Coherent Embeddings for self-supervised video representation learning. The proposed method exploits inherent structure of unlabeled video data to explicitly enforce temporal coherency in the embedding space, rather than indirectly learning it through ranking or predictive proxy tasks. In the same way that high-level visual information in the world changes smoothly, we believe that nearby frames in learned representations will benefit from demonstrating similar properties. Using this assumption, we train our TCE model to encode videos such that adjacent frames exist close to each other and videos are separated from one another. Using TCE we learn robust representations from large quantities of unlabeled video data. We thoroughly analyse and evaluate our self-supervised learned TCE models on a downstream task of video action recognition using multiple challenging benchmarks (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51). With a simple but effective 2D-CNN backbone and only RGB stream inputs, TCE pre-trained representations outperform all previous selfsupervised 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN pre-trained on UCF101.

| **[Variance-reduced Language Pretraining via a Mask Proposal Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05333v2)** | 2020-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning, a.k.a., pretraining, is important in natural language processing. Most of the pretraining methods first randomly mask some positions in a sentence and then train a model to recover the tokens at the masked positions. In such a way, the model can be trained without human labeling, and the massive data can be used with billion parameters. Therefore, the optimization efficiency becomes critical. In this paper, we tackle the problem from the view of gradient variance reduction. In particular, we first propose a principled gradient variance decomposition theorem, which shows that the variance of the stochastic gradient of the language pretraining can be naturally decomposed into two terms: the variance that arises from the sample of data in a batch, and the variance that arises from the sampling of the mask. The second term is the key difference between selfsupervised learning and supervised learning, which makes the pretraining slower. In order to reduce the variance of the second part, we leverage the importance sampling strategy, which aims at sampling the masks according to a proposal distribution instead of the uniform distribution. It can be shown that if the proposal distribution is proportional to the gradient norm, the variance of the sampling is reduced. To improve efficiency, we introduced a MAsk Proposal Network (MAPNet), which approximates the optimal mask proposal distribution and is trained end-to-end along with the model. According to the experimental result, our model converges much faster and achieves higher performance than the baseline BERT model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Fast Adaptation for Denoising via Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02899v1)** | 2020-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Under certain statistical assumptions of noise, recent self-supervised approaches for denoising have been introduced to learn network parameters without true clean images, and these methods can restore an image by exploiting information available from the given input (i.e., internal statistics) at test time. However, self-supervised methods are not yet combined with conventional supervised denoising methods which train the denoising networks with a large number of external training samples. Thus, we propose a new denoising approach that can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art supervised denoising methods by adapting their network parameters to the given input through selfsupervision without changing the networks architectures. Moreover, we propose a meta-learning algorithm to enable quick adaptation of parameters to the specific input at test time. We demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily employed with state-of-the-art denoising networks without additional parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Deep Depth Denoising](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01193v2)** | 2019-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth perception is considered an invaluable source of information for various vision tasks. However, depth maps acquired using consumer-level sensors still suffer from non-negligible noise. This fact has recently motivated researchers to exploit traditional filters, as well as the deep learning paradigm, in order to suppress the aforementioned non-uniform noise, while preserving geometric details. Despite the effort, deep depth denoising is still an open challenge mainly due to the lack of clean data that could be used as ground truth. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional deep autoencoder that learns to denoise depth maps, surpassing the lack of ground truth data. Specifically, the proposed autoencoder exploits multiple views of the same scene from different points of view in order to learn to suppress noise in a self-supervised end-to-end manner using depth and color information during training, yet only depth during inference. To enforce selfsupervision, we leverage a differentiable rendering technique to exploit photometric supervision, which is further regularized using geometric and surface priors. As the proposed approach relies on raw data acquisition, a large RGB-D corpus is collected using Intel RealSense sensors. Complementary to a quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-supervised denoising approach on established 3D reconstruction applications.

Among a big body of recently proposed approaches for unsupervised learning of visual representations, a class of self-supervised techniques achieves superior performance on many challenging benchmarks. A large number of the pretext tasks for self-supervised learning have been studied, but other important aspects, such as the choice of convolutional neural networks (CNN), has not received equal attention. Therefore, we revisit numerous previously proposed self-supervised models, conduct a thorough large scale study and, as a result, uncover multiple crucial insights. We challenge a number of common practices in selfsupervised visual representation learning and observe that standard recipes for CNN design do not always translate to self-supervised representation learning. As part of our study, we drastically boost the performance of previously proposed techniques and outperform previously published state-of-the-art results by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>All t...</summary><p>All three authors contributed equally.

Thus, the proof of the Mirroring theorem provides a theoretical basis for the existence and a practical feasibility of constructing hierarchical classifiers, given the maps. Our proposed Mirroring Theorem can also be considered as an extension to Kolmogrovs theorem in providing a realistic solution for unsupervised classification. The techniques we develop, are general in nature and have led to the construction of learning machines which are (i) tree like in structure, (ii) modular (iii) with each module running on a common algorithm (tandem algorithm) and (iv) selfsupervised. We have actually built the architecture, developed the tandem algorithm of such a hierarchical classifier and demonstrated it on an example problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS 2009, ISSN 1947 5500, Impact Factor 0.423, http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/</p></details> | None |
