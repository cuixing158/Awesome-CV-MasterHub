| **[A fully automated urban PV parameterization framework for improved estimation of energy production profiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19876v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate parameterization of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations is critical for effective grid management and strategic large-scale solar deployment. The lack of high-fidelity datasets for PV configuration parameters often compels practitioners to rely on coarse assumptions, undermining both the temporal and numerical accuracy of large-scale PV performance modeling. This study introduces a fully automated framework that innovatively integrates remote sensing data, semantic segmentation, polygon-vector refinement, tilt-azimuth estimation, and module layout inference to produce a richly attributed GIS dataset of distributed PV. Applied to Eindhoven (the Netherlands), the method achieves a correlation ($R^2$) of 0.92 with Distribution System Operator (DSO) records, while capacity estimates for 73$\%$ of neighborhoods demonstrate agreement within a $\pm$25$\%$ margin of recorded data. Additionally, by accurately capturing actual system configuration parameters (e.g., tilt, azimuth, module layout) and seamlessly linking them to advanced performance models, the method yields more reliable PV energy generation forecasts within the distribution networks. Centering our experiments toward a high PV-penetration community, configuration-aware simulations help to reduce Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of energy generation modeling by up to 160$\%$ compared to the conventional assumption-based approaches. Furthermore, owing to its modular design and reliance on readily available geospatial resources, the workflow can be extended across diverse regions, offering a scalable solution for robust urban solar integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to Solar Energy for peer review. 42 pages, 15 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Pseudo Labels Generation Using SAM and CLIP for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19846v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis and autonomous driving and has a problem with the high cost of annotating the labels required in training. To address this problem, semantic segmentation methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets: PASCAL and MS COCO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[The Missing Point in Vision Transformers for Universal Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19795v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4 mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

| **[ADD-SLAM: Adaptive Dynamic Dense SLAM with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19420v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods have demonstrated exceptional localization precision and remarkable dense mapping performance. However, dynamic objects introduce critical challenges by disrupting scene consistency, leading to tracking drift and mapping artifacts. Existing methods that employ semantic segmentation or object detection for dynamic identification and filtering typically rely on predefined categorical priors, while discarding dynamic scene information crucial for robotic applications such as dynamic obstacle avoidance and environmental interaction. To overcome these challenges, we propose ADD-SLAM: an Adaptive Dynamic Dense SLAM framework based on Gaussian splitting. We design an adaptive dynamic identification mechanism grounded in scene consistency analysis, comparing geometric and textural discrepancies between real-time observations and historical maps. Ours requires no predefined semantic category priors and adaptively discovers scene dynamics. Precise dynamic object recognition effectively mitigates interference from moving targets during localization. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic-static separation mapping strategy that constructs a temporal Gaussian model to achieve online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate our method's flexible and accurate dynamic segmentation capabilities, along with state-of-the-art performance in both localization and mapping.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Joint Learning Framework with Feature Reconstruction and Prediction for Incomplete Satellite Image Time Series in Agricultural Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19159v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is crucial for agricultural semantic segmentation. However, Cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS, disrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, leading to degraded performance of models trained on complete SITS. Existing methods typically address this by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or using data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may introduce noise and redundancy, while the data-augmented model can only handle limited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint learning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address incomplete SITS more effectively. During training, we simulate data-missing scenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth labels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task constrains the model from selectively reconstructing critical features from masked inputs that align with the teacher's temporal feature representations. It reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation. By integrating reconstructed features into the prediction task, the model avoids learning shortcuts and maintains its ability to handle varied missing patterns and complete SITS. Experiments on SITS from Hunan Province, Western France, and Catalonia show that our method improves mean F1-scores by 6.93% in cropland extraction and 7.09% in crop classification over baselines. It also generalizes well across satellite sensors, including Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope, under varying temporal missing rates and model backbones.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SPARS: Self-Play Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Segmentation of Liver Tumours](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18989v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate tumour segmentation is vital for various targeted diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for cancer, e.g., planning biopsies or tumour ablations. Manual delineation is extremely labour-intensive, requiring substantial expert time. Fully-supervised machine learning models aim to automate such localisation tasks, but require a large number of costly and often subjective 3D voxel-level labels for training. The high-variance and subjectivity in such labels impacts model generalisability, even when large datasets are available. Histopathology labels may offer more objective labels but the infeasibility of acquiring pixel-level annotations to develop tumour localisation methods based on histology remains challenging in-vivo. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SPARS (Self-Play Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Segmentation), which utilises an object presence classifier, trained on a small number of image-level binary cancer presence labels, to localise cancerous regions on CT scans. Such binary labels of patient-level cancer presence can be sourced more feasibly from biopsies and histopathology reports, enabling a more objective cancer localisation on medical images. Evaluating with real patient data, we observed that SPARS yielded a mean dice score of $77.3 \pm 9.4$, which outperformed other weakly-supervised methods by large margins. This performance was comparable with recent fully-supervised methods that require voxel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate the potential of using SPARS to reduce the need for extensive human-annotated labels to detect cancer in real-world healthcare settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LLM-Guided Taxonomy and Hierarchical Uncertainty for 3D Point CLoud Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18924v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel active learning framework for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation that, for the first time, integrates large language models (LLMs) to construct hierarchical label structures and guide uncertainty-based sample selection. Unlike prior methods that treat labels as flat and independent, our approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse, label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to 4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%), substantially outperforming existing baselines. Our results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs as knowledge priors in 3D vision and establish hierarchical uncertainty modeling as a powerful paradigm for efficient point cloud annotation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SCHEME: Scalable Channel Mixer for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00412v4)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers have achieved impressive performance in many vision tasks. While the token mixer or attention block has been studied in great detail, much less research has been devoted to the channel mixer or feature mixing block (FFN or MLP), which accounts for a significant portion of the model parameters and computation. In this work, we show that the dense MLP connections can be replaced with a sparse block diagonal MLP structure that supports larger expansion ratios by splitting MLP features into groups. To improve the feature clusters formed by this structure we propose the use of a lightweight, parameter-free, channel covariance attention (CCA) mechanism as a parallel branch during training. This enables gradual feature mixing across channel groups during training whose contribution decays to zero as the training progresses to convergence. As a result, the CCA block can be discarded during inference, enabling enhanced performance at no additional computational cost. The resulting $\textit{Scalable CHannEl MixEr}$ (SCHEME) can be plugged into any ViT architecture to obtain a gamut of models with different trade-offs between complexity and performance by controlling the block diagonal MLP structure. This is shown by the introduction of a new family of SCHEMEformer models. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, with $\textbf{12 different ViT backbones}$, consistently demonstrate substantial accuracy/latency gains (upto $\textbf{1.5\% /20\%})$ over existing designs, especially for lower complexity regimes. The SCHEMEformer family is shown to establish new Pareto frontiers for accuracy vs FLOPS, accuracy vs model size, and accuracy vs throughput, especially for fast transformers of small size.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[REN: Fast and Efficient Region Encodings from Patch-Based Image Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18153v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Region Encoder Network (REN), a fast and effective model for generating region-based image representations using point prompts. Recent methods combine class-agnostic segmenters (e.g., SAM) with patch-based image encoders (e.g., DINO) to produce compact and effective region representations, but they suffer from high computational cost due to the segmentation step. REN bypasses this bottleneck using a lightweight module that directly generates region tokens, enabling 60x faster token generation with 35x less memory, while also improving token quality. It uses a few cross-attention blocks that take point prompts as queries and features from a patch-based image encoder as keys and values to produce region tokens that correspond to the prompted objects. We train REN with three popular encoders-DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP-and show that it can be extended to other encoders without dedicated training. We evaluate REN on semantic segmentation and retrieval tasks, where it consistently outperforms the original encoders in both performance and compactness, and matches or exceeds SAM-based region methods while being significantly faster. Notably, REN achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging Ego4D VQ2D benchmark and outperforms proprietary LMMs on Visual Haystacks' single-needle challenge.

| **[SemSegBench & DetecBench: Benchmarking Reliability and Generalization Beyond Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18015v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliability and generalization in deep learning are predominantly studied in the context of image classification. Yet, real-world applications in safety-critical domains involve a broader set of semantic tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, which come with a diverse set of dedicated model architectures. To facilitate research towards robust model design in segmentation and detection, our primary objective is to provide benchmarking tools regarding robustness to distribution shifts and adversarial manipulations. We propose the benchmarking tools SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH, along with the most extensive evaluation to date on the reliability and generalization of semantic segmentation and object detection models. In particular, we benchmark 76 segmentation models across four datasets and 61 object detectors across two datasets, evaluating their performance under diverse adversarial attacks and common corruptions. Our findings reveal systematic weaknesses in state-of-the-art models and uncover key trends based on architecture, backbone, and model capacity. SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH are open-sourced in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/benchmarking_reliability_generalization) along with our complete set of total 6139 evaluations. We anticipate the collected data to foster and encourage future research towards improved model reliability beyond classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First seven listed authors have equal contribution.

| **[Semantic segmentation with reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17905v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, pixel-level labeling is not always available. Sometimes, we need a semantic segmentation network, and even a visual encoder can have a high compatibility, and can be trained using various types of feedback beyond traditional labels, such as feedback that indicates the quality of the parsing results. To tackle this issue, we proposed RSS (Reward in Semantic Segmentation), the first practical application of reward-based reinforcement learning on pure semantic segmentation offered in two granular levels (pixel-level and image-level). RSS incorporates various novel technologies, such as progressive scale rewards (PSR) and pair-wise spatial difference (PSD), to ensure that the reward facilitates the convergence of the semantic segmentation network, especially under image-level rewards. Experiments and visualizations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed RSS can successfully ensure the convergence of the semantic segmentation network on two levels of rewards. Additionally, the RSS, which utilizes an image-level reward, outperforms existing weakly supervised methods that also rely solely on image-level signals during training.</p></details> | Tech report | None |
| **[Hephaestus Minicubes: A Global, Multi-Modal Dataset for Volcanic Unrest Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17782v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground deformation is regarded in volcanology as a key precursor signal preceding volcanic eruptions. Satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) enables consistent, global-scale deformation tracking; however, deep learning methods remain largely unexplored in this domain, mainly due to the lack of a curated machine learning dataset. In this work, we build on the existing Hephaestus dataset, and introduce Hephaestus Minicubes, a global collection of 38 spatiotemporal datacubes offering high resolution, multi-source and multi-temporal information, covering 44 of the world's most active volcanoes over a 7-year period. Each spatiotemporal datacube integrates InSAR products, topographic data, as well as atmospheric variables which are known to introduce signal delays that can mimic ground deformation in InSAR imagery. Furthermore, we provide expert annotations detailing the type, intensity and spatial extent of deformation events, along with rich text descriptions of the observed scenes. Finally, we present a comprehensive benchmark, demonstrating Hephaestus Minicubes' ability to support volcanic unrest monitoring as a multi-modal, multi-temporal classification and semantic segmentation task, establishing strong baselines with state-of-the-art architectures. This work aims to advance machine learning research in volcanic monitoring, contributing to the growing integration of data-driven methods within Earth science applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DiverseNet: Decision Diversified Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation Networks for Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13716v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to help reduce the cost of the manual labelling process by leveraging a substantial pool of unlabelled data alongside a limited set of labelled data during the training phase. Since pixel-level manual labelling in large-scale remote sensing imagery is expensive and time-consuming, semi-supervised learning has become a widely used solution to deal with this. However, the majority of existing SSL frameworks, especially various teacher-student frameworks, are too bulky to run efficiently on a GPU with limited memory. There is still a lack of lightweight SSL frameworks and efficient perturbation methods to promote the diversity of training samples and enhance the precision of pseudo labels during training. In order to fill this gap, we proposed a simple, lightweight, and efficient SSL architecture named \textit{DiverseHead}, which promotes the utilisation of multiple decision heads instead of multiple whole networks. Another limitation of most existing SSL frameworks is the insufficient diversity of pseudo labels, as they rely on the same network architecture and fail to explore different structures for generating pseudo labels. To solve this issue, we propose \textit{DiverseModel} to explore and analyse different networks in parallel for SSL to increase the diversity of pseudo labels. The two proposed methods, namely \textit{DiverseHead} and \textit{DiverseModel}, both achieve competitive semantic segmentation performance in four widely used remote sensing imagery datasets compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. Meanwhile, the proposed lightweight DiverseHead architecture can be easily applied to various state-of-the-art SSL methods while further improving their performance.

| **[EMRA-proxy: Enhancing Multi-Class Region Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images with Attention Proxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17665v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) image segmentation is challenging due to complex spatial layouts and diverse object appearances. While CNNs excel at capturing local features, they struggle with long-range dependencies, whereas Transformers can model global context but often neglect local details and are computationally expensive.We propose a novel approach, Region-Aware Proxy Network (RAPNet), which consists of two components: Contextual Region Attention (CRA) and Global Class Refinement (GCR). Unlike traditional methods that rely on grid-based layouts, RAPNet operates at the region level for more flexible segmentation. The CRA module uses a Transformer to capture region-level contextual dependencies, generating a Semantic Region Mask (SRM). The GCR module learns a global class attention map to refine multi-class information, combining the SRM and attention map for accurate segmentation.Experiments on three public datasets show that RAPNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior multi-class segmentation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC 2024): Poster Volume I.

| **[Deep mineralogical segmentation of thin section images based on QEMSCAN maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17008v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting the mineralogical aspects of rock thin sections is an important task for oil and gas reservoirs evaluation. However, human analysis tend to be subjective and laborious. Technologies like QEMSCAN(R) are designed to automate the mineralogical mapping process, but also suffer from limitations like high monetary costs and time-consuming analysis. This work proposes a Convolutional Neural Network model for automatic mineralogical segmentation of thin section images of carbonate rocks. The model is able to mimic the QEMSCAN mapping itself in a low-cost, generalized and efficient manner. For this, the U-Net semantic segmentation architecture is trained on plane and cross polarized thin section images using the corresponding QEMSCAN maps as target, which is an approach not widely explored. The model was instructed to differentiate occurrences of Calcite, Dolomite, Mg-Clay Minerals, Quartz, Pores and the remaining mineral phases as an unique class named "Others", while it was validated on rock facies both seen and unseen during training, in order to address its generalization capability. Since the images and maps are provided in different resolutions, image registration was applied to align then spatially. The study reveals that the quality of the segmentation is very much dependent on these resolution differences and on the variety of learnable rock textures. However, it shows promising results, especially with regard to the proper delineation of minerals boundaries on solid textures and precise estimation of the minerals distributions, describing a nearly linear relationship between expected and predicted distributions, with coefficient of determination (R^2) superior to 0.97 for seen facies and 0.88 for unseen.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OpenSeg-R: Improving Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16974v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R) |

| **[TextureSAM: Towards a Texture Aware Foundation Model for Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16540v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Models (SAM) have achieved remarkable success in object segmentation tasks across diverse datasets. However, these models are predominantly trained on large-scale semantic segmentation datasets, which introduce a bias toward object shape rather than texture cues in the image. This limitation is critical in domains such as medical imaging, material classification, and remote sensing, where texture changes define object boundaries. In this study, we investigate SAM's bias toward semantics over textures and introduce a new texture-aware foundation model, TextureSAM, which performs superior segmentation in texture-dominant scenarios. To achieve this, we employ a novel fine-tuning approach that incorporates texture augmentation techniques, incrementally modifying training images to emphasize texture features. By leveraging a novel texture-alternation of the ADE20K dataset, we guide TextureSAM to prioritize texture-defined regions, thereby mitigating the inherent shape bias present in the original SAM model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that TextureSAM significantly outperforms SAM-2 on both natural (+0.2 mIoU) and synthetic (+0.18 mIoU) texture-based segmentation datasets. The code and texture-augmented dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Style Transfer with Diffusion Models for Synthetic-to-Real Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16360v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence, unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems for challenging real-world applications.

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the right-skewed asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix; v2: slight improvement in presentation.

| **[VP Lab: a PEFT-Enabled Visual Prompting Laboratory for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15592v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pretrained vision backbones have transformed computer vision by providing powerful feature extractors that enable various downstream tasks, including training-free approaches like visual prompting for semantic segmentation. Despite their success in generic scenarios, these models often fall short when applied to specialized technical domains where the visual features differ significantly from their training distribution. To bridge this gap, we introduce VP Lab, a comprehensive iterative framework that enhances visual prompting for robust segmentation model development. At the core of VP Lab lies E-PEFT, a novel ensemble of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques specifically designed to adapt our visual prompting pipeline to specific domains in a manner that is both parameter- and data-efficient. Our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for the Segment Anything Model (SAM), but also facilitates an interactive, near-real-time loop, allowing users to observe progressively improving results as they experiment within the framework. By integrating E-PEFT with visual prompting, we demonstrate a remarkable 50\% increase in semantic segmentation mIoU performance across various technical datasets using only 5 validated images, establishing a new paradigm for fast, efficient, and interactive model deployment in new, challenging domains. This work comes in the form of a demonstration.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLIMB-3D: Continual Learning for Imbalanced 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17429v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, existing methods typically assume that all object classes are known in advance and are uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches have addressed class emergence, they often overlook class imbalance, resulting in suboptimal performance -- particularly on rare categories. To tackle this challenge, we propose CLIMB-3D, a unified framework for \textbf{CL}ass-incremental \textbf{Imb}alance-aware \textbf{3D}IS. Building upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust performance under constrained memory conditions. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen prior model. Despite its promise, PLG tends to bias towards frequent classes. Therefore, we propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme, that estimates object frequencies from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias -- without requiring access to past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, and additionally on semantic segmentation on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by up to 16.76\% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30\% mIoU for semantic segmentation, demonstrating strong generalization across both frequent and rare classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D) |

We propose a novel multi-view projection framework that excels in both domain generalization (DG) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our approach first aligns Lidar scans into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to create a large-scale synthetic 2D dataset (PC2D). We then use it to train a 2D segmentation model in-domain. During inference, the model processes hundreds of views per scene; the resulting logits are back-projected to 3D with an occlusion-aware voting scheme to generate final point-wise labels. Our framework is modular and enables extensive exploration of key design parameters, such as view generation optimization (VGO), visualization modality optimization (MODO), and 2D model choice. We evaluate on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets under both the DG and UDA settings. We achieve state-of-the-art results in UDA and close to state-of-the-art in DG, with particularly large gains on large, static classes.

To address this, integrating additional thermal radiation data with RGB images demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness. However, how to effectively reconcile the modality discrepancies and fuse the RGB and thermal features remains a well-known challenge. In this work, we address this challenge from a novel spectral perspective. We observe that the multi-modal features can be categorized into two spectral components: low-frequency features that provide broad scene context, including color variations and smooth areas, and high-frequency features that capture modality-specific details such as edges and textures. Inspired by this, we propose the Spectral-aware Global Fusion Network (SGFNet) to effectively enhance and fuse the multi-modal features by explicitly modeling the interactions between the high-frequency, modality-specific features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the MFNet and PST900 datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent.

To address this challenge, we propose a context-aware approach that integrates Bidirectional Latent Information Propagation (BLIP) for content extraction from source images. By matching extracted content information with category information, our method ensures cohesive integration of target objects using Segment Anything Model (SAM) and You Only Look Once (YOLO). This approach eliminates the need for manual annotation, offering an automated and user-friendly solution.

Semantic segmentation (SS) of RSIs enables the fine-grained interpretation of surface features, making it a critical task in remote sensing analysis. With the increasing diversity and volume of RSIs collected by sensors on various platforms, traditional processing methods struggle to maintain efficiency and accuracy. In response, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling substantial advances in remote sensing image semantic segmentation (RSISS) by automating feature extraction and improving segmentation accuracy across diverse modalities. This paper revisits the evolution of DL-based RSISS by categorizing existing approaches into four stages: the early pixel-based methods, the prevailing patch-based and tile-based techniques, and the emerging image-based strategies enabled by foundation models. We analyze these developments from the perspective of feature extraction and learning strategies, revealing the field's progression from pixel-level to tile-level and from unimodal to multimodal segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nearly 40 advanced techniques on a unified dataset to quantitatively characterize their performance and applicability. This review offers a holistic view of DL-based SS for RS, highlighting key advancements, comparative insights, and open challenges to guide future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables</p></details> | None |

The calibration in fusion between sensors such as LiDAR and camera is always supposed to be precise in previous work. However, in reality, calibration matrices are fixed when the vehicles leave the factory, but vibration, bumps, and data lags may cause calibration bias. As the research on the calibration influence on fusion detection performance is relatively few, flexible calibration dependency multi-sensor detection method has always been attractive. In this paper, we conducted experiments on SOTA detection method EPNet++ and proved slight bias on calibration can reduce the performance seriously. We also proposed a re-calibration model based on semantic segmentation which can be combined with a detection algorithm to improve the performance and robustness of multi-modal calibration bias.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |

This study focuses on assessing the potential of LiDAR data for accurate 3D building reconstruction at LOD1 and extracting morphological features from these models. Four deep semantic segmentation models, U-Net, Attention U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepLabV3+, were used, applying transfer learning to extract building footprints from LiDAR data. The results showed that U-Net3+ and Attention U-Net outperformed the others, achieving IoU scores of 0.833 and 0.814, respectively. Various statistical measures, including maximum, range, mode, median, and the 90th percentile, were used to estimate building heights, resulting in the generation of 3D models at LOD1. As the main contribution of the research, the impact of segmentation accuracy on the quality of 3D building modeling and the accuracy of morphological features like building area and external wall surface area was investigated. The results showed that the accuracy of building identification (segmentation performance) significantly affects the 3D model quality and the estimation of morphological features, depending on the height calculation method.

One area of improvement which has been highlighted by SGPN's authors, pertains to use of memory intensive similarity matrices which occupy memory quadratic in the number of points. In this report, we attempt to tackle this issue through use of two sampling based methods, which compute Instance Segmentation on a sub-sampled Point Set, and then extrapolate labels to the complete set using the nearest neigbhour approach. While both approaches perform equally well on large sub-samples, the random-based strategy gives the most improvements in terms of speed and memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 11 figures, paper dated 2019</p></details> | None |

At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting, inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on the classification corruption benchmarks, including ImageNet-C and CIFAR-10/100-C, as well as the Cityscapes$\rightarrow$ACDC semantic segmentation task, covering recurring and continuously evolving domain shifts, demonstrate that ReservoirTTA significantly improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Intra-class Patch Swap for Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14124v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a valuable technique for compressing large deep learning models into smaller, edge-suitable networks. However, conventional KD frameworks rely on pre-trained high-capacity teacher networks, which introduce significant challenges such as increased memory/storage requirements, additional training costs, and ambiguity in selecting an appropriate teacher for a given student model. Although a teacher-free distillation (self-distillation) has emerged as a promising alternative, many existing approaches still rely on architectural modifications or complex training procedures, which limit their generality and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on teacher-free distillation that operates using a single student network without any auxiliary components, architectural modifications, or additional learnable parameters. Our approach is built on a simple yet highly effective augmentation, called intra-class patch swap augmentation. This augmentation simulates a teacher-student dynamic within a single model by generating pairs of intra-class samples with varying confidence levels, and then applying instance-to-instance distillation to align their predictive distributions. Our method is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement, requiring only a single augmentation function. Extensive experiments across image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection show that our method consistently outperforms both existing self-distillation baselines and conventional teacher-based KD approaches. These results suggest that the success of self-distillation could hinge on the design of the augmentation itself.

Spectral shift, which emerges from disparities in sensors and geospatial conditions, poses a significant challenge in this domain. Existing methods predominantly rely on domain adaptation and generalization strategies, often utilizing small-scale models that exhibit limited performance. In contrast, Land-MoE addresses these issues by hierarchically inserting a Frequency-aware Mixture of Low-rank Token Experts, to fine-tune Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, Land-MoE comprises two key modules: the mixture of low-rank token experts (MoLTE) and frequency-aware filters (FAF). MoLTE leverages rank-differentiated tokens to generate diverse feature adjustments for individual instances within multispectral images. By dynamically combining learnable low-rank token experts of varying ranks, it enhances the robustness against spectral shifts. Meanwhile, FAF conducts frequency-domain modulation on the refined features. This process enables the model to effectively capture frequency band information that is strongly correlated with semantic essence, while simultaneously suppressing frequency noise irrelevant to the task. Comprehensive experiments on MLCC tasks involving cross-sensor and cross-geospatial setups demonstrate that Land-MoE outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Additionally, the proposed approach has also achieved state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization semantic segmentation tasks of RGB remote sensing images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaling Vision Mamba Across Resolutions via Fractal Traversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14062v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Mamba has recently emerged as a promising alternative to Transformer-based architectures, offering linear complexity in sequence length while maintaining strong modeling capacity. However, its adaptation to visual inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse. Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments on image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change detection demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous Mamba-based backbones, particularly under high-resolution settings.</p></details> | Work in progressing | None |

However, while most methods aim to improve accuracy, their computational efficiency remains underexplored. To address this, we propose EGFormer, an efficient multimodal semantic segmentation framework that flexibly integrates an arbitrary number of modalities while significantly reducing model parameters and inference time without sacrificing performance. Our framework introduces two novel modules. First, the Any-modal Scoring Module (ASM) assigns importance scores to each modality independently, enabling dynamic ranking based on their feature maps. Second, the Modal Dropping Module (MDM) filters out less informative modalities at each stage, selectively preserving and aggregating only the most valuable features. This design allows the model to leverage useful information from all available modalities while discarding redundancy, thus ensuring high segmentation quality. In addition to efficiency, we evaluate EGFormer on a synthetic-to-real transfer task to demonstrate its generalizability. Extensive experiments show that EGFormer achieves competitive performance with up to 88 percent reduction in parameters and 50 percent fewer GFLOPs. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, it further achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In the context of industrial image inspection, conventional semantic segmentation models fail to maintain the segmentation consistency of fixed components across varying contextual environments due to a lack of perception of object contours. Given the real-time constraints and limited computing capability of industrial image detection machines, it is also necessary to create efficient models to reduce computational complexity. In this work, a Shape-Aware Efficient Network (SPENet) is proposed, which focuses on the shapes of objects to achieve excellent segmentation consistency by separately supervising the extraction of boundary and body information from images. In SPENet, a novel method is introduced for describing fuzzy boundaries to better adapt to real-world scenarios named Variable Boundary Domain (VBD). Additionally, a new metric, Consistency Mean Square Error(CMSE), is proposed to measure segmentation consistency for fixed components. Our approach attains the best segmentation accuracy and competitive speed on our dataset, showcasing significant advantages in CMSE among numerous state-of-the-art real-time segmentation networks, achieving a reduction of over 50% compared to the previously top-performing models.</p></details> |  | None |

Such data curation is labor-intensive and imposes significant overhead regarding time and costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL) partially overcomes these limitations by exploiting vast amounts of unlabeled data and creating surrogate (pretext or proxy) tasks to learn useful representations without manual labeling. As a result, SSL has become a powerful machine learning (ML) paradigm for solving several practical downstream computer vision problems, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. Image segmentation is the cornerstone of many high-level visual perception applications, including medical imaging, intelligent transportation, agriculture, and surveillance. Although there is substantial research potential for developing advanced algorithms for SSL-based semantic segmentation, a comprehensive study of existing methodologies is essential to trace advances and guide emerging researchers. This survey thoroughly investigates over 150 recent image segmentation articles, particularly focusing on SSL. It provides a practical categorization of pretext tasks, downstream tasks, and commonly used benchmark datasets for image segmentation research. It concludes with key observations distilled from a large body of literature and offers future directions to make this research field more accessible and comprehensible for readers.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 19 figures, to be submitted for a possible IEEE publication</p></details> | None |

To address this, we propose a two-stage framework called RobustSeg, which enhances multi-modal robustness through two key components: the Hybrid Prototype Distillation Module (HPDM) and the Representation Regularization Module (RRM). In the first stage, RobustSeg pre-trains a multi-modal teacher model using complete modalities. In the second stage, a student model is trained with random modality dropout while learning from the teacher via HPDM and RRM. HPDM transforms features into compact prototypes, enabling cross-modal hybrid knowledge distillation and mitigating bias from missing modalities. RRM reduces representation discrepancies between the teacher and student by optimizing functional entropy through the log-Sobolev inequality. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that RobustSeg outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of +2.76%, +4.56%, and +0.98%, respectively.

To tackle the problem of the neglect of inter-feature relationships, high-frequency information loss, and the limited attention to downstream tasks, this paper focuses on how to model correlation-driven decomposing features and reason high-level graph representation by efficiently extracting complementary information and aggregating multi-guided features. We propose a three-branch encoder-decoder architecture along with corresponding fusion layers as the fusion strategy. Firstly, shallow features from individual modalities are extracted by a depthwise convolution layer combined with the transformer block. In the three parallel branches of the encoder, Cross Attention and Invertible Block (CAI) extracts local features and preserves high-frequency texture details. Base Feature Extraction Module (BFE) captures long-range dependencies and enhances modality-shared information. Graph Reasoning Module (GR) is introduced to reason high-level cross-modality relations and simultaneously extract low-level detail features as CAI's modality-specific complementary information. Experiments demonstrate the competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods in visible/infrared image fusion and medical image fusion tasks. Moreover, the proposed algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of subsequent tasks, averagely scoring 8.27% mAP@0.5 higher in object detection and 5.85% mIoU higher in semantic segmentation.

While current approaches typically distill 3D semantic features from 2D foundational models (e.g., CLIP and SAM) to facilitate novel view segmentation and semantic understanding, their heavy reliance on 2D supervision can undermine cross-view semantic consistency and necessitate complex data preparation processes, therefore hindering view-consistent scene understanding. In this work, we present FreeGS, an unsupervised semantic-embedded 3DGS framework that achieves view-consistent 3D scene understanding without the need for 2D labels. Instead of directly learning semantic features, we introduce the IDentity-coupled Semantic Field (IDSF) into 3DGS, which captures both semantic representations and view-consistent instance indices for each Gaussian. We optimize IDSF with a two-step alternating strategy: semantics help to extract coherent instances in 3D space, while the resulting instances regularize the injection of stable semantics from 2D space. Additionally, we adopt a 2D-3D joint contrastive loss to enhance the complementarity between view-consistent 3D geometry and rich semantics during the bootstrapping process, enabling FreeGS to uniformly perform tasks such as novel-view semantic segmentation, object selection, and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on LERF-Mask, 3D-OVS, and ScanNet datasets demonstrate that FreeGS performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods while avoiding the complex data preprocessing workload.

Remote sensing imagery exhibits substantial variability across temporal, spectral, and spatial (TSS) dimensions, complicating unified data processing. Current deep learning models for dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and change detection, are typically tailored to specific input-output configurations. Consequently, variations in data dimensionality or task requirements often lead to significant performance degradation or model incompatibility, necessitating costly retraining or fine-tuning efforts for different application scenarios. This paper introduces the Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Network (TSSUN), a novel architecture designed for unified representation and modeling of remote sensing data across diverse TSS characteristics and task types. TSSUN employs a Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Strategy that leverages meta-information to decouple and standardize input representations from varied temporal, spectral, and spatial configurations, and similarly unifies output structures for different dense prediction tasks and class numbers. Furthermore, a Local-Global Window Attention mechanism is proposed to efficiently capture both local contextual details and global dependencies, enhancing the model's adaptability and feature extraction capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that a single TSSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and unifies various dense prediction tasks. The proposed approach consistently achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications without requiring task-specific modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, Code link:https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN) |

Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text embeddings, even after extensive alignment during training. Additionally, relying solely on deep text-aligned features limits shallow-level feature guidance, which is crucial for detecting small objects and fine details, ultimately reducing segmentation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a dual prompting framework, DPSeg, for this task. Our approach combines dual-prompt cost volume generation, a cost volume-guided decoder, and a semantic-guided prompt refinement strategy that leverages our dual prompting scheme to mitigate alignment issues in visual prompt generation. By incorporating visual embeddings from a visual prompt encoder, our approach reduces the domain gap between text and image embeddings while providing multi-level guidance through shallow features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | None |
| **[Disentangling CLIP for Multi-Object Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02977v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models like CLIP excel at recognizing the single, prominent object in a scene. However, they struggle in complex scenes containing multiple objects. We identify a fundamental reason behind this limitation: VLMs features space exhibits significant semantic entanglement, where features of one class contain substantial information about other unrelated classes, a phenomenon we term mutual feature information (MFI). This entanglement becomes evident during class-specific queries, as unrelated objects are activated alongside the queried class. To address this limitation, we propose DCLIP, a framework that disentangles CLIP features using two complementary objectives: a novel MFI Loss that orthogonalizes the text (class) features to reduce inter-class similarity, and the Asymmetric Loss (ASL) that aligns image features with the disentangled text features. Our experiment demonstrates that DCLIP reduces inter-class feature similarity by 30\% compared to CLIP, leading to significant performance gains on multi-label recognition (MLR) and zero-shot semantic segmentation (ZS3). In MLR, DCLIP outperforms SOTA approaches on VOC2007 and COCO-14 while using 75\% fewer parameters, and surpasses SOTA ZS3 methods by 3.4 mIoU on VOC2012 and 2.8 mIoU on COCO-17. These results establish feature disentanglement as a critical factor for effective multi-object perception in vision-language models.</p></details> |  | None |

While class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is crucial for handling diverse and newly emerging objects in the real world, traditional CISS methods require expensive pixel-level annotations for training. To overcome this limitation, partially weakly-supervised approaches have recently been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a completely weakly-supervised method for CISS. To achieve this, we propose to generate robust pseudo-labels by combining pseudo-labels from a localizer and a sequence of foundation models based on their uncertainty. Moreover, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce an exemplar-guided data augmentation method that generates diverse images containing both previous and novel classes with guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments in three common experimental settings: 15-5 VOC, 10-10 VOC, and COCO-to-VOC, and in two scenarios: disjoint and overlap. The experimental results demonstrate that our completely weakly supervised method outperforms even partially weakly supervised methods in the 15-5 VOC and 10-10 VOC settings while achieving competitive accuracy in the COCO-to-VOC setting.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Moreover, as far as we are aware, there are no public annotated datasets generated through Structure From Motion (SfM) algorithms applied to imagery, which may be due to the lack of SfM algorithms that can map semantic segmentation information into an accurate point cloud, especially in a challenging environment like forests. In this work, we present a novel pipeline for generating semantically segmented point clouds of forest environments. Using a custom-built forest simulator, we generate realistic RGB images of diverse forest scenes along with their corresponding semantic segmentation masks. These labeled images are then processed using modified open-source SfM software capable of preserving semantic information during 3D reconstruction. The resulting point clouds provide both geometric and semantic detail, offering a valuable resource for training and evaluating deep learning models aimed at segmenting real forest point clouds obtained via SfM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress, accepted in Novel Approaches for Precision Agriculture and Forestry with Autonomous Robots, ICRA 2025 Workshop - May 23, 2025 - Atlanta, GA</p></details> | None |

However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer, featuring linear temporal complexity $\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention. Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking, and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with over 15\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency gains, achieving $\times 16$, $\times 10$ and $\times 5$ improvements on the three tasks. https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer) |

In real-world applications, models are typically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the environment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in model performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by adapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains. Despite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing challenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To tackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for ALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer selection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select low-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we propose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on entropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing model stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation mechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers with those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation and source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we construct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA benchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU improvements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference. The new benchmarks and code are available at https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA.</p></details> | 18 pages,12 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA) |

However, existing research commonly overlooks the fine-grained class relationships within the semantic space when addressing heterogeneous problems, particularly domain shift. This oversight results in ambiguities between class representation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel federated segmentation framework that strikes class consistency, termed FedSaaS. Specifically, we introduce class exemplars as a criterion for both local- and global-level class representations. On the server side, the uploaded class exemplars are leveraged to model class prototypes, which supervise global branch of clients, ensuring alignment with global-level representation. On the client side, we incorporate an adversarial mechanism to harmonize contributions of global and local branches, leading to consistent output. Moreover, multilevel contrastive losses are employed on both sides to enforce consistency between two-level representations in the same semantic space. Extensive experiments on several driving scene segmentation datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving average segmentation accuracy and effectively addressing the class-consistency representation problem.</p></details> |  | None |

However, visual representations are inherently independent of language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal visual anomaly segmentation. We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images, we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot, and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods.

Inadequate illumination can lead to significant information loss and poor image quality, impacting various applications such as surveillance. photography, or even autonomous driving. In this regard, automated methods have been developed to automatically adjust illumination in the image for a better visual perception. Current enhancement techniques often use specific datasets to enhance low-light images, but still present challenges when adapting to diverse real-world conditions, where illumination degradation may be localized to specific regions. To address this challenge, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, whose main approach is the use of a classification mechanism to determine whether local or global illumination enhancement is required. Subsequently, estimator networks adjust illumination based on this classification and simultaneously enhance color fidelity. ALEN integrates the Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization, complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet), and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise estimation of illumination and color, respectively. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for low-light conditions were carried out to underscore ALEN's robust generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The ALEN not only enhances image quality in terms of visual perception but also represents an advancement in high-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, as presented in this work.

MESSI is unique in two main features. First, it contains images from various altitudes, allowing us to investigate the effect of depth on semantic segmentation. Second, it includes images taken from several different urban regions (at different altitudes). This is important since the variety covers the visual richness captured by a drone's 3D flight, performing horizontal and vertical maneuvers. MESSI contains images annotated with location, orientation, and the camera's intrinsic parameters and can be used to train a deep neural network for semantic segmentation or other applications of interest (e.g., localization, navigation, and tracking). This paper describes the dataset and provides annotation details. It also explains how semantic segmentation was performed using several neural network models and shows several relevant statistics. MESSI will be published in the public domain to serve as an evaluation benchmark for semantic segmentation using images captured by a drone or similar vehicle flying over a dense urban environment.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and super-resolution, conventional upsampling operators cannot accommodate the slenderness of tubular structures and the curvature of morphology. This paper introduces a dynamic snake upsampling operators and a boundary-skeleton weighted loss tailored for topological tubular structures. Specifically, we design a snake upsampling operators based on an adaptive sampling domain, which dynamically adjusts the sampling stride according to the feature map and selects a set of subpixel sampling points along the serpentine path, enabling more accurate subpixel-level feature recovery for tubular structures. Meanwhile, we propose a skeleton-to-boundary increasing weighted loss that trades off main body and boundary weight allocation based on mask class ratio and distance field, preserving main body overlap while enhancing focus on target topological continuity and boundary alignment precision. Experiments across various domain datasets and backbone networks show that this plug-and-play dynamic snake upsampling operator and boundary-skeleton weighted loss boost both pixel-wise segmentation accuracy and topological consistency of results.</p></details> |  | None |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these gaps by coupling generation with external search. We analyse how hyperparameters influence speed and quality in RAG systems, covering Chroma and Faiss vector stores, chunking policies, cross-encoder re-ranking, and temperature, and we evaluate six metrics: faithfulness, answer correctness, answer relevancy, context precision, context recall, and answer similarity. Chroma processes queries 13% faster, whereas Faiss yields higher retrieval precision, revealing a clear speed-accuracy trade-off. Naive fixed-length chunking with small windows and minimal overlap outperforms semantic segmentation while remaining the quickest option. Re-ranking provides modest gains in retrieval quality yet increases runtime by roughly a factor of 5, so its usefulness depends on latency constraints. These results help practitioners balance computational cost and accuracy when tuning RAG systems for transparent, up-to-date responses. Finally, we re-evaluate the top configurations with a corrective RAG workflow and show that their advantages persist when the model can iteratively request additional evidence. We obtain a near-perfect context precision (99%), which demonstrates that RAG systems can achieve extremely high retrieval accuracy with the right combination of hyperparameters, with significant implications for applications where retrieval quality directly impacts downstream task performance, such as clinical decision support in healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods for assessing these characteristics typically rely on cell proxy tasks and require additional post-processing steps. In this work, We focus on a novel task-TLS Semantic Segmentation (TLS-SS)-which segments both the regions and maturation stages of TLS in WSI in an end-to-end manner. Due to the extensive scale of WSI and patch-based segmentation strategies, TLS-SS necessitates integrating from neighboring patches to guide target patch (target) segmentation. Previous techniques often employ on multi-resolution approaches, constraining the capacity to leverage the broader neighboring context while tend to preserve coarse-grained information. To address this, we propose a GNN-based Neighboring Context Aggregation Framework (GNCAF), which progressively aggregates multi-hop neighboring context from the target and employs a self-attention mechanism to guide the segmentation of the target. GNCAF can be integrated with various segmentation models to enhance their ability to perceive contextual information outside of the patch. We build two TLS-SS datasets, called TCGA-COAD and INHOUSE-PAAD, and make the former (comprising 225 WSIs and 5041 TLSs) publicly available. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNCAF, achieving a maximum of 22.08% and 26.57% improvement in mF1 and mIoU, respectively. Additionally, we also validate the task scalability of GNCAF on segmentation of lymph node metastases.</p></details> |  | None |

This is crucial in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, which depend on rapid and precise semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds for real-time 3D scene understanding. In this work, we introduce a sampling-free approach for estimating well-calibrated confidence values for classification tasks, achieving alignment with true classification accuracy and significantly reducing inference time compared to sampling-based methods. Our evaluation using the Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) metric for LiDAR semantic segmentation shows that our approach maintains well-calibrated confidence values while achieving increased processing speed compared to a sampling baseline. Additionally, reliability diagrams reveal that our method produces underconfidence rather than overconfident predictions, an advantage for safety-critical applications.

In this work, we propose a complementary boundary and context distillation (BCD) method within the KD framework for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted knowledge transfer from large accurate teacher models to compact efficient student models. Specifically, the boundary distillation component focuses on extracting explicit object-level semantic boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps of the backbone network to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Concurrently, the context distillation component leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions. Our proposed BCD method is specifically designed for EDIP tasks and is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Extensive experimental results across semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on various representative datasets demonstrate that our method can outperform existing methods without requiring extra supervisions or incurring increased inference costs, resulting in well-defined object boundaries and smooth connecting regions.</p></details> | under submission | None |

The results show that depth images are broadly viewed as privacy-safe, and a similarly high proportion of respondents feel the same about semantic segmentation images. Additionally, the majority of participants consider 32*32 resolution RGB images to be almost sufficiently privacy-preserving, while most believe that 16*16 resolution can fully guarantee privacy protection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feedback-Driven Pseudo-Label Reliability Assessment: Redefining Thresholding for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07691v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled data to enhance model performance, addressing the limitations of fully supervised approaches. Among its strategies, pseudo-supervision has proven highly effective, typically relying on one or multiple teacher networks to refine pseudo-labels before training a student network. A common practice in pseudo-supervision is filtering pseudo-labels based on pre-defined confidence thresholds or entropy. However, selecting optimal thresholds requires large labeled datasets, which are often scarce in real-world semi-supervised scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose Ensemble-of-Confidence Reinforcement (ENCORE), a dynamic feedback-driven thresholding strategy for pseudo-label selection. Instead of relying on static confidence thresholds, ENCORE estimates class-wise true-positive confidence within the unlabeled dataset and continuously adjusts thresholds based on the model's response to different levels of pseudo-label filtering. This feedback-driven mechanism ensures the retention of informative pseudo-labels while filtering unreliable ones, enhancing model training without manual threshold tuning. Our method seamlessly integrates into existing pseudo-supervision frameworks and significantly improves segmentation performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating ENCORE with existing pseudo-supervision frameworks enhances performance across multiple datasets and network architectures, validating its effectiveness in semi-supervised learning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 Figures | None |

Creating UDTs involves challenges at multiple process stages, including acquiring accurate 3D source data, reconstructing high-fidelity 3D models, maintaining models' updates, and ensuring seamless interoperability to downstream tasks.

Recent advancements have introduced deterministic sampling processes that reduce inference from 15 iterative steps to a single step, thereby significantly improving the inference speed of existing diffusion models. However, their efficiency remains limited when handling complex semantic regions due to the single-step inference. To address this limitation, we propose SAMSR, a semantic-guided diffusion framework that incorporates semantic segmentation masks into the sampling process. Specifically, we introduce the SAM-Noise Module, which refines Gaussian noise using segmentation masks to preserve spatial and semantic features. Furthermore, we develop a pixel-wise sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the residual transfer rate and noise strength based on pixel-level semantic weights, prioritizing semantically rich regions during the diffusion process. To enhance model training, we also propose a semantic consistency loss, which aligns pixel-wise semantic weights between predictions and ground truth. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SAMSR significantly improves perceptual quality and detail recovery, particularly in semantically complex images.

Fortunately, Domain Generalization (DG) excels without the need for any target data. Recent works expose that depth maps contribute to improved generalized performance in the UDA tasks, but they ignore the noise and holes in depth maps due to device and environmental factors, failing to sufficiently and effectively learn domain-invariant representation. Although high-sensitivity region suppression has shown promising results in learning domain-invariant features, existing methods cannot be directly applicable to depth maps due to their unique characteristics. Hence, we propose a novel framework, namely Depth-Sensitive Soft Suppression with RGB-D inter-modal stylization flow (DSSS), focusing on learning domain-invariant features from depth maps for the DG semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose the RGB-D inter-modal stylization flow to generate stylized depth maps for sensitivity detection, cleverly utilizing RGB information as the stylization source. Then, a class-wise soft spatial sensitivity suppression is designed to identify and emphasize non-sensitive depth features that contain more domain-invariant information. Furthermore, an RGB-D soft alignment loss is proposed to ensure that the stylized depth maps only align part of the RGB features while still retaining the unique depth information. To our best knowledge, our DSSS framework is the first work to integrate RGB and Depth information in the multi-class DG semantic segmentation task. Extensive experiments over multiple backbone networks show that our framework achieves remarkable performance improvement.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for thermal image segmentation can be an efficient solution to address the lack of labeled thermal datasets. Nevertheless, since these methods do not effectively utilize the complementary information between RGB and thermal images, they significantly decrease performance during domain adaptation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on cross-spectral UDA for thermal image semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel masked mutual learning strategy that promotes complementary information exchange by selectively transferring results between each spectral model while masking out uncertain regions. Additionally, we introduce a novel prototypical self-supervised loss designed to enhance the performance of the thermal segmentation model in nighttime scenarios. This approach addresses the limitations of RGB pre-trained networks, which cannot effectively transfer knowledge under low illumination due to the inherent constraints of RGB sensors. In experiments, our method achieves higher performance over previous UDA methods and comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Robotics and Automation(ICRA) 2025</p></details> | None |

Controllable Generative models offer data augmentation methods for semantic segmentation tasks by using prompts and visual references from the original image. However, these models face challenges in generating synthetic images that accurately reflect the content and structure of the original image due to difficulties in creating effective prompts and visual references. In this work, we introduce an effective data augmentation pipeline for semantic segmentation using Controllable Diffusion model. Our proposed method includes efficient prompt generation using \textit{Class-Prompt Appending} and \textit{Visual Prior Blending} to enhance attention to labeled classes in real images, allowing the pipeline to generate a precise number of augmented images while preserving the structure of segmentation-labeled classes. In addition, we implement a \textit{class balancing algorithm} to ensure a balanced training dataset when merging the synthetic and original images. Evaluation on PASCAL VOC datasets, our pipeline demonstrates its effectiveness in generating high-quality synthetic images for semantic segmentation.

| **[Reducing Unimodal Bias in Multi-Modal Semantic Segmentation with Multi-Scale Functional Entropy Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06635v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fusing and balancing multi-modal inputs from novel sensors for dense prediction tasks, particularly semantic segmentation, is critically important yet remains a significant challenge. One major limitation is the tendency of multi-modal frameworks to over-rely on easily learnable modalities, a phenomenon referred to as unimodal dominance or bias. This issue becomes especially problematic in real-world scenarios where the dominant modality may be unavailable, resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we apply a simple but effective plug-and-play regularization term based on functional entropy, which introduces no additional parameters or modules. This term is designed to intuitively balance the contribution of each visual modality to the segmentation results. Specifically, we leverage the log-Sobolev inequality to bound functional entropy using functional-Fisher-information. By maximizing the information contributed by each visual modality, our approach mitigates unimodal dominance and establishes a more balanced and robust segmentation framework. A multi-scale regularization module is proposed to apply our proposed plug-and-play term on high-level features and also segmentation predictions for more balanced multi-modal learning. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance, i.e., +13.94%, +3.25%, and +3.64%, without introducing any additional parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose RESAR-BEV, a progressive refinement framework that advances beyond single-step end-to-end approaches: (1) progressive refinement through residual autoregressive learning that decomposes BEV segmentation into interpretable coarse-to-fine stages via our Drive-Transformer and Modifier-Transformer residual prediction cascaded architecture, (2) robust BEV representation combining ground-proximity voxels with adaptive height offsets and dual-path voxel feature encoding (max+attention pooling) for efficient feature extraction, and (3) decoupled supervision with offline Ground Truth decomposition and online joint optimization to prevent overfitting while ensuring structural coherence. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate RESAR-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance with 54.0% mIoU across 7 essential driving-scene categories while maintaining real-time capability at 14.6 FPS. The framework exhibits robustness in challenging scenarios of long-range perception and adverse weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS) on 09-May-2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Improving Open-Set Semantic Segmentation in 3D Point Clouds by Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization: Preliminary Results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11521v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point-cloud semantic segmentation underpins a wide range of critical applications. Although recent deep architectures and large-scale datasets have driven impressive closed-set performance, these models struggle to recognize or properly segment objects outside their training classes. This gap has sparked interest in Open-Set Semantic Segmentation (O3S), where models must both correctly label known categories and detect novel, unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the segmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel regularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that maximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned on each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages the encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the network's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting unseen objects. We further outline future directions for dynamic open-world adaptation and efficient information-theoretic estimation.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[UncertainSAM: Fast and Efficient Uncertainty Quantification of the Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05049v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has paved the way for numerous semantic segmentation applications. For several tasks, quantifying the uncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of the class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated uncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation jointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task uncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ method. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised models, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic USAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k, DAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ alternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines, or balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML'25 | None |
| **[Split Matching for Inductive Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05023v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment categories that are not annotated during training. While fine-tuning vision-language models has achieved promising results, these models often overfit to seen categories due to the lack of supervision for unseen classes. As an alternative to fully supervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS, as it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However, conventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks, needs full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background in the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates). Specifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then conducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity and mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual multi-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial details across resolutions. SM is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Collecting diverse real-world data for testing the robustness of DL models is resource-intensive, making synthetic corruptions an attractive alternative for robustness testing. However, are synthetic corruptions a reliable proxy for real-world corruptions? To answer this, we conduct the largest benchmarking study on semantic segmentation models, comparing performance on real-world corruptions and synthetic corruptions datasets. Our results reveal a strong correlation in mean performance, supporting the use of synthetic corruptions for robustness evaluation. We further analyze corruption-specific correlations, providing key insights to understand when synthetic corruptions succeed in representing real-world corruptions.

We propose two key modules: Efficient-KAN (Eff-KAN), which replaces MLP layers with spline functions and Wavelet-KAN (Wav-KAN), leveraging orthogonal wavelet transforms for multi-resolution feature extraction. These modules are systematically integrated in ViT encoder layers and classification heads to enhance spatial-frequency modeling while mitigating computational bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K (Image Recognition), COCO (Object Detection and Instance Segmentation), and ADE20K (Semantic Segmentation) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with Hyb-KAN ViT. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of wavelet-driven spectral priors in segmentation and spline-based efficiency in detection tasks.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense prediction often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. The ``content'' features are aligned with image crop representations to improve local discriminability, while ``context'' features learn to retain the spatial correlations under the guidance of vision foundation models, such as DINO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation.

However, annotating LiDAR point clouds is extremely costly and requires assigning semantic labels to millions of points with complex geometric structures. Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce labeling costs by querying only the most informative samples. Yet, existing AL methods face critical challenges when applied to large-scale 3D data: outdoor scenes contain an overwhelming number of points and suffer from severe class imbalance, where rare classes have far fewer points than dominant classes. To address these issues, we propose SELECT, a voxel-centric submodular approach tailored for active LiDAR semantic segmentation. Our method targets both scalability problems and class imbalance through three coordinated stages. First, we perform Voxel-Level Submodular Subset Selection, which efficiently identifies representative voxels without pairwise comparisons, ensuring scalability. Second, we estimate Voxel-Level Model Uncertainty using Monte Carlo dropout, aggregating point-wise uncertainties to identify informative voxels. Finally, we introduce Submodular Maximization for Point-Level Class Balancing, which selects a subset of points that enhances label diversity, explicitly mitigating class imbalance. Experiments on SemanticPOSS, SemanticKITTI, and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SELECT achieves superior performance compared to prior active learning approaches for 3D semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

A Benchmark To Evaluate Visual and Textual Prompts in Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06280v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering has shown remarkable success with large language models, yet its systematic exploration in computer vision remains limited. In semantic segmentation, both textual and visual prompts offer distinct advantages: textual prompts through open-vocabulary methods allow segmentation of arbitrary categories, while visual reference prompts provide intuitive reference examples. However, existing benchmarks evaluate these modalities in isolation, without direct comparison under identical conditions. We present Show or Tell (SoT), a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate both visual and textual prompts for semantic segmentation across 14 datasets spanning 7 diverse domains (common scenes, urban, food, waste, parts, tools, and land-cover). We evaluate 5 open-vocabulary methods and 4 visual reference prompt approaches, adapting the latter to handle multi-class segmentation through a confidence-based mask merging strategy. Our extensive experiments reveal that open-vocabulary methods excel with common concepts easily described by text but struggle with complex domains like tools, while visual reference prompt methods achieve good average results but exhibit high variability depending on the input prompt. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of both prompting modalities, providing valuable insights to guide future research in vision foundation models for segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PixFoundation workshop at CVPR2025.

Although camera sensors provide rich visual details, they are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions. In contrast, radar sensors remain robust under such conditions, but often produce sparse and noisy data. Therefore, a promising approach is to fuse information from both sensors. In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance camera-only baselines by integrating a diffusion model into a camera-radar fusion architecture. We leverage radar point features to create pseudo-masks using the Segment-Anything model, treating the projected radar points as point prompts. Additionally, we propose a noise reduction unit to denoise these pseudo-masks, which are further used to generate inpainted images that complete the missing information in the original images. Our method improves the camera-only segmentation baseline by 2.63% in mIoU and enhances our camera-radar fusion architecture by 1.48% in mIoU on the Waterscenes dataset. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for semantic segmentation using camera-radar fusion under adverse weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RA-L 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object grounding with simple (bare) queries, but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene graph representation with metric and semantic spatial edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to construct 3D object-centric map and an advanced raycasting algorithm with a 2D vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On the Replica and ScanNet datasets, we have demonstrated that BBQ takes a leading place in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation compared to other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On challenging Sr3D+, Nr3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling objects grounding by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The combination of our design choices and software implementation has resulted in significant data processing speed in experiments on the robot on-board computer. This promising performance enables the application of our approach in intelligent robotics projects.

However, current panoramic semantic segmentation methods fail to identify outliers, and pinhole Out-of-distribution Segmentation (OoS) models perform unsatisfactorily in the panoramic domain due to background clutter and pixel distortions. To address these issues, we introduce a new task, Panoramic Out-of-distribution Segmentation (PanOoS), achieving OoS for panoramas. Furthermore, we propose the first solution, POS, which adapts to the characteristics of panoramic images through text-guided prompt distribution learning. Specifically, POS integrates a disentanglement strategy designed to materialize the cross-domain generalization capability of CLIP. The proposed Prompt-based Restoration Attention (PRA) optimizes semantic decoding by prompt guidance and self-adaptive correction, while Bilevel Prompt Distribution Learning (BPDL) refines the manifold of per-pixel mask embeddings via semantic prototype supervision. Besides, to compensate for the scarcity of PanOoS datasets, we establish two benchmarks: DenseOoS, which features diverse outliers in complex environments, and QuadOoS, captured by a quadruped robot with a panoramic annular lens system. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of POS, with AuPRC improving by 34.25% and FPR95 decreasing by 21.42% on DenseOoS, outperforming state-of-the-art pinhole-OoS methods.

We introduce a new 3D semantic segmentation pipeline that leverages aligned scenes and state-of-the-art 2D segmentation methods, avoiding the need for direct 3D annotation or reliance on additional modalities such as camera images at inference time. Our approach generates 2D views from LiDAR scans colored by sensor intensity and applies 2D semantic segmentation to these views using a camera-domain pretrained model. The segmented 2D outputs are then back-projected onto the 3D points, with a simple voting-based estimator that merges the labels associated to each 3D point. Our main contribution is a global pipeline for 3D semantic segmentation requiring no prior 3D annotation and not other modality for inference, which can be used for pseudo-label generation. We conduct a thorough ablation study and demonstrate the potential of the generated pseudo-labels for the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation task.</p></details> | Accepted to IV2024 | None |

However, current multi-modal scene understanding approaches have naively embedded semantic representations into 3D reconstruction methods without striking a balance between visual and language modalities, which leads to unsatisfying semantic rasterization of translucent or reflective objects, as well as over-fitting on color modality. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a solution that adequately handles the distinct visual and semantic modalities, i.e., a 3D vision-language Gaussian splatting model for scene understanding, to put emphasis on the representation learning of language modality. We propose a novel cross-modal rasterizer, using modality fusion along with a smoothed semantic indicator for enhancing semantic rasterization. We also employ a camera-view blending technique to improve semantic consistency between existing and synthesized views, thereby effectively mitigating over-fitting.

Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using supervised learning strategies, have shown considerable success for such tasks. However, CNN based architectures such as U-Net, often struggles to accurately identify platelets due to their sizes and high variability of features. To address these challenges, researchers have commonly employed strategies such as class weighted loss functions, which have demonstrated some success. However, this does not address the more significant challenge of platelet variability in size and tendency to form aggregates and associations with other blood components. In this study, we explored an alternative approach by investigating the role of convolutional kernels in mitigating these issues. We also assigned separate classes to singular platelets and platelet aggregates and performed semantic segmentation using various U-Net architectures for identifying platelets. We then evaluated and compared two common methods (pixel area method and connected component analysis) for counting platelets and proposed an alternative approach specialized for single platelets and platelet aggregates. Our experiments provided results that showed significant improvements in the identification of platelets, highlighting the importance of optimizing convolutional operations and class designations. We show that the common practice of pixel area-based counting often over estimate platelet counts, whereas the proposed method presented in this work offers significant improvements.

However, SAM is trained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for scene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low light and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes the powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash the potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T data pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original SAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong generalization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we introduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address cross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while maintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the minimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating the combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we enhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM and incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates multi-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted across three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900, and FMB.

However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15 issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies.

However, RGB-Event fusion faces three intrinsic misalignments: (i) temporal, (ii) spatial, and (iii) modal misalignment. Existing voxel grid representations neglect temporal correlations between consecutive event windows, and their formulation with simple accumulation of asynchronous and sparse events is incompatible with the synchronous and dense nature of RGB modality. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel event representation, Motion-enhanced Event Tensor (MET), which transforms sparse event voxels into a dense and temporally coherent form by leveraging dense optical flows and event temporal features. In addition, we introduce a Frequency-aware Bidirectional Flow Aggregation Module (BFAM) and a Temporal Fusion Module (TFM). BFAM leverages the frequency domain and MET to mitigate modal misalignment, while bidirectional flow aggregation and temporal fusion mechanisms resolve spatiotemporal misalignment. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-Event semantic segmentation approaches.

However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I have decided to withdraw this paper because I have recently obtained some new data and insights during my ongoing research</p></details> | None |

While existing attention-backed segmentation methods suffer from boundary instability and contextual discontinuities during feature mapping, our framework implements a higher-dimensional geometric smoothing method to establish a robust manifold relationships between visually coherent regions. GeloVec combines modified Chebyshev distance metrics with multispatial transformations to enhance segmentation accuracy through stabilized feature extraction. The core innovation lies in the adaptive sampling weights system that calculates geometric distances in n-dimensional feature space, achieving superior edge preservation while maintaining intra-class homogeneity. The multispatial transformation matrix incorporates tensorial projections with orthogonal basis vectors, creating more discriminative feature representations without sacrificing computational efficiency. Experimental validation across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates significant improvements in segmentation performance, with mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) gains of 2.1%, 2.7%, and 2.4% on Caltech Birds-200, LSDSC, and FSSD datasets respectively compared to state-of-the-art methods. GeloVec's mathematical foundation in Riemannian geometry provides theoretical guarantees on segmentation stability. Importantly, our framework maintains computational efficiency through parallelized implementation of geodesic transformations and exhibits strong generalization capabilities across disciplines due to the absence of information loss during transformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the recently proposed Mamba architecture, have emerged as a paradigm-shifting solution, combining linear computational scaling with global context modeling. This survey presents a comprehensive review of Mamba-based methodologies in remote sensing, systematically analyzing about 120 studies to construct a holistic taxonomy of innovations and applications. Our contributions are structured across five dimensions: (i) foundational principles of vision Mamba architectures, (ii) micro-architectural advancements such as adaptive scan strategies and hybrid SSM formulations, (iii) macro-architectural integrations, including CNN-Transformer-Mamba hybrids and frequency-domain adaptations, (iv) rigorous benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods in multiple application tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, change detection, etc. and (v) critical analysis of unresolved challenges with actionable future directions. By bridging the gap between SSM theory and remote sensing practice, this survey establishes Mamba as a transformative framework for remote sensing analysis. To our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review of Mamba architectures in remote sensing. Our work provides a structured foundation for advancing research in remote sensing systems through SSM-based methods.

Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation with geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without high-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain consistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have utilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view consensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that relies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's implicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry, enabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision. We propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF, initialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are corrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance disambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure globally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain highly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a balanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and semantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods and competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing them when using additional 3D point clouds.

This conclusion of Huellermeier et al. underpins the importance of calibrated uncertainties. Since AI-based algorithms are heavily impacted by dataset shifts, the automotive industry needs to safeguard its system against all possible contingencies. One important but often neglected dataset shift is caused by optical aberrations induced by the windshield. For the verification of the perception system performance, requirements on the AI performance need to be translated into optical metrics by a bijective mapping. Given this bijective mapping it is evident that the optical system characteristics add additional information about the magnitude of the dataset shift. As a consequence, we propose to incorporate a physical inductive bias into the neural network calibration architecture to enhance the robustness and the trustworthiness of the AI target application, which we demonstrate by using a semantic segmentation task as an example. By utilizing the Zernike coefficient vector of the optical system as a physical prior we can significantly reduce the mean expected calibration error in case of optical aberrations. As a result, we pave the way for a trustworthy uncertainty representation and for a holistic verification strategy of the perception chain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> | None |

However, many state-of-the-art methods are tested on outdated, lower-resolution LiDAR sensors and struggle with real-time constraints. This study introduces a novel semantic segmentation framework tailored for modern high-resolution LiDAR sensors that addresses both accuracy and real-time processing demands. We propose a novel LiDAR dataset collected by a cutting-edge automotive 128 layer LiDAR in urban traffic scenes. Furthermore, we propose a semantic segmentation method utilizing surface normals as strong input features. Our approach is bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical automotive applications.

| **[ClassWise-CRF: Category-Specific Fusion for Enhanced Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21491v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a result-level category-specific fusion architecture called ClassWise-CRF. This architecture employs a two-stage process: first, it selects expert networks that perform well in specific categories from a pool of candidate networks using a greedy algorithm; second, it integrates the segmentation predictions of these selected networks by adaptively weighting their contributions based on their segmentation performance in each category. Inspired by Conditional Random Field (CRF), the ClassWise-CRF architecture treats the segmentation predictions from multiple networks as confidence vector fields. It leverages segmentation metrics (such as Intersection over Union) from the validation set as priors and employs an exponential weighting strategy to fuse the category-specific confidence scores predicted by each network. This fusion method dynamically adjusts the weights of each network for different categories, achieving category-specific optimization. Building on this, the architecture further optimizes the fused results using unary and pairwise potentials in CRF to ensure spatial consistency and boundary accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of ClassWise-CRF, we conducted experiments on two remote sensing datasets, LoveDA and Vaihingen, using eight classic and advanced semantic segmentation networks. The results show that the ClassWise-CRF architecture significantly improves segmentation performance: on the LoveDA dataset, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric increased by 1.00% on the validation set and by 0.68% on the test set; on the Vaihingen dataset, the mIoU improved by 0.87% on the validation set and by 0.91% on the test set. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the ClassWise-CRF architecture in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.

| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PreCM: The Padding-based Rotation Equivariant Convolution Mode for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01624v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is an important branch of image processing and computer vision. With the popularity of deep learning, various convolutional neural networks have been proposed for pixel-level classification and segmentation tasks. In practical scenarios, however, imaging angles are often arbitrary, encompassing instances such as water body images from remote sensing and capillary and polyp images in the medical domain, where prior orientation information is typically unavailable to guide these networks to extract more effective features. In this case, learning features from objects with diverse orientation information poses a significant challenge, as the majority of CNN-based semantic segmentation networks lack rotation equivariance to resist the disturbance from orientation information. To address this challenge, this paper first constructs a universal convolution-group framework aimed at more fully utilizing orientation information and equipping the network with rotation equivariance. Subsequently, we mathematically design a padding-based rotation equivariant convolution mode (PreCM), which is not only applicable to multi-scale images and convolutional kernels but can also serve as a replacement component for various types of convolutions, such as dilated convolutions, transposed convolutions, and asymmetric convolution. To quantitatively assess the impact of image rotation in semantic segmentation tasks, we also propose a new evaluation metric, Rotation Difference (RD). The replacement experiments related to six existing semantic segmentation networks on three datasets show that, the average Intersection Over Union (IOU) of their PreCM-based versions respectively improve 6.91%, 10.63%, 4.53%, 5.93%, 7.48%, 8.33% compared to their original versions in terms of random angle rotation. And the average RD values are decreased by 3.58%, 4.56%, 3.47%, 3.66%, 3.47%, 3.43% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, submitted to TIP</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a general topological dynamics model to fold complex clothing. By utilizing the visible folding structure as the topological skeleton, we design a novel topological graph to represent the clothing state. This topological graph is low-dimensional and applied for complex clothing in various folding states. It indicates the constraints of clothing and enables predictions regarding clothing movement. To extract graphs from self-occlusion, we apply semantic segmentation to analyze the occlusion relationships and decompose the clothing structure. The decomposed structure is then combined with keypoint detection to generate the topological graph. To analyze the behavior of the topological graph, we employ an improved Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the general dynamics. The GNN model can predict the deformation of clothing and is employed to calculate the deformation Jacobi matrix for control. Experiments using jackets validate the algorithm's effectiveness to recognize and fold complex clothing with self-occlusion.</p></details> |  | None |

However, modern ConvNets remain confined to a pyramid structure that successively downsamples the feature map for receptive field expansion, neglecting this crucial biomimetic principle. We present OverLoCK, the first pure ConvNet backbone architecture that explicitly incorporates a top-down attention mechanism. Unlike pyramid backbone networks, our design features a branched architecture with three synergistic sub-networks: 1) a Base-Net that encodes low/mid-level features; 2) a lightweight Overview-Net that generates dynamic top-down attention through coarse global context modeling (i.e., overview first); and 3) a robust Focus-Net that performs finer-grained perception guided by top-down attention (i.e., look closely next). To fully unleash the power of top-down attention, we further propose a novel context-mixing dynamic convolution (ContMix) that effectively models long-range dependencies while preserving inherent local inductive biases even when the input resolution increases, addressing critical limitations in existing convolutions. Our OverLoCK exhibits a notable performance improvement over existing methods. For instance, OverLoCK-T achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 84.2%, significantly surpassing ConvNeXt-B while using only around one-third of the FLOPs/parameters. On object detection, our OverLoCK-S clearly surpasses MogaNet-B by 1% in AP^b. On semantic segmentation, our OverLoCK-T remarkably improves UniRepLKNet-T by 1.7% in mIoU.

Remote sensing surveys complement field-based approaches, and their reach can be especially great when combined with deep learning and computer vision techniques. However, conventional supervised deep learning methods face challenges in annotating fine-grained archaeological features at scale. While recent vision foundation models have shown remarkable success in learning large-scale remote sensing data with minimal annotations, most off-the-shelf solutions are designed for RGB images rather than multi-spectral satellite imagery, such as the 8-band data used in our study. In this paper, we introduce DeepAndes, a transformer-based vision foundation model trained on three million multi-spectral satellite images, specifically tailored for Andean archaeology. DeepAndes incorporates a customized DINOv2 self-supervised learning algorithm optimized for 8-band multi-spectral imagery, marking the first foundation model designed explicitly for the Andes region. We evaluate its image understanding performance through imbalanced image classification, image instance retrieval, and pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments show that DeepAndes achieves superior F1 scores, mean average precision, and Dice scores in few-shot learning scenarios, significantly outperforming models trained from scratch or pre-trained on smaller datasets. This underscores the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised pre-training in archaeological remote sensing.

The model selects real patches seen during training as prototypes and constructs the dense prediction map based on the similarity between parts of the test image and the prototypes. This improves interpretability since the user can inspect the link between the predicted output and the patterns learned by the model in terms of prototypical information. In this paper, we propose a method for interpretable semantic segmentation that leverages multi-scale image representation for prototypical part learning. First, we introduce a prototype layer that explicitly learns diverse prototypical parts at several scales, leading to multi-scale representations in the prototype activation output. Then, we propose a sparse grouping mechanism that produces multi-scale sparse groups of these scale-specific prototypical parts. This provides a deeper understanding of the interactions between multi-scale object representations while enhancing the interpretability of the segmentation model. The experiments conducted on Pascal VOC, Cityscapes, and ADE20K demonstrate that the proposed method increases model sparsity, improves interpretability over existing prototype-based methods, and narrows the performance gap with the non-interpretable counterpart models.

While previous efforts in UHR semantic segmentation have largely focused on multi-branch network architectures that emphasize multi-scale feature extraction and fusion, they have often overlooked the importance of addressing the long-tail issue. In contrast to prior UHR methods that focused on independent feature extraction, we emphasize data augmentation and multimodal feature fusion to alleviate the long-tail problem. In this paper, we introduce SRMF, a novel framework for semantic segmentation in UHR satellite imagery. Our approach addresses the long-tail class distribution by incorporating a multi-scale cropping technique alongside a data augmentation strategy based on semantic reordering and resampling. To further enhance model performance, we propose a multimodal fusion-based general representation knowledge injection method, which, for the first time, fuses text and visual features without the need for individual region text descriptions, extracting more robust features. Extensive experiments on the URUR, GID, and FBP datasets demonstrate that our method improves mIoU by 3.33\%, 0.66\%, and 0.98\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Current anomalous segmentation benchmarks predominantly focus on favorable weather conditions, resulting in untrustworthy evaluations that overlook the risks posed by diverse meteorological conditions in open-set environments, such as low illumination, dense fog, and heavy rain. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the ComsAmy, a challenging benchmark specifically designed for open-set anomaly segmentation in complex scenarios. ComsAmy encompasses a wide spectrum of adverse weather conditions, dynamic driving environments, and diverse anomaly types to comprehensively evaluate the model performance in realistic open-world scenarios. Our extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art anomalous segmentation models reveals that existing methods demonstrate significant deficiencies in such challenging scenarios, highlighting their serious safety risks for real-world deployment. To solve that, we propose a novel energy-entropy learning (EEL) strategy that integrates the complementary information from energy and entropy to bolster the robustness of anomaly segmentation under complex open-world environments. Additionally, a diffusion-based anomalous training data synthesizer is proposed to generate diverse and high-quality anomalous images to enhance the existing copy-paste training data synthesizer. Extensive experimental results on both public and ComsAmy benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed diffusion-based synthesizer with energy and entropy learning (DiffEEL) serves as an effective and generalizable plug-and-play method to enhance existing models, yielding an average improvement of around 4.96% in $\rm{AUPRC}$ and 9.87% in $\rm{FPR}_{95}$.</p></details> |  | None |

Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with only marginal performance degradation.</p></details> |  | None |

While previous work has considered distortions caused by ego motion, distortions caused by other moving objects remain largely overlooked, leading to errors in object shape and position. This distortion is particularly pronounced in high-speed environments such as highways and in multi-LiDAR configurations, a common setup for heavy vehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce HiMo, a pipeline that repurposes scene flow estimation for non-ego motion compensation, correcting the representation of dynamic objects in point clouds. During the development of HiMo, we observed that existing self-supervised scene flow estimators often produce degenerate or inconsistent estimates under high-speed distortion. We further propose SeFlow++, a real-time scene flow estimator that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scene flow and motion compensation. Since well-established motion distortion metrics are absent in the literature, we introduce two evaluation metrics: compensation accuracy at a point level and shape similarity of objects. We validate HiMo through extensive experiments on Argoverse 2, ZOD, and a newly collected real-world dataset featuring highway driving and multi-LiDAR-equipped heavy vehicles. Our findings show that HiMo improves the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of dynamic objects in LiDAR point clouds, benefiting downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation and 3D detection.

However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require numerous trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high-resolution representation CNNs efficiently by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features but also finds the proper location for placing the multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objectives (e.g., latency and mIoU) and is capable of finding architectures on the Pareto frontier with an arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of models via the Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searches for the best hybrid combination of light-weight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuses them to high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyCTAS outperforms previous methods in both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation tasks.

However, in the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic feature incorporation.

Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages,11 figures,5 tables</p></details> | None |

However, centralized deep learning (DL) approaches for semantic segmentation raise privacy and scalability challenges, particularly when handling sensitive data. This research presents a new federated learning (FL) framework that integrates secure deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Differential Privacy (DP) to address these issues. The core contribution of this work involves: (1) developing a new hybrid UNet-ResNet34 architecture for centralized semantic segmentation to achieve high accuracy and tackle privacy concerns due to centralized training, and (2) implementing the privacy-preserving FL model, distributed across AVs to enhance performance through secure CNNs and DP mechanisms. In the proposed FL framework, the methodology distinguishes itself from the existing approach through the following: (a) ensuring data decentralization through FL to uphold user privacy by eliminating the need for centralized data aggregation, (b) integrating DP mechanisms to secure sensitive model updates against potential adversarial inference attacks, and (c) evaluating the frameworks performance and generalizability using RGB and semantic segmentation datasets derived from the CARLA simulator. Experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy, from 81.5% to 88.7% for the RGB dataset and from 79.3% to 86.9% for the SEG dataset over 20 to 70 Communication Rounds (CRs). Global loss was reduced by over 60%, and minor accuracy trade-offs from DP were observed. This study contributes by offering a scalable, privacy-preserving FL framework tailored for AVs, optimizing communication efficiency while balancing performance and data security.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in Scientific Reports</p></details> | None |

| **[Multi-Grained Compositional Visual Clue Learning for Image Intent Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18201v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era where social media platforms abound, individuals frequently share images that offer insights into their intents and interests, impacting individual life quality and societal stability. Traditional computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation, focus on concrete visual representations, while intent recognition relies more on implicit visual clues. This poses challenges due to the wide variation and subjectivity of such clues, compounded by the problem of intra-class variety in conveying abstract concepts, e.g. "enjoy life". Existing methods seek to solve the problem by manually designing representative features or building prototypes for each class from global features. However, these methods still struggle to deal with the large visual diversity of each intent category. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach named Multi-grained Compositional visual Clue Learning (MCCL) to address these challenges for image intent recognition. Our method leverages the systematic compositionality of human cognition by breaking down intent recognition into visual clue composition and integrating multi-grained features. We adopt class-specific prototypes to alleviate data imbalance. We treat intent recognition as a multi-label classification problem, using a graph convolutional network to infuse prior knowledge through label embedding correlations. Demonstrated by a state-of-the-art performance on the Intentonomy and MDID datasets, our approach advances the accuracy of existing methods while also possessing good interpretability. Our work provides an attempt for future explorations in understanding complex and miscellaneous forms of human expression.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[What is the Added Value of UDA in the VFM Era?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18190v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) can improve a perception model's generalization to an unlabeled target domain starting from a labeled source domain. UDA using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with synthetic source data can achieve generalization performance comparable to fully-supervised learning with real target data. However, because VFMs have strong generalization from their pre-training, more straightforward, source-only fine-tuning can also perform well on the target. As data scenarios used in academic research are not necessarily representative for real-world applications, it is currently unclear (a) how UDA behaves with more representative and diverse data and (b) if source-only fine-tuning of VFMs can perform equally well in these scenarios. Our research aims to close these gaps and, similar to previous studies, we focus on semantic segmentation as a representative perception task. We assess UDA for synth-to-real and real-to-real use cases with different source and target data combinations. We also investigate the effect of using a small amount of labeled target data in UDA. We clarify that while these scenarios are more realistic, they are not necessarily more challenging. Our results show that, when using stronger synthetic source data, UDA's improvement over source-only fine-tuning of VFMs reduces from +8 mIoU to +2 mIoU, and when using more diverse real source data, UDA has no added value. However, UDA generalization is always higher in all synthetic data scenarios than source-only fine-tuning and, when including only 1/16 of Cityscapes labels, synthetic UDA obtains the same state-of-the-art segmentation quality of 85 mIoU as a fully-supervised model using all labels. Considering the mixed results, we discuss how UDA can best support robust autonomous driving at scale.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing token pruning methods often overlook fundamental visual data characteristics. This study introduces 'LVTP', a progressive token pruning framework guided by multi-scale Tsallis entropy and low-level visual features with twice clustering. It integrates high-level semantics and basic visual attributes for precise segmentation. A novel dynamic scoring mechanism using multi-scale Tsallis entropy weighting overcomes limitations of traditional single-parameter entropy. The framework also incorporates low-level feature analysis to preserve critical edge information while optimizing computational cost. As a plug-and-play module, it requires no architectural changes or additional training. Evaluations across multiple datasets show 20%-45% computational reductions with negligible performance loss, outperforming existing methods in balancing cost and accuracy, especially in complex edge regions.</p></details> |  | None |

The platform is built using a multi-modal data-enabled traffic environment constructed from drone-based aerial LiDAR, OpenStreetMap, and vehicle sensor data (e.g., GPS and inclinometer readings). High-resolution 3D road geometries are generated through AI-powered semantic segmentation and georeferencing of aerial LiDAR data.

CARLA provides detailed micro-level sensor and perception data, while SUMO manages macro-level traffic flow. NVIDIA PhysX enables accurate modeling of vehicle behaviors under diverse conditions, accounting for mass distribution, tire friction, and center of mass. This integrated system supports high-fidelity simulations that capture the complex interactions between autonomous and conventional vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate the platform's ability to reproduce realistic vehicle dynamics and traffic scenarios, enhancing the analysis of active safety measures. Overall, the proposed framework advances traffic safety research by enabling in-depth, physics-informed evaluation of vehicle behavior in dynamic and heterogeneous traffic environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 18 figures | None |

In particular, when objects exists as small pixel-sized entities in a large context of similar objects. Deep learning approaches using supervised models with pre-trained weights, such as residual networks and vision transformers have demonstrated success for many applications. Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of learned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable performance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using self-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then applied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven to be effective to obtain representations that captures global context information. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to reconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for various applications. However, if the sizes of the objects in images are less than the size of the mask, the global context information is lost, making it almost impossible to reconstruct the image. In this study, we investigated the effect of mask ratios and patch sizes for blood components using a MAE to obtain learned ViT encoder representations. We then applied the encoder weights to train a U-Net Transformer for semantic segmentation to obtain both local and global contextual information. Our experimental results demonstrates that both smaller mask ratios and patch sizes improve the reconstruction of images using a MAE. We also show the results of semantic segmentation with and without pre-trained weights, where smaller-sized blood components benefited with pre-training. Overall, our proposed method offers an efficient and effective strategy for the segmentation and classification of small objects.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods, though accurate, typically assume consistent illumination, which is often violated due to dynamic lighting and occlusions caused by GI motility. These variations lead to incorrect geometric interpretations and unreliable self-supervised signals, degrading depth reconstruction quality. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware self-supervised framework. First, we incorporate an occlusion mask for data augmentation, generating pseudo-labels by simulating viewpoint-dependent occlusion scenarios. This enhances the model's ability to learn robust depth features under partial visibility. Second, we leverage semantic segmentation guided by non-negative matrix factorization, clustering convolutional activations to generate pseudo-labels in texture-deprived regions, thereby improving segmentation accuracy and mitigating information loss from lighting changes. Experimental results on the SCARED dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised depth estimation. Additionally, evaluations on the Endo-SLAM and SERV-CT datasets demonstrate strong generalization across diverse endoscopic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to MEDIA</p></details> | None |

Traditional RGB-D processing pipelines focus primarily on geometric reconstruction, limiting their ability to support advanced robotic perception, planning, and interaction. A key challenge is the lack of generalized methods for segmenting RGB-D data into semantically meaningful components while maintaining accurate geometric representations. We introduce a novel end-to-end modular pipeline that integrates state-of-the-art semantic segmentation, human tracking, point-cloud fusion, and scene reconstruction. Our approach improves semantic segmentation accuracy by leveraging the foundational segmentation model SAM2 with a hybrid method that combines its mask generation with a semantic classification model, resulting in sharper masks and high classification accuracy. Compared to SegFormer and OneFormer, our method achieves a similar semantic segmentation accuracy (mIoU of 47.0% vs 45.9% in the ADE20K dataset) but provides much more precise object boundaries. Additionally, our human tracking algorithm interacts with the segmentation enabling continuous tracking even when objects leave and re-enter the frame by object re-identification. Our point cloud fusion approach reduces computation time by 1.81x while maintaining a small mean reconstruction error of 25.3 mm by leveraging the semantic information. We validate our approach on benchmark datasets and real-world Kinect RGB-D data, demonstrating improved efficiency, accuracy, and usability. Our structured representation, stored in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, supports efficient querying, visualization, and robotic simulation, making it practical for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful strategy for addressing the scarcity of labeled data in these novel environments. This paper represents one of the first efforts in evaluating the feasibility of employing adapters toward efficient transfer learning for rock segmentation in extraterrestrial landscapes, mainly focusing on lunar and martian terrains. Our work suggests that the use of adapters, strategically integrated into a pre-trained backbone model, can be successful in reducing both bandwidth and memory requirements for the target extraterrestrial device. In this study, we considered two memory-saving strategies: layer fusion (to reduce to zero the inference overhead) and an ``adapter ranking'' (to also reduce the transmission cost). Finally, we evaluate these results in terms of task performance, memory, and computation on embedded devices, evidencing trade-offs that open the road to more research in the field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PolyFootNet: Extracting Polygonal Building Footprints in Off-Nadir Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08645v4)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting polygonal building footprints from off-nadir imagery is crucial for diverse applications. Current deep-learning-based extraction approaches predominantly rely on semantic segmentation paradigms and post-processing algorithms, limiting their boundary precision and applicability. However, existing polygonal extraction methodologies are inherently designed for near-nadir imagery and fail under the geometric complexities introduced by off-nadir viewing angles. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Polygonal Footprint Network (PolyFootNet), a novel deep-learning framework that directly outputs polygonal building footprints without requiring external post-processing steps. PolyFootNet employs a High-Quality Mask Prompter to generate precise roof masks, which guide polygonal vertex extraction in a unified model pipeline. A key contribution of PolyFootNet is introducing the Self Offset Attention mechanism, grounded in Nadaraya-Watson regression, to effectively mitigate the accuracy discrepancy observed between low-rise and high-rise buildings. This approach allows low-rise building predictions to leverage angular corrections learned from high-rise building offsets, significantly enhancing overall extraction accuracy. Additionally, motivated by the inherent ambiguity of building footprint extraction tasks, we systematically investigate alternative extraction paradigms and demonstrate that a combined approach of building masks and offsets achieves superior polygonal footprint results. Extensive experiments validate PolyFootNet's effectiveness, illustrating its promising potential as a robust, generalizable, and precise polygonal building footprint extraction method from challenging off-nadir imagery. To facilitate further research, we will release pre-trained weights of our offset prediction module at https://github.com/likaiucas/PolyFootNet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/likaiucas/PolyFootNet) |

Prior work has focused on meta-learning for support-query matching, with extensive development in both prototype-based and aggregation-based methods. To address data scarcity, recent approaches have turned to foundation models to enhance representation transferability for novel class segmentation. Among them, a hybrid dual-modal framework including both DINOv2 and SAM has garnered attention due to their complementary capabilities. We wonder "can we build a unified model with knowledge from both foundation models?" To this end, we propose FS-DINO, with only DINOv2's encoder and a lightweight segmenter. The segmenter features a bottleneck adapter, a meta-visual prompt generator based on dense similarities and semantic embeddings, and a decoder. Through coarse-to-fine cross-model distillation, we effectively integrate SAM's knowledge into our lightweight segmenter, which can be further enhanced by 4D correlation mining on support-query pairs. Extensive experiments on COCO-20i, PASCAL-5i, and FSS-1000 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Segmentation with Noisy Labels via Spatially Correlated Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14795v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the posterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial correlations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between adjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured by a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\"{o} (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels.

Although prior work have approached answering this question, their assessment methods do not directly translate to how these models are used in practical vision-language tasks. In this paper, we propose a direct assessment method, inspired by linear probing, to assess vision-language alignment. We identify that the degree of alignment of the SSL vision models depends on their SSL training objective, and we find that the clustering quality of SSL representations has a stronger impact on alignment performance than their linear separability. Next, we introduce Swift Alignment of Image and Language (SAIL), a efficient transfer learning framework that aligns pretrained unimodal vision and language models for downstream vision-language tasks. Since SAIL leverages the strengths of pretrained unimodal models, it requires significantly fewer (6%) paired image-text data for the multimodal alignment compared to models like CLIP which are trained from scratch. SAIL training only requires a single A100 GPU, 5 hours of training and can accommodate a batch size up to 32,768. SAIL achieves 73.4% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet (vs. CLIP's 72.7%) and excels in zero-shot retrieval, complex reasoning, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, SAIL improves the language-compatibility of vision encoders that in turn enhance the performance of multimodal large language models.

However, they can also provide significant utility for downstream 3D tasks that can leverage the cross-modal information (e.g., from paired image data). In our work, we further explore the utility of VFMs for adapting from a labeled source to unlabeled target data for the task of LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation. Our method consumes paired 2D-3D (image and point cloud) data and relies on the robust (cross-domain) features from a VFM to train a 3D backbone on a mix of labeled source and unlabeled target data. At the heart of our method lies a fusion network that is guided by both the image and point cloud streams, with their relative contributions adjusted based on the target domain. We extensively compare our proposed methodology with different state-of-the-art methods in several settings and achieve strong performance gains. For example, achieving an average improvement of 6.5 mIoU (over all tasks), when compared with the previous state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, neural implicit representation has provided a promising direction for online interactive mapping. However, implementing open-vocabulary scene understanding capability into online neural implicit mapping still faces three challenges: lack of local scene updating ability, blurry spatial hierarchical semantic segmentation and difficulty in maintaining multi-view consistency. To this end, we proposed O2V-mapping, which utilizes voxel-based language and geometric features to create an open-vocabulary field, thus allowing for local updates during online training process. Additionally, we leverage a foundational model for image segmentation to extract language features on object-level entities, achieving clear segmentation boundaries and hierarchical semantic features. For the purpose of preserving consistency in 3D object properties across different viewpoints, we propose a spatial adaptive voxel adjustment mechanism and a multi-view weight selection method. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary object localization and semantic segmentation demonstrate that O2V-mapping achieves online construction of language scenes while enhancing accuracy, outperforming the previous SOTA method.</p></details> | ECCV2024 | None |

While deep learning has significantly advanced crack detection algorithms, existing models often require extensive labeled datasets and high computational costs for fine-tuning, limiting their adaptability across diverse conditions. This study introduces an efficient selective fine-tuning strategy, focusing on tuning normalization components, to enhance the adaptability of segmentation models for crack detection. The proposed method is applied to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and five well-established segmentation models. Experimental results demonstrate that selective fine-tuning of only normalization parameters outperforms full fine-tuning and other common fine-tuning techniques in both performance and computational efficiency, while improving generalization. The proposed approach yields a SAM-based model, Segment Any Crack (SAC), achieving a 61.22\% F1-score and 44.13\% IoU on the OmniCrack30k benchmark dataset, along with the highest performance across three zero-shot datasets and the lowest standard deviation.

Numerous works based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and Transformer architectures have been proposed to leverage local and global contextual learning for efficient and accurate semantic segmentation. In both architectures, the encoder often relies heavily on extracting continuous representations from the image, which limits the ability to represent meaningful discrete information. To address this limitation, we propose segmentation of the autonomous driving environment using vector quantization. Vector quantization offers three primary advantages for road environment segmentation. (1) Each continuous feature from the encoder is mapped to a discrete vector from the codebook, helping the model discover distinct features more easily than with complex continuous features. (2) Since a discrete feature acts as compressed versions of the encoder's continuous features, they also compress noise or outliers, enhancing the image segmentation task. (3) Vector quantization encourages the latent space to form coarse clusters of continuous features, forcing the model to group similar features, making the learned representations more structured for the decoding process. In this work, we combined vector quantization with the lightweight image segmentation model MobileUNETR and used it as a baseline model for comparison to demonstrate its efficiency. Through experiments, we achieved 77.0 % mIoU on Cityscapes, outperforming the baseline by 2.9 % without increasing the model's initial size or complexity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Occlusion-Ordered Semantic Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14054v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard semantic instance segmentation provides useful, but inherently 2D information from a single image. To enable 3D analysis, one usually integrates absolute monocular depth estimation with instance segmentation. However, monocular depth is a difficult task. Instead, we leverage a simpler single-image task, occlusion-based relative depth ordering, providing coarser but useful 3D information. We show that relative depth ordering works more reliably from occlusions than from absolute depth. We propose to solve the joint task of relative depth ordering and segmentation of instances based on occlusions. We call this task Occlusion-Ordered Semantic Instance Segmentation (OOSIS). We develop an approach to OOSIS that extracts instances and their occlusion order simultaneously from oriented occlusion boundaries and semantic segmentation. Unlike popular detect-and-segment framework for instance segmentation, combining occlusion ordering with instance segmentation allows a simple and clean formulation of OOSIS as a labeling problem. As a part of our solution for OOSIS, we develop a novel oriented occlusion boundaries approach that significantly outperforms prior work. We also develop a new joint OOSIS metric based both on instance mask accuracy and correctness of their occlusion order. We achieve better performance than strong baselines on KINS and COCOA datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods overlook the inherent differences in how RGB and depth images express information. Properly distinguishing the processing of RGB and depth images is essential to fully exploiting their unique and significant characteristics. To address this, we propose a novel heterogeneous dual-branch framework called HDBFormer, specifically designed to handle these modality differences. For RGB images, which contain rich detail, we employ both a basic and detail encoder to extract local and global features. For the simpler depth images, we propose LDFormer, a lightweight hierarchical encoder that efficiently extracts depth features with fewer parameters. Additionally, we introduce the Modality Information Interaction Module (MIIM), which combines transformers with large kernel convolutions to interact global and local information across modalities efficiently. Extensive experiments show that HDBFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUDepthv2 and SUN-RGBD datasets.

Nevertheless, SAR imagery lacks detailed information and is plagued by significant speckle noise, rendering the annotation or segmentation of SAR images a formidable task. Recent efforts have resorted to annotating paired optical-SAR images to generate pseudo-labels through the utilization of an optical image segmentation network. However, these pseudo-labels are laden with noise, leading to suboptimal performance in SAR image segmentation. In this study, we introduce a more precise method for generating pseudo-labels by incorporating semi-supervised learning alongside a novel image resolution alignment augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a symmetric cross-entropy loss to mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels. Additionally, a bag of training and testing tricks is utilized to generate better land-cover mapping results. Our experiments on the GRSS data fusion contest indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves first place.

The proposed technique integrates UNet, channel and spatial attention, edge-detection based skip-connection and deep supervised learning to improve the accuracy of the CMR image-segmentation. Images are processed using multiple channels to generate multiple feature-maps. We built a dual attention-based model to integrate channel and spatial attention. The use of extracted edges in skip connection improves the reconstructed images from feature-maps. The use of deep supervision reduces vanishing gradient problems inherent in classification based on deep neural networks. The algorithms for dual attention-based model, corresponding implementation and performance results are described. The performance results show that this approach has attained high accuracy: 98% Dice Similarity Score (DSC) and significantly lower Hausdorff Distance (HD). The performance results outperform other leading techniques both in DSC and HD.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Cardiac MRI Semantic Segmentation for Ventricles and Myocardium using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13391v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated noninvasive cardiac diagnosis plays a critical role in the early detection of cardiac disorders and cost-effective clinical management. Automated diagnosis involves the automated segmentation and analysis of cardiac images. Precise delineation of cardiac substructures and extraction of their morphological attributes are essential for evaluating the cardiac function, and diagnosing cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy, valvular diseases, abnormalities related to septum perforations, and blood-flow rate. Semantic segmentation labels the CMR image at the pixel level, and localizes its subcomponents to facilitate the detection of abnormalities, including abnormalities in cardiac wall motion in an aging heart with muscle abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, and valvular abnormalities. In this paper, we describe a model to improve semantic segmentation of CMR images. The model extracts edge-attributes and context information during down-sampling of the U-Net and infuses this information during up-sampling to localize three major cardiac structures: left ventricle cavity (LV); right ventricle cavity (RV); and LV myocardium (LMyo). We present an algorithm and performance results. A comparison of our model with previous leading models, using similarity metrics between actual image and segmented image, shows that our approach improves Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 2%-11% and lowers Hausdorff distance (HD) by 1.6 to 5.7 mm.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Benchmarking the Spatial Robustness of DNNs via Natural and Adversarial Localized Corruptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01632v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness of DNNs is a crucial factor in safety-critical applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments where localized corruptions can arise. While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of localized corruptions. Furthermore, we uncover the inherent complexity of characterizing worst-case robustness using a single localized adversarial perturbation. To address this, we propose region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis, a method that enables a deeper understanding of model robustness against adversarial perturbations applied to specific regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones and vice-versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[SAR Object Detection with Self-Supervised Pretraining and Curriculum-Aware Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13310v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery holds immense potential in tasks such as urban monitoring and disaster response. However, the inherent complexities of SAR data and the scarcity of annotations present significant challenges in the advancement of object detection in this domain. Notably, the detection of small objects in satellite-borne SAR images poses a particularly intricate problem, because of the technology's relatively low spatial resolution and inherent noise. Furthermore, the lack of large labelled SAR datasets hinders the development of supervised deep learning-based object detection models. In this paper, we introduce TRANSAR, a novel self-supervised end-to-end vision transformer-based SAR object detection model that incorporates masked image pre-training on an unlabeled SAR image dataset that spans more than $25,700$ km\textsuperscript{2} ground area. Unlike traditional object detection formulation, our approach capitalises on auxiliary binary semantic segmentation, designed to segregate objects of interest during the post-tuning, especially the smaller ones, from the background. In addition, to address the innate class imbalance due to the disproportion of the object to the image size, we introduce an adaptive sampling scheduler that dynamically adjusts the target class distribution during training based on curriculum learning and model feedback. This approach allows us to outperform conventional supervised architecture such as DeepLabv3 or UNet, and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based arhitectures such as DPT, SegFormer or UperNet, as shown by extensive evaluations on benchmark SAR datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 ML4RS https://ml-for-rs.github.io/iclr2025/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ml-for-rs.github.io/iclr2025) |

| **[Unified Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13254v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer the supervision from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of existing UDA-SS works typically consider images whilst recent attempts have extended further to tackle videos by modeling the temporal dimension. Although the two lines of research share the major challenges -- overcoming the underlying domain distribution shift, their studies are largely independent, resulting in fragmented insights, a lack of holistic understanding, and missed opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas. This fragmentation prevents the unification of methods, leading to redundant efforts and suboptimal knowledge transfer across image and video domains. Under this observation, we advocate unifying the study of UDA-SS across video and image scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive understanding, synergistic advancements, and efficient knowledge sharing. To that end, we explore the unified UDA-SS from a general data augmentation perspective, serving as a unifying conceptual framework, enabling improved generalization, and potential for cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately contributing to the overall progress and practical impact of this field of research. Specifically, we propose a Quad-directional Mixup (QuadMix) method, characterized by tackling distinct point attributes and feature inconsistencies through four-directional paths for intra- and inter-domain mixing in a feature space. To deal with temporal shifts with videos, we incorporate optical flow-guided feature aggregation across spatial and temporal dimensions for fine-grained domain alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works by large margins on four challenging UDA-SS benchmarks.

| **[High-Fidelity Image Inpainting with Multimodal Guided GAN Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12844v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion have demonstrated excellent performance in image inpainting that aims to restore lost or damaged image texture using its unmasked content. Previous GAN inversion-based methods usually utilize well-trained GAN models as effective priors to generate the realistic regions for missing holes. Despite excellence, they ignore a hard constraint that the unmasked regions in the input and the output should be the same, resulting in a gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting and thus degrading the performance. Besides, existing GAN inversion approaches often consider a single modality of the input image, neglecting other auxiliary cues in images for improvements. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel GAN inversion approach, dubbed MMInvertFill, for image inpainting. MMInvertFill contains primarily a multimodal guided encoder with a pre-modulation and a GAN generator with F&W+ latent space. Specifically, the multimodal encoder aims to enhance the multi-scale structures with additional semantic segmentation edge texture modalities through a gated mask-aware attention module. Afterwards, a pre-modulation is presented to encode these structures into style vectors. To mitigate issues of conspicuous color discrepancy and semantic inconsistency, we introduce the F&W+ latent space to bridge the gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting. Furthermore, in order to reconstruct faithful and photorealistic images, we devise a simple yet effective Soft-update Mean Latent module to capture more diversified in-domain patterns for generating high-fidelity textures for massive corruptions. In our extensive experiments on six challenging datasets, we show that our MMInvertFill qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-arts and it supports the completion of out-of-domain images effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCV. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2208.11850</p></details> | None |

Compared to contrastive approaches that only yield binary learning signals, i.e., 'attract' and 'repel', this approach benefits from the more fine-grained learning signal of sorting spatially dense features relative to reference patches. Our method leverages differentiable sorting applied on top of pretrained representations, such as DINOv2-registers to bootstrap the learning signal and further improve upon them. This dense post-pretraining leads to superior performance across various models and datasets, despite requiring only 19 hours on a single GPU. This method generates high-quality dense feature encoders and establishes several new state-of-the-art results such as +5.5% and +6% for non-parametric in-context semantic segmentation on ADE20k and Pascal VOC, +7.2% and +5.7% for linear segmentation evaluations on COCO-Things and -Stuff and improvements in the 3D understanding of multi-view consistency on SPair-71k, by more than 1.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR25.

However, recent methods often overlook the fact that visual cues are susceptible, whereas the underlying geometry remains stable, rendering depth information more robust. In this paper, we investigate the potential of integrating depth information with features from VFMs, to improve the geometric consistency within an image and boost the generalization performance of VFMs. We propose a novel fine-tuning DGSS framework, named DepthForge, which integrates the visual cues from frozen DINOv2 or EVA02 and depth cues from frozen Depth Anything V2. In each layer of the VFMs, we incorporate depth-aware learnable tokens to continuously decouple domain-invariant visual and spatial information, thereby enhancing depth awareness and attention of the VFMs. Finally, we develop a depth refinement decoder and integrate it into the model architecture to adaptively refine multi-layer VFM features and depth-aware learnable tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted based on various DGSS settings and five different datsets as unseen target domains. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches with stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial attention, and superior generalization ability. In particular, DepthForge exhibits outstanding performance under extreme conditions (e.g., night and snow).

Our work introduces active learning in surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374 mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE EMBS ISC Australia 2022</p></details> | None |

The use of computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However, privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage, we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.</p></details> |  | None |

To alleviate this, we introduce 3D-PointZshotS, a geometry-aware zero-shot segmentation framework that enhances both feature generation and alignment using latent geometric prototypes (LGPs). Specifically, we integrate LGPs into a generator via a cross-attention mechanism, enriching semantic features with fine-grained geometric details. To further enhance stability and generalization, we introduce a self-consistency loss, which enforces feature robustness against point-wise perturbations. Additionally, we re-represent visual and semantic features in a shared space, bridging the semantic-visual gap and facilitating knowledge transfer to unseen classes. Experiments on three real-world datasets, namely ScanNet, SemanticKITTI, and S3DIS, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over four baselines in terms of harmonic mIoU.

Large terrestrial mammalian herbivores are keystone species as their activity not only has deep effects on soils, plants, and animals, but also shapes landscapes, as large herbivores act as allogenic ecosystem engineers. One key landscape feature that indicates intense herbivore activity and potentially impacts biodiversity is the formation of grazing trails. Grazing trails are formed by the continuous trampling activity of large herbivores that can produce complex networks of tracks of bare soil. Here, we evaluated different algorithms based on machine learning techniques to identify grazing trails. Our goal is to automatically detect potential areas with intense herbivory activity, which might be beneficial for conservation and management plans. We have applied five semantic segmentation methods combined with fourteen encoders aimed at mapping grazing trails on aerial images. Our results indicate that in most cases the chosen methodology successfully mapped the trails, although there were a few instances where the actual trail structure was underestimated. The UNet architecture with the MambaOut encoder was the best architecture for mapping trails. The proposed approach could be applied to develop tools for mapping and monitoring temporal changes in these landscape structures to support habitat conservation and land management programs. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that competitive image segmentation results are obtained for the detection and delineation of trails of large herbivorous mammals.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures.

However, current high-performance models demand significant resources, making deployment costs prohibitive and highlighting the need for compact, yet effective models. For UDA of lightweight models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) leveraging a Teacher-Student framework could be a common approach, but we found that domain shift in UDA leads to a significant increase in non-salient parameters in the teacher model, degrading model's generalization ability and transferring misleading information to the student model. Interestingly, we observed that this phenomenon occurs considerably less in the student model. Driven by this insight, we introduce Collaborative Learning for UDA (CLDA), a method that updates the teacher's non-salient parameters using the student model and at the same time utilizes the updated teacher model to improve UDA performance of the student model. Experiments show consistent performance improvements for both student and teacher models. For example, in semantic segmentation, CLDA achieves an improvement of +0.7% mIoU for the teacher model and +1.4% mIoU for the student model compared to the baseline model in the GTA-to-Cityscapes datasets. In the Synthia-to-Cityscapes dataset, it achieves an improvement of +0.8% mIoU and +2.0% mIoU for the teacher and student models, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, their real-time deployment on edge platforms remains constrained by decoder complexity. Herein, we introduce LightFormer, a lightweight decoder for time-critical tasks that involve unstructured targets, such as disaster assessment, unmanned aerial vehicle search-and-rescue, and cultural heritage monitoring. LightFormer employs a feature-fusion and refinement module built on channel processing and a learnable gating mechanism to aggregate multi-scale, multi-range information efficiently, which drastically curtails model complexity. Furthermore, we propose a spatial information selection module (SISM) that integrates long-range attention with a detail preservation branch to capture spatial dependencies across multiple scales, thereby substantially improving the recognition of unstructured targets in complex scenes. On the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark, LightFormer attains 99.9% of GLFFNet's mIoU (83.9% vs. 84.0%) while requiring only 14.7% of its FLOPs and 15.9% of its parameters, thus achieving an excellent accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Consistent results on LoveDA, ISPRS Potsdam, RescueNet, and FloodNet further demonstrate its robustness and superior perception of unstructured objects. These findings highlight LightFormer as a practical solution for remote sensing applications where both computational economy and high-precision segmentation are imperative.</p></details> | 26 pages, 69 figures | None |
| **[OmniVDiff: Omni Controllable Video Diffusion for Generation and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10825v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel framework for controllable video diffusion, OmniVDiff, aiming to synthesize and comprehend multiple video visual content in a single diffusion model. To achieve this, OmniVDiff treats all video visual modalities in the color space to learn a joint distribution, while employing an adaptive control strategy that dynamically adjusts the role of each visual modality during the diffusion process, either as a generation modality or a conditioning modality. This allows flexible manipulation of each modality's role, enabling support for a wide range of tasks. Consequently, our model supports three key functionalities: (1) Text-conditioned video generation: multi-modal visual video sequences (i.e., rgb, depth, canny, segmentaion) are generated based on the text conditions in one diffusion process; (2) Video understanding: OmniVDiff can estimate the depth, canny map, and semantic segmentation across the input rgb frames while ensuring coherence with the rgb input; and (3) X-conditioned video generation: OmniVDiff generates videos conditioned on fine-grained attributes (e.g., depth maps or segmentation maps). By integrating these diverse tasks into a unified video diffusion framework, OmniVDiff enhances the flexibility and scalability for controllable video diffusion, making it an effective tool for a variety of downstream applications, such as video-to-video translation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential for various video-related applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page: https://tele-ai.github.io/OmniVDiff/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://tele-ai.github.io/OmniVDiff) |

However, due to environmental factors and the issues of the imaging system, the image quality is often degraded which may impair subsequent visual tasks. Even though denoising remote sensing images plays an essential role before applications, the current denoising algorithms fail to attain optimum performance since these images possess complex features in the texture. Denoising frameworks based on artificial neural networks have shown better performance; however, they require exhaustive training with heterogeneous samples that extensively consume resources like power, memory, computation, and latency. Thus, here we present a computationally efficient and robust remote sensing image denoising method that doesn't require additional training samples. This method partitions patches of a remote-sensing image in which a low-rank manifold, representing the noise-free version of the image, underlies the patch space. An efficient and robust approach to revealing this manifold is a randomized approximation of the singular value spectrum of the geodesics' Gramian matrix of the patch space. The method asserts a unique emphasis on each color channel during denoising so the three denoised channels are merged to produce the final image.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, and submitted to the International Journal of Remote Sensing</p></details> | None |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Detection & Applications With Ablated Learned Temperature Energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12129v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As deep neural networks become adopted in high-stakes domains, it is crucial to identify when inference inputs are Out-of-Distribution (OOD) so that users can be alerted of likely drops in performance and calibration despite high confidence -- ultimately to know when networks' decisions (and their uncertainty in those decisions) should be trusted. In this paper we introduce Ablated Learned Temperature Energy (or "AbeT" for short), an OOD detection method which lowers the False Positive Rate at 95\% True Positive Rate (FPR@95) by $43.43\%$ in classification compared to state of the art without training networks in multiple stages or requiring hyperparameters or test-time backward passes. We additionally provide empirical insights as to why our model learns to distinguish between In-Distribution (ID) and OOD samples while only being explicitly trained on ID samples via exposure to misclassified ID examples at training time. Lastly, we show the efficacy of our method in identifying predicted bounding boxes and pixels corresponding to OOD objects in object detection and semantic segmentation, respectively -- with an AUROC increase of $5.15\%$ in object detection and both a decrease in FPR@95 of $41.48\%$ and an increase in AUPRC of $34.20\%$ in semantic segmentation compared to previous state of the art.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Real-time Seafloor Segmentation and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10750v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Posidonia oceanica meadows are a species of seagrass highly dependent on rocks for their survival and conservation. In recent years, there has been a concerning global decline in this species, emphasizing the critical need for efficient monitoring and assessment tools. While deep learning-based semantic segmentation and visual automated monitoring systems have shown promise in a variety of applications, their performance in underwater environments remains challenging due to complex water conditions and limited datasets. This paper introduces a framework that combines machine learning and computer vision techniques to enable an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to inspect the boundaries of Posidonia oceanica meadows autonomously. The framework incorporates an image segmentation module using an existing Mask R-CNN model and a strategy for Posidonia oceanica meadow boundary tracking. Furthermore, a new class dedicated to rocks is introduced to enhance the existing model, aiming to contribute to a comprehensive monitoring approach and provide a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions between the meadow and its surrounding environment. The image segmentation model is validated using real underwater images, while the overall inspection framework is evaluated in a realistic simulation environment, replicating actual monitoring scenarios with real underwater images. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables the AUV to autonomously accomplish the main tasks of underwater inspection and segmentation of rocks. Consequently, this work holds significant potential for the conservation and protection of marine environments, providing valuable insights into the status of Posidonia oceanica meadows and supporting targeted preservation efforts</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we challenge this status quo and investigate the impact of templates for OVSS. Empirically, we observe that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers significantly outperforming the conventional averaged classifier. We refer to them as class-experts. Given access to unlabeled images and without any training involved, we estimate these experts by leveraging the class-wise prediction entropy of single-template classifiers, selecting as class-wise experts those which yield the lowest entropy. All experts, each specializing in a specific class, collaborate in a newly proposed fusion method to generate more accurate OVSS predictions. Our plug-and-play method, coined FLOSS, is orthogonal and complementary to existing OVSS methods, offering a ''free lunch'' to systematically improve OVSS without labels and additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLOSS consistently boosts state-of-the-art methods on various OVSS benchmarks. Moreover, the selected expert templates can generalize well from one dataset to others sharing the same semantic categories, yet exhibiting distribution shifts. Additionally, we obtain satisfactory improvements under a low-data regime, where only a few unlabeled images are available.

Unlike existing modular MLLMs, which rely on a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT), SAIL eliminates the need for a separate vision encoder, presenting a more minimalist architecture design. Instead of introducing novel architectural components, SAIL adapts mix-attention mechanisms and multimodal positional encodings to better align with the distinct characteristics of visual and textual modalities. We systematically compare SAIL's properties-including scalability, cross-modal information flow patterns, and visual representation capabilities-with those of modular MLLMs. By scaling both training data and model size, SAIL achieves performance comparable to modular MLLMs. Notably, the removal of pretrained ViT components enhances SAIL's scalability and results in significantly different cross-modal information flow patterns. Moreover, SAIL demonstrates strong visual representation capabilities, achieving results on par with ViT-22B in vision tasks such as semantic segmentation.

These foundational models, especially CLIP, have accelerated research in open-vocabulary computer vision tasks, including Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). Although the initial results are promising, the dense prediction capabilities of VLMs still require further improvement. In this study, we enhance the semantic segmentation performance of CLIP by introducing new modules and modifications: 1) architectural changes in the last layer of ViT and the incorporation of attention maps from the middle layers with the last layer, 2) Image Engineering: applying data augmentations to enrich input image representations, and 3) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate definitions and synonyms for each class name to leverage CLIP's open-vocabulary capabilities.

This damage is particularly prevalent in rural areas due to less frequent surveying and maintenance of roads. Automated detection of pavement deterioration can be used as an input to AVs and driver assistance systems to improve road safety. Current research in this field has predominantly focused on urban environments driven largely by public datasets, while rural areas have received significantly less attention. This paper introduces M2S-RoAD, a dataset for the semantic segmentation of different classes of road damage. M2S-RoAD was collected in various towns across New South Wales, Australia, and labelled for semantic segmentation to identify nine distinct types of road damage.

DNNs sometimes fail to generalize ontest data sampled from different input distributions. Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA)techniques have been proven useful when no labels are available, and when distribution shifts are observed in the target domain (TD). In the present study, experiments are performed on seismic images of the F3 block 3D dataset from offshore Netherlands (source domain; SD) and Penobscot 3D survey data from Canada (target domain; TD). Three geological classes from SD and TD that have similar reflection patterns are considered. A deep neural network architecture named EarthAdaptNet (EAN) is proposed to semantically segment the seismic images when few classes have data scarcity, and we use a transposed residual unit to replace the traditional dilated convolution in the decoder block. The EAN achieved a pixel-level accuracy >84% and an accuracy of ~70% for the minority classes, showing improved performance compared to existing architectures. In addition, we introduce the CORAL (Correlation Alignment) method to the EAN to create an unsupervised deep domain adaptation network (EAN-DDA) for the classification of seismic reflections from F3 and Penobscot, to demonstrate possible approaches when labelled data are unavailable. Maximum class accuracy achieved was ~99% for class 2 of Penobscot, with an overall accuracy>50%.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) UDA methods primarily use self-training with architecturally identical teacher and student networks, relying on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) updates. However, these approaches face substantial performance degradation with lightweight models due to inherent architectural inflexibility leading to low-quality pseudo-labels. To address this, we propose Distilled Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DUDA), a novel framework that combines EMA-based self-training with knowledge distillation (KD). Our method employs an auxiliary student network to bridge the architectural gap between heavyweight and lightweight models for EMA-based updates, resulting in improved pseudo-label quality. DUDA employs a strategic fusion of UDA and KD, incorporating innovative elements such as gradual distillation from large to small networks, inconsistency loss prioritizing poorly adapted classes, and learning with multiple teachers. Extensive experiments across four UDA benchmarks demonstrate DUDA's superiority in achieving SOTA performance with lightweight models, often surpassing the performance of heavyweight models from other approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances primarily focus on pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, and co-training strategies. However, existing methods struggle to balance global semantic representation with fine-grained local feature extraction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel tri-branch semi-supervised segmentation framework incorporating a dual-teacher strategy, named IGL-DT. Our approach employs SwinUnet for high-level semantic guidance through Global Context Learning and ResUnet for detailed feature refinement via Local Regional Learning. Additionally, a Discrepancy Learning mechanism mitigates over-reliance on a single teacher, promoting adaptive feature learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior segmentation performance across various data regimes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

Contemporary approaches to detecting RFI treat the task as a semantic segmentation problem on radio telescope spectrograms. Typically, complex heuristic algorithms handle this task of `flagging' in combination with manual labeling (in the most difficult cases). While recent machine-learning approaches have demonstrated high accuracy, they often fail to meet the stringent operational requirements of modern radio observatories. Owing to their inherently time-varying nature, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising alternative method to RFI-detection by utilizing the time-varying nature of the spectrographic source data. In this work, we apply Liquid State Machines (LSMs), a class of spiking neural networks, to RFI-detection. We employ second-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LiF) neurons, marking the first use of this architecture and neuron type for RFI-detection. We test three encoding methods and three increasingly complex readout layers, including a transformer decoder head, providing a hybrid of SNN and ANN techniques. Our methods extend LSMs beyond conventional classification tasks to fine-grained spatio-temporal segmentation. We train LSMs on simulated data derived from the Hyrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a known benchmark for RFI-detection. Our model achieves a per-pixel accuracy of 98% and an F1-score of 0.743, demonstrating competitive performance on this highly challenging task. This work expands the sophistication of SNN techniques and architectures applied to RFI-detection, and highlights the effectiveness of LSMs in handling fine-grained, complex, spatio-temporal signal-processing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted for publication at IJCNN 2025</p></details> | None |

Current approaches typically incorporate physical priors to animate 3D representations, but these methods suffer from significant limitations: they not only require users lacking physics expertise to manually specify material properties but also struggle to effectively handle the generation of multi-material composite objects. To address these challenges, we propose Phys4DGen, a novel 4D generation framework that integrates multi-material composition perception with physical simulation. The framework achieves automated, physically plausible 4D generation through three innovative modules: first, the 3D Material Grouping module partitions heterogeneous material regions on 3D representation surfaces via semantic segmentation; second, the Internal Physical Structure Discovery module constructs the mechanical structure of object interiors; finally, we distill physical prior knowledge from multimodal large language models to enable rapid and automatic material properties identification for both objects' surfaces and interiors. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Phys4DGen can generate high-fidelity 4D content with physical realism in open-world scenarios, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures.

However, in real-world scenarios, the environment is evolving. Thus, offline-trained segmentation models may lead to catastrophic forgetting of previously seen classes. Class-incremental learning (CIL) is designed to address the problem of catastrophic forgetting. While point clouds are common, we observe high similarity and unclear boundaries between different classes. Meanwhile, they are known to be imbalanced in class distribution. These lead to issues including misclassification between similar classes and the long-tail problem, which have not been adequately addressed in previous CIL methods. We thus propose ProtoGuard and PROPEL (Progressive Refinement Of PsEudo-Labels). In the base-class training phase, ProtoGuard maintains geometric and semantic prototypes for each class, which are combined into prototype features using an attention mechanism. In the novel-class training phase, PROPEL inherits the base feature extractor and classifier, guiding pseudo-label propagation and updates based on density distribution and semantic similarity. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves remarkable results on both the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets, improving the mIoU of 3D point cloud segmentation by a maximum of 20.39% under the 5-step CIL scenario on S3DIS.</p></details> |  | None |

While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates label scarcity in PCSS, existing methods critically overlook the inherent vulnerability to real-world perturbations (e.g., snow, fog, rain) and adversarial distortions. This work first identifies two intrinsic limitations that undermine current PCSS-UDA robustness: (a) unsupervised features overlap from unaligned boundaries in shared-class regions and (b) feature structure erosion caused by domain-invariant learning that suppresses target-specific patterns. To address the proposed problems, we propose a tripartite framework consisting of: 1) a robustness evaluation model quantifying resilience against adversarial attack/corruption types through robustness metrics; 2) an invertible attention alignment module (IAAM) enabling bidirectional domain mapping while preserving discriminative structure via attention-guided overlap suppression; and 3) a contrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning that progressively refines pseudo-labels with feature quality for more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on SynLiDAR-to-SemanticPOSS adaptation demonstrate a maximum mIoU improvement of 14.3\% under adversarial attack.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures | None |

However, existing works overlook adversarial robustness when the source domain itself is compromised. To comprehensively explore the robustness of the UDA frameworks, we first design a stealthy adversarial point cloud generation attack that can significantly contaminate datasets with only minor perturbations to the point cloud surface. Based on that, we propose a novel dataset, AdvSynLiDAR, comprising synthesized contaminated LiDAR point clouds. With the generated corrupted data, we further develop the Adversarial Adaptation Framework (AAF) as the countermeasure. Specifically, by extending the key point sensitive (KPS) loss towards the Robust Long-Tail loss (RLT loss) and utilizing a decoder branch, our approach enables the model to focus on long-tail classes during the pre-training phase and leverages high-confidence decoded point cloud information to restore point cloud structures during the adaptation phase. We evaluated our AAF method on the AdvSynLiDAR dataset, where the results demonstrate that our AAF method can mitigate performance degradation under source adversarial perturbations for UDA in the 3D point cloud segmentation application.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models present several critical limitations that hinder their practical application in civil engineering(CE). Primarily, their ability to recognize damage types remains constrained, preventing comprehensive analysis of the highly varied and complex conditions encountered in real-world CE structures. Second, these models lack linguistic capabilities, rendering them unable to articulate structural damage characteristics through natural language descriptions. With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence(AI), large multi-modal models(LMMs) have emerged as a transformative solution, enabling the unified encoding and alignment of textual and visual data. These models can autonomously generate detailed descriptive narratives of structural damage while demonstrating robust generalization across diverse scenarios and tasks. This study introduces SDIGLM, an innovative LMM for structural damage identification, developed based on the open-source VisualGLM-6B architecture. To address the challenge of adapting LMMs to the intricate and varied operating conditions in CE, this work integrates a U-Net-based semantic segmentation module to generate defect segmentation maps as visual Chain of Thought(CoT). Additionally, a multi-round dialogue fine-tuning dataset is constructed to enhance logical reasoning, complemented by a language CoT formed through prompt engineering. By leveraging this multi-modal CoT, SDIGLM surpasses general-purpose LMMs in structural damage identification, achieving an accuracy of 95.24% across various infrastructure types. Moreover, the model effectively describes damage characteristics such as hole size, crack direction, and corrosion severity.</p></details> |  | None |

Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CSS) requires incrementally learning new semantic categories while retaining prior knowledge. Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive training based on stochastic gradient descent, employing complex regularization or exemplar replay. However, stochastic gradient descent-based approaches inevitably update the model's weights for past knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting, a problem exacerbated by pixel/point-level granularity. To address these challenges, we propose CFSSeg, a novel exemplar-free approach that leverages a closed-form solution, offering a practical and theoretically grounded solution for continual semantic segmentation tasks. This eliminates the need for iterative gradient-based optimization and storage of past data, requiring only a single pass through new samples per step. It not only enhances computational efficiency but also provides a practical solution for dynamic, privacy-sensitive multimedia environments. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D benchmark datasets such as Pascal VOC2012, S3DIS, and ScanNet demonstrate CFSSeg's superior performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Then we leverage LMMs to extract essential semantic components, including overall descriptions, object detailed description, and semantic segmentation masks. We propose a training-free Object Restoration model with Attention Guidance (ORAG) built on pre-trained ControlNet to restore object details conditioned by object-level text descriptions and semantic masks. Based on the proposed ORAG, we design a multistage semantic image decoder to progressively restore the details object by object, starting from the extremely compressed reference image, ultimately generating high-quality and high-fidelity reconstructions. Experimental results demonstrate that SEDIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency at extremely low-bitrates ($\le$ 0.05 bpp).</p></details> |  | None |

As those mask patterns resort to different criteria to depict image contents, sticking to a fixed pattern leads to a limited vision cues modeling capability.This paper introduces an evolved hierarchical masking method to pursue general visual cues modeling in self-supervised learning. The proposed method leverages the vision model being trained to parse the input visual cues into a hierarchy structure, which is hence adopted to generate masks accordingly. The accuracy of hierarchy is on par with the capability of the model being trained, leading to evolved mask patterns at different training stages. Initially, generated masks focus on low-level visual cues to grasp basic textures, then gradually evolve to depict higher-level cues to reinforce the learning of more complicated object semantics and contexts. Our method does not require extra pre-trained models or annotations and ensures training efficiency by evolving the training difficulty. We conduct extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks including partial-duplicate image retrieval relying on low-level details, as well as image classification and semantic segmentation that require semantic parsing capability. Experimental results demonstrate that it substantially boosts performance across these tasks. For instance, it surpasses the recent MAE by 1.1\% in imageNet-1K classification and 1.4\% in ADE20K segmentation with the same training epochs. We also align the proposed method with the current research focus on LLMs. The proposed approach bridges the gap with large-scale pre-training on semantic demanding tasks and enhances intricate detail perception in tasks requiring low-level feature recognition.</p></details> |  | None |

While Offline Reinforcement Learning enables the training of autonomous vehicles using such data, most available datasets lack meaningful reward labels. Reward labeling is essential as it provides feedback for the learning algorithm to distinguish between desirable and undesirable behaviors, thereby improving policy performance. This paper presents a novel pipeline for generating human-aligned reward labels. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of absent reward signals in real-world datasets by generating labels that reflect human judgment and safety considerations. The pipeline incorporates an adaptive safety component, activated by analyzing semantic segmentation maps, allowing the autonomous vehicle to prioritize safety over efficiency in potential collision scenarios. The proposed pipeline is applied to an occluded pedestrian crossing scenario with varying levels of pedestrian traffic, using synthetic and simulation data. The results indicate that the generated reward labels closely match the simulation reward labels. When used to train the driving policy using Behavior Proximal Policy Optimisation, the results are competitive with other baselines. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in producing reliable and human-aligned reward signals, facilitating the training of autonomous driving systems through Reinforcement Learning outside of simulation environments and in alignment with human values.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

Specifically, our approach, namely NCLR, focuses on 2D-3D neural calibration, a novel pretext task that estimates the rigid pose aligning camera and LiDAR coordinate systems. First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching. Second, we identify the overlapping area between the image and point cloud with the fused features. Third, we establish dense 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the rigid pose. The framework not only learns fine-grained matching from points to pixels but also achieves alignment of the image and point cloud at a holistic level, understanding their relative pose. We demonstrate the efficacy of NCLR by applying the pre-trained backbone to downstream tasks, such as LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets illustrate the superiority of NCLR over existing self-supervised methods.

However, most existing approaches do not reconstruct semantic labels, which are crucial for many downstream applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception.

To address this challenge, we propose SN-LiDAR, a method that jointly performs accurate semantic segmentation, high-quality geometric reconstruction, and realistic LiDAR synthesis. Specifically, we employ a coarse-to-fine planar-grid feature representation to extract global features from multi-frame point clouds and leverage a CNN-based encoder to extract local semantic features from the current frame point cloud.

| **[DSM: Building A Diverse Semantic Map for 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08307v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, with the growing research and application of multimodal large language models (VLMs) in robotics, there has been an increasing trend of utilizing VLMs for robotic scene understanding tasks. Existing approaches that use VLMs for 3D Visual Grounding tasks often focus on obtaining scene information through geometric and visual information, overlooking the extraction of diverse semantic information from the scene and the understanding of rich implicit semantic attributes, such as appearance, physics, and affordance. The 3D scene graph, which combines geometry and language, is an ideal representation method for environmental perception and is an effective carrier for language models in 3D Visual Grounding tasks. To address these issues, we propose a diverse semantic map construction method specifically designed for robotic agents performing 3D Visual Grounding tasks. This method leverages VLMs to capture the latent semantic attributes and relations of objects within the scene and creates a Diverse Semantic Map (DSM) through a geometry sliding-window map construction strategy. We enhance the understanding of grounding information based on DSM and introduce a novel approach named DSM-Grounding. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current approaches in tasks like semantic segmentation and 3D Visual Grounding, particularly excelling in overall metrics compared to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we have deployed this method on robots to validate its effectiveness in navigation and grasping tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IROS, Project Page: https://binicey.github.io/DSM</p></details> | [Code Link](https://binicey.github.io/DSM) |

To address the high computational costs of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, this paper introduces TwinLiteNetPlus, a model capable of balancing efficiency and accuracy. TwinLiteNetPlus incorporates standard and depth-wise separable dilated convolutions, reducing complexity while maintaining high accuracy. It is available in four configurations, from the robust 1.94 million-parameter TwinLiteNetPlus_{Large} to the ultra-lightweight 34K-parameter TwinLiteNetPlus_{Nano}. Notably, TwinLiteNetPlus_{Large} attains a 92.9% mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) for Drivable Area Segmentation and a 34.2% IoU (Intersection over Union) for Lane Segmentation. These results achieve remarkable performance, surpassing current state-of-the-art models while only requiring 11 times fewer Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) for computation. Rigorously evaluated on various embedded devices, TwinLiteNetPlus demonstrates promising latency and power efficiency, underscoring its potential for real-world autonomous vehicle applications.

While semantic segmentation of realistic humans has recently advanced considerably, existing models often fail when confronted with the abstract, representational nature of childlike drawings. This semantic understanding is a crucial prerequisite for animation tools that seek to modify figures while preserving their unique style. To help achieve this, we propose a novel hierarchical segmentation model, built upon the architecture and pre-trained SAM, to quickly and accurately obtain these semantic labels. Our model achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art segmentation models focused on realistic humans and cartoon figures, even after fine-tuning. We demonstrate the value of our model for semantic segmentation through multiple applications: a fully automatic facial animation pipeline, a figure relighting pipeline, improvements to an existing childlike human figure drawing animation method, and generalization to out-of-domain figures. Finally, to support future work in this area, we introduce a dataset of 16,000 childlike drawings with pixel-level annotations across 25 semantic categories. Our work can enable entirely new, easily accessible tools for hand-drawn character animation, and our dataset can enable new lines of inquiry in a variety of graphics and human-centric research fields.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most of the existing work focuses on the fully supervised setting, training networks on large annotated datasets. In this work, we present RendBEV, a new method for the self-supervised training of BEV semantic segmentation networks, leveraging differentiable volumetric rendering to receive supervision from semantic perspective views computed by a 2D semantic segmentation model. Our method enables zero-shot BEV semantic segmentation, and already delivers competitive results in this challenging setting. When used as pretraining to then fine-tune on labeled BEV ground-truth, our method significantly boosts performance in low-annotation regimes, and sets a new state of the art when fine-tuning on all available labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> | None |

Training data for perception systems cannot cover the wide variety of objects that may appear during deployment. Thus, reliable identification of unknown objects, such as wild animals and untypical obstacles, is critical due to their potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been facilitated by the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. However, a comprehensive understanding of scene dynamics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Development in this area has been lagging, largely due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks. The situation is similar in object detection. While there is interest in detecting and potentially tracking every anomalous object, the availability of dedicated benchmarks is clearly limited. To address this gap, this work extends some commonly used anomaly segmentation benchmarks to include the instance segmentation and object detection tasks. Our evaluation of anomaly instance segmentation and object detection methods shows that both of these challenges remain unsolved problems.

However, these methods overlook the diverse knowledge contained in architectures with different inductive biases, which is crucial for enabling the student to acquire a more precise and comprehensive understanding of the data during distillation. To this end, we propose for the first time a generic knowledge distillation method for semantic segmentation from a heterogeneous perspective, named HeteroAKD. Due to the substantial disparities between heterogeneous architectures, such as CNN and Transformer, directly transferring cross-architecture knowledge presents significant challenges. To eliminate the influence of architecture-specific information, the intermediate features of both the teacher and student are skillfully projected into an aligned logits space. Furthermore, to utilize diverse knowledge from heterogeneous architectures and deliver customized knowledge required by the student, a teacher-student knowledge mixing mechanism (KMM) and a teacher-student knowledge evaluation mechanism (KEM) are introduced. These mechanisms are performed by assessing the reliability and its discrepancy between heterogeneous teacher-student knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on three main-stream benchmarks using various teacher-student pairs demonstrate that our HeteroAKD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods in facilitating distillation between heterogeneous architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite notable progress, a significant gap persists between research and real-world deployment due to variability and uncertainty in multi-modal data quality. Robustness has thus become essential for practical MMSS applications. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks for evaluating robustness hinders further advancement. To address this, we first survey existing MMSS literature and categorize representative methods to provide a structured overview. We then introduce a robustness benchmark that evaluates MMSS models under three scenarios: Entire-Missing Modality (EMM), Random-Missing Modality (RMM), and Noisy Modality (NM). From a probabilistic standpoint, we model modality failure under two conditions: (1) all damaged combinations are equally probable; (2) each modality fails independently following a Bernoulli distribution. Based on these, we propose four metrics-$mIoU^{Avg}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{E}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{Avg}_{RMM}$, and $mIoU^{E}_{RMM}$-to assess model robustness under EMM and RMM. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark for MMSS robustness, offering new insights and tools to advance the field.

However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements. We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern. Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective. IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS. In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning, rely on low-resolution images, and offer limited interpretability in attention mechanisms. To address these challenges, we introduce RadZero, a novel similarity-based cross-attention framework for vision-language alignment in radiology with zero-shot multi-task capability. RadZero leverages large language models to extract minimal semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs a multi-positive contrastive learning strategy to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It also utilizes a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, RadZero enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification and pixel-level cross-modal similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, cross-modal similarity map analysis highlights its potential for improving explainability in vision-language alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

Current mapping approaches either are limited by the depth range or only map beyond-range entities in constrained settings, where overall they fail to combine within-range and beyond-range observations. Furthermore, these methods make a trade-off between fine-grained semantics and efficiency. We introduce RayFronts, a unified representation that enables both dense and beyond-range efficient semantic mapping. RayFronts encodes task-agnostic open-set semantics to both in-range voxels and beyond-range rays encoded at map boundaries, empowering the robot to reduce search volumes significantly and make informed decisions both within & beyond sensory range, while running at 8.84 Hz on an Orin AGX. Benchmarking the within-range semantics shows that RayFronts's fine-grained image encoding provides 1.34x zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation performance while improving throughput by 16.5x. Traditionally, online mapping performance is entangled with other system components, complicating evaluation. We propose a planner-agnostic evaluation framework that captures the utility for online beyond-range search and exploration, and show RayFronts reduces search volume 2.2x more efficiently than the closest online baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Domain Generalization through Attenuation of Domain-Specific Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06781v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metric called Domain Independence (DI) and Attenuation of Domain-Specific Information (ADSI) which is specifically designed for domain-generalized semantic segmentation in automotive images. DI measures the presence of domain-specific information: a lower DI value indicates strong domain dependence, while a higher DI value suggests greater domain independence. This makes it roughly where domain-specific information exists and up to which frequency range it is present. As a result, it becomes possible to effectively suppress only the regions in the image that contain domain-specific information, enabling feature extraction independent of the domain. ADSI uses a Butterworth filter to remove the low-frequency components of images that contain inherent domain-specific information such as sensor characteristics and lighting conditions. However, since low-frequency components also contain important information such as color, we should not remove them completely. Thus, a scalar value (ranging from 0 to 1) is multiplied by the low-frequency components to retain essential information. This helps the model learn more domain-independent features. In experiments, GTA5 (synthetic dataset) was used as training images, and a real-world dataset was used for evaluation, and the proposed method outperformed conventional approaches. Similarly, in experiments that the Cityscapes (real-world dataset) was used for training and various environment datasets such as rain and nighttime were used for evaluation, the proposed method demonstrated its robustness under nighttime conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 Workshops</p></details> | None |

Existing methods often suffer from coupling, where over-reliance on initial labeled data leads to suboptimal learning; confirmation bias, where incorrect predictions reinforce themselves repeatedly; and boundary blur caused by limited boundary-awareness and ambiguous edge cues. To address these issues, we propose CW-BASS, a novel framework for SSSS. In order to mitigate the impact of incorrect predictions, we assign confidence weights to pseudo-labels. Additionally, we leverage boundary-delineation techniques, which, despite being extensively explored in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), remain underutilized in SSSS. Specifically, our method: (1) reduces coupling via a confidence-weighted loss that adjusts pseudo-label influence based on their predicted confidence scores, (2) mitigates confirmation bias with a dynamic thresholding mechanism that learns to filter out pseudo-labels based on model performance, (3) tackles boundary blur using a boundary-aware module to refine segmentation near object edges, and (4) reduces label noise through a confidence decay strategy that progressively refines pseudo-labels during training. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes demonstrate that CW-BASS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, CW-BASS achieves a 65.9% mIoU on Cityscapes under a challenging and underexplored 1/30 (3.3%) split (100 images), highlighting its effectiveness in limited-label settings.

However, we have observed that existing PEFT methods, which are often designed with natural imagery in mind, struggle when applied to Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios. This is primarily due to their inability to handle artifact influences, a problem particularly severe in RS image features. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Earth-Adapter, the first PEFT method specifically designed for RS artifacts conquering. Earth-Adapter introduces a novel Mixture of Frequency Adaptation process that combines a Mixture of Adapter (MoA) with Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT). By utilizing DFT, Earth-Adapter can decompose features into different frequency components, precisely separating artifacts from original features. The MoA then dynamically assigns weights to each adapter expert, allowing for the combination of features across various frequency domains. These simple-yet-effective approaches enable Earth-Adapter to more efficiently overcome the disturbances caused by artifacts than previous PEFT methods, significantly enhancing the FMs' performance on RS scenarios. Experiments on Domain Adaptation (DA), and Domain Generalization (DG) semantic segmentation benchmarks showcase the Earth-Adapter's effectiveness. Compared with baseline Rein, Earth-Adapter significantly improves 9.0% mIoU in DA and 3.1% mIoU in DG benchmarks.

We present a decoupled 3D segmentation pipeline to ensure modularity and adaptability to novel 3D representations as well as semantic segmentation foundation models. We first reconstruct a scene with 3D Gaussians and learn class-agnostic features through contrastive supervision from a 2D instance proposal network. These 3D features are then clustered to form coarse object- or part-level masks. Finally, we match each 3D cluster to class-aware masks predicted by a 2D open-vocabulary segmentation model, assigning semantic labels without retraining the 3D representation. Our decoupled design (1) provides a plug-and-play interface for swapping different 2D or 3D modules, (2) ensures multi-object instance segmentation at no extra cost, and (3) leverages rich 3D geometry for robust scene understanding. We evaluate on synthetic and real-world indoor datasets, demonstrating improved performance over comparable NeRF-based pipelines on mIoU and mAcc, particularly for challenging or long-tail classes. We also show how varying the 2D backbone affects the final segmentation, highlighting the modularity of our framework. These results confirm that decoupling 3D mask proposal and semantic classification can deliver flexible, efficient, and open-vocabulary 3D segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CVPR Workshop on Open-World 3D Scene Understanding with Foundation Models</p></details> | None |

Although intuitive, a simple amalgamation of DA and SSL is suboptimal in semantic segmentation due to two major reasons: (1) previous methods, while able to learn good segmentation boundaries, are prone to confuse classes with similar visual appearance due to limited supervision; and (2) skewed and imbalanced training data distribution preferring source representation learning whereas impeding from exploring limited information about tailed classes. Language guidance can serve as a pivotal semantic bridge, facilitating robust class discrimination and mitigating visual ambiguities by leveraging the rich semantic relationships encoded in pre-trained language models to enhance feature representations across domains. Therefore, we propose the first language-guided SSDA setting for semantic segmentation in this work. Specifically, we harness the semantic generalization capabilities inherent in vision-language models (VLMs) to establish a synergistic framework within the SSDA paradigm. To address the inherent class-imbalance challenges in long-tailed distributions, we introduce class-balanced segmentation loss formulations that effectively regularize the learning process.

Automated wound monitoring via mobile image capture can reduce in-person physician visits by enabling remote tracking of wound size. Semantic segmentation is key to this process, yet wound segmentation remains underrepresented in medical imaging research. To address this, we benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models from general-purpose vision, medical imaging, and top methods from public wound challenges. For fair comparison, we standardize training, data augmentation, and evaluation, conducting cross-validationto minimize partitioning bias. We also assess real-world deployment aspects, including generalization to an out-of-distribution wound dataset, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a reference object-based approach to convert AI-generated masks into clinically relevant wound size estimates, and evaluate this, along with mask quality, for the best models based on physician assessments. Overall, the transformer-based TransNeXt showed the highest levels of generalizability. Despite variations in inference times, all models processed at least one image per second on the CPU, which is deemed adequate for the intended application. Interpretability analysis typically revealed prominent activations in wound regions, emphasizing focus on clinically relevant features. Expert evaluation showed high mask approval for all analyzed models, with VWFormer and ConvNeXtS backbone performing the best. Size retrieval accuracy was similar across models, and predictions closely matched expert annotations.

However, most existing works over-trusted SAM to regularize image-level CLIP without any further refinement. Moreover, several existing works improved efficiency by dimensionality reduction of semantic features from 2D VLMs before fusing with 3DGS semantic fields, which inevitably leads to multi-view inconsistency. In this work, we propose econSG for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with 3DGS. Our econSG consists of: 1) A Confidence-region Guided Regularization (CRR) that mutually refines SAM and CLIP to get the best of both worlds for precise semantic features with complete and precise boundaries. 2) A low dimensional contextual space to enforce 3D multi-view consistency while improving computational efficiency by fusing backprojected multi-view 2D features and follow by dimensional reduction directly on the fused 3D features instead of operating on each 2D view separately. Our econSG shows state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets compared to the existing methods.

However, most existing visual Mamba methods flatten images into 1D sequences using predefined scan orders, which results the model being less capable of utilizing the spatial structural information of the image during the feature extraction process. To address this issue, we proposed a novel visual foundation model called DefMamba. This model includes a multi-scale backbone structure and deformable mamba (DM) blocks, which dynamically adjust the scanning path to prioritize important information, thus enhancing the capture and processing of relevant input features. By combining a deformable scanning(DS) strategy, this model significantly improves its ability to learn image structures and detects changes in object details. Numerous experiments have shown that DefMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in various visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target domains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention mechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to key objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture, scale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive Cluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images into structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized transferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA) module that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs' attention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low transferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across 20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2% MIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Balancing Robustness and Efficiency in Embedded DNNs Through Activation Function Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05119v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning-based embedded systems for safety-critical applications, such as aerospace and autonomous driving, must be robust to perturbations caused by soft errors. As transistor geometries shrink and voltages decrease, modern electronic devices become more susceptible to background radiation, increasing the concern about failures produced by soft errors. The resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target device technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation and arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like pruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error robustness. In this regard, although often overlooked, the choice of activation functions (AFs) impacts not only accuracy and trainability but also compressibility and error resilience. This paper explores the use of bounded AFs to enhance robustness against parameter perturbations, while evaluating their effects on model accuracy, compressibility, and computational load with a technology-agnostic approach. We focus on encoder-decoder convolutional models developed for semantic segmentation of hyperspectral images with application to autonomous driving systems. Experiments are conducted on an AMD-Xilinx's KV260 SoM.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Prompt Categories Cluster for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13823v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which leverages image-level labels, has garnered significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness. The previous methods mainly strengthen the inter-class differences to avoid class semantic ambiguity which may lead to erroneous activation. However, they overlook the positive function of some shared information between similar classes. Categories within the same cluster share some similar features. Allowing the model to recognize these features can further relieve the semantic ambiguity between these classes. To effectively identify and utilize this shared information, in this paper, we introduce a novel WSSS framework called Prompt Categories Clustering (PCC). Specifically, we explore the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters through prompts. These clusters effectively represent the intrinsic relationships between categories. By integrating this relational information into the training network, our model is able to better learn the hidden connections between categories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing its ability to enhance performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 ELVM</p></details> | None |
