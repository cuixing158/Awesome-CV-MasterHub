| **[LogoSP: Local-global Grouping of Superpoints for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07857v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the absence of human labels during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[F2Net: A Frequency-Fused Network for Ultra-High Resolution Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07847v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39, respectively. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Trend-Aware Fashion Recommendation with Visual Segmentation and Semantic Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07773v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a trend-aware and visually-grounded fashion recommendation system that integrates deep visual representations, garment-aware segmentation, semantic category similarity and user behavior simulation. Our pipeline extracts focused visual embeddings by masking non-garment regions via semantic segmentation followed by feature extraction using pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16). To simulate realistic shopping behavior, we generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95% category similarity and lowest popularity MAE. An ablation study confirms the complementary roles of visual and popularity cues. Our method provides a scalable framework for personalized fashion recommendations that balances individual style with emerging trends.

| **[ComPtr: Towards Diverse Bi-source Dense Prediction Tasks via A Simple yet General Complementary Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12349v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has advanced the field of dense prediction, while gradually dissolving the inherent barriers between different tasks. However, most existing works focus on designing architectures and constructing visual cues only for the specific task, which ignores the potential uniformity introduced by the DL paradigm. In this paper, we attempt to construct a novel $\underline{ComP}$lementary $\underline{tr}$ansformer, $\textbf{ComPtr}$, for diverse bi-source dense prediction tasks. Specifically, unlike existing methods that over-specialize in a single task or a subset of tasks, ComPtr starts from the more general concept of bi-source dense prediction. Based on the basic dependence on information complementarity, we propose consistency enhancement and difference awareness components with which ComPtr can evacuate and collect important visual semantic cues from different image sources for diverse tasks, respectively. ComPtr treats different inputs equally and builds an efficient dense interaction model in the form of sequence-to-sequence on top of the transformer. This task-generic design provides a smooth foundation for constructing the unified model that can simultaneously deal with various bi-source information. In extensive experiments across several representative vision tasks, i.e. remote sensing change detection, RGB-T crowd counting, RGB-D/T salient object detection, and RGB-D semantic segmentation, the proposed method consistently obtains favorable performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr) |
| **[Baseline Systems and Evaluation Metrics for Spatial Semantic Segmentation of Sound Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22088v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Immersive communication has made significant advancements, especially with the release of the codec for Immersive Voice and Audio Services. Aiming at its further realization, the DCASE 2025 Challenge has recently introduced a task for spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5), which focuses on detecting and separating sound events in spatial sound scenes. In this paper, we explore methods for addressing the S5 task. Specifically, we present baseline S5 systems that combine audio tagging (AT) and label-queried source separation (LSS) models. We investigate two LSS approaches based on the ResUNet architecture: a) extracting a single source for each detected event and b) querying multiple sources concurrently. Since each separated source in S5 is identified by its sound event class label, we propose new class-aware metrics to evaluate both the sound sources and labels simultaneously. Experimental results on first-order ambisonics spatial audio demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed systems and confirm the efficacy of the metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05369v7)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dilated convolution, which expands the receptive field by inserting gaps between its consecutive elements, is widely employed in computer vision. In this study, we propose three strategies to improve individual phases of dilated convolution from the view of spectrum analysis. Departing from the conventional practice of fixing a global dilation rate as a hyperparameter, we introduce Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution (FADC), which dynamically adjusts dilation rates spatially based on local frequency components. Subsequently, we design two plug-in modules to directly enhance effective bandwidth and receptive field size. The Adaptive Kernel (AdaKern) module decomposes convolution weights into low-frequency and high-frequency components, dynamically adjusting the ratio between these components on a per-channel basis. By increasing the high-frequency part of convolution weights, AdaKern captures more high-frequency components, thereby improving effective bandwidth. The Frequency Selection (FreqSelect) module optimally balances high- and low-frequency components in feature representations through spatially variant reweighting. It suppresses high frequencies in the background to encourage FADC to learn a larger dilation, thereby increasing the receptive field for an expanded scope. Extensive experiments on segmentation and object detection consistently validate the efficacy of our approach. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FADC.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 highlighted</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FADC) |
| **[Adapter Naturally Serves as Decoupler for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07376v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler. Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information. Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN), which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Spotlight | None |
| **[Multiple Object Stitching for Unsupervised Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07364v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence, compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations. In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised representation performance on both single object centric images and multi-object ones.

| **[BRIGHT+: Upgrading the BRIGHT Benchmark with MARCUS, a Multi-Agent RAG Clean-Up Suite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07116v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean. In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Group-On: Boosting One-Shot Segmentation with Supportive Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11871v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot semantic segmentation aims to segment query images given only ONE annotated support image of the same class. This task is challenging because target objects in the support and query images can be largely different in appearance and pose (i.e., intra-class variation). Prior works suggested that incorporating more annotated support images in few-shot settings boosts performances but increases costs due to additional manual labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach for ONE-shot semantic segmentation, called Group-On, which packs multiple query images in batches for the benefit of mutual knowledge support within the same category. Specifically, after coarse segmentation masks of the batch of queries are predicted, query-mask pairs act as pseudo support data to enhance mask predictions mutually. To effectively steer such process, we construct an innovative MoME module, where a flexible number of mask experts are guided by a scene-driven router and work together to make comprehensive decisions, fully promoting mutual benefits of queries. Comprehensive experiments on three standard benchmarks show that, in the ONE-shot setting, Group-On significantly outperforms previous works by considerable margins. With only one annotated support image, Group-On can be even competitive with the counterparts using 5 annotated images.</p></details> |  | None |

This challenge focuses on semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds from diverse unstructured outdoor environments collected from multiple robotic platforms. This problem was addressed by implementing Point Prompt Tuning (PPT) integrated with Point Transformer v3 (PTv3) backbone, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous LiDAR data through platform-specific conditioning and cross-dataset class alignment strategies. The model is trained without requiring additional external data. As a result, this approach achieved substantial performance improvements with mIoU increases of up to 22.59% on challenging platforms compared to the baseline PTv3 model, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive point cloud understanding for field robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Winne...</summary><p>Winner of the GOOSE 3D Semantic Segmentation Challenge at the IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[RT-GuIDE: Real-Time Gaussian splatting for Information-Driven Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18122v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for active mapping and exploration that leverages Gaussian splatting for constructing dense maps. Further, we develop a GPU-accelerated motion planning algorithm that can exploit the Gaussian map for real-time navigation. The Gaussian map constructed onboard the robot is optimized for both photometric and geometric quality while enabling real-time situational awareness for autonomy. We show through simulation experiments that our method yields comparable Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and similar reconstruction error to state-of-the-art approaches, while being orders of magnitude faster to compute. In real-world experiments, our algorithm achieves better map quality (at least 0.8dB higher PSNR and more than 16% higher geometric reconstruction accuracy) than maps constructed by a state-of-the-art method, enabling semantic segmentation using off-the-shelf open-set models.

| **[Position Prediction Self-Supervised Learning for Multimodal Satellite Imagery Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06852v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction, encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than reconstruction-based approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EndoARSS: Adapting Spatially-Aware Foundation Model for Efficient Activity Recognition and Semantic Segmentation in Endoscopic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06830v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes, characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2 foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks, significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Advanced Intelligent Systems</p></details> | None |
| **[GS4: Generalizable Sparse Splatting Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06517v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location. Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[NeurNCD: Novel Class Discovery via Implicit Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06412v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering, facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Rethinking Semi-supervised Segmentation Beyond Accuracy: Reliability and Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05917v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models. Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world deployment needs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BOLD: Boolean Logic Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16339v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning is computationally intensive, with significant efforts focused on reducing arithmetic complexity, particularly regarding energy consumption dominated by data movement. While existing literature emphasizes inference, training is considerably more resource-intensive. This paper proposes a novel mathematical principle by introducing the notion of Boolean variation such that neurons made of Boolean weights and inputs can be trained -- for the first time -- efficiently in Boolean domain using Boolean logic instead of gradient descent and real arithmetic. We explore its convergence, conduct extensively experimental benchmarking, and provide consistent complexity evaluation by considering chip architecture, memory hierarchy, dataflow, and arithmetic precision. Our approach achieves baseline full-precision accuracy in ImageNet classification and surpasses state-of-the-art results in semantic segmentation, with notable performance in image super-resolution, and natural language understanding with transformer-based models. Moreover, it significantly reduces energy consumption during both training and inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2024 main conference</p></details> | None |

However, existing approaches fall short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, deep learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically, we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore, cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR image segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Point Cloud Segmentation of Agricultural Vehicles using 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05009v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of 91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[You Only Train Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04349v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO), indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters, which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data.

To enhance out-of-domain generalization, we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to guide the training of the CAT-Seg model.

| **[BiXFormer: A Robust Framework for Maximizing Modality Effectiveness in Multi-Modal Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03675v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing multi-modal data enhances scene understanding by providing complementary semantic and geometric information. Existing methods fuse features or distill knowledge from multiple modalities into a unified representation, improving robustness but restricting each modality's ability to fully leverage its strengths in different situations. We reformulate multi-modal semantic segmentation as a mask-level classification task and propose BiXFormer, which integrates Unified Modality Matching (UMM) and Cross Modality Alignment (CMA) to maximize modality effectiveness and handle missing modalities. Specifically, BiXFormer first categorizes multi-modal inputs into RGB and X, where X represents any non-RGB modalities, e.g., depth, allowing separate processing for each. This design leverages the well-established pretraining for RGB, while addressing the relative lack of attention to X modalities. Then, we propose UMM, which includes Modality Agnostic Matching (MAM) and Complementary Matching (CM). MAM assigns labels to features from all modalities without considering modality differences, leveraging each modality's strengths. CM then reassigns unmatched labels to remaining unassigned features within their respective modalities, ensuring that each available modality contributes to the final prediction and mitigating the impact of missing modalities. Moreover, to further facilitate UMM, we introduce CMA, which enhances the weaker queries assigned in CM by aligning them with optimally matched queries from MAM. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving significant improvements in mIoU of +2.75% and +22.74% over the prior arts.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio, along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike prior generative or physics-based simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including 2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that SA-Radar's simulated data is both realistic and effective, consistently improving model performance when used standalone or in combination with real data. Our framework also supports simulation in novel sensor viewpoints and edited scenes, showcasing its potential as a general-purpose radar data engine for autonomous driving applications.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) excel in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, their application to instance segmentation for autonomous driving remains underexplored and often relies on suboptimal baselines. We introduce UDA4Inst, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through Semantic Category Training and Bidirectional Mixing Training. Semantic Category Training groups semantically related classes for separate training, improving pseudo-label quality and segmentation accuracy. Bidirectional Mixing Training combines instance-wise and patch-wise data mixing, creating coherent composites that enhance generalization across domains. Extensive experiments show UDA4Inst sets a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA-> Cityscapes benchmark (mAP 31.3) and introduces results on novel datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as sources and Cityscapes and KITTI360 as targets.

Unlike prior methods that treat labels as flat and independent, our approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse, label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to 4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%), substantially outperforming existing baselines. Our results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs as knowledge priors in 3D vision and establish hierarchical uncertainty modeling as a powerful paradigm for efficient point cloud annotation.</p></details> |  | None |

With the emergence of vision foundation models (VFM) serving as generalist feature extractors, we seek to explore the adaptation of these models for FSS. While current FSS benchmarks focus on adapting pre-trained models to new tasks with few images, they emphasize in-domain generalization, making them less suitable for VFM trained on large-scale web datasets. To address this, we propose a novel realistic benchmark with a simple and straightforward adaptation process tailored for this task. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of prominent VFM and semantic segmentation models. To evaluate their effectiveness, we leverage various adaption methods, ranging from linear probing to parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning. Our findings show that models designed for segmentation can be outperformed by self-supervised (SSL) models. On the other hand, while PEFT methods yields competitive performance, they provide little discrepancy in the obtained results compared to other methods, highlighting the critical role of the feature extractor in determining results. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the adaptation of VFM for FSS.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in certain highly dynamic scenarios, the detection boxes or segmentation masks cannot fully cover dynamic regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and efficient GeneA-SLAM2 system that leverages depth variance constraints to handle dynamic scenes. Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects. Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Our system was evaluated on multiple highly dynamic sequences. The results demonstrate that GeneA-SLAM2 maintains high accuracy in dynamic scenes compared to current methods.

While existing vision transformers demonstrate promising performance, they often utilize high-resolution context modeling, resulting in a computational bottleneck. In this work, we challenge conventional wisdom and introduce the Low-Resolution Self-Attention (LRSA) mechanism to capture global context at a significantly reduced computational cost, i.e., FLOPs. Our approach involves computing self-attention in a fixed low-resolution space regardless of the input image's resolution, with additional 3x3 depth-wise convolutions to capture fine details in the high-resolution space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our LRSA approach by building the LRFormer, a vision transformer with an encoder-decoder structure. Extensive experiments on the ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that LRFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Recent methods addressing this issue focus on enhancing training data through weather simulation or universal augmentation techniques. However, few works have studied the negative impacts caused by the heterogeneous domain shifts in the geometric structure and reflectance intensity of point clouds. In this paper, we delve into this challenge and address it with a novel Geometry-Reflectance Collaboration (GRC) framework that explicitly separates feature extraction for geometry and reflectance. Specifically, GRC employs a dual-branch architecture designed to independently process geometric and reflectance features initially, thereby capitalizing on their distinct characteristic. Then, GRC adopts a robust multi-level feature collaboration module to suppress redundant and unreliable information from both branches. Consequently, without complex simulation or augmentation, our method effectively extracts intrinsic information about the scene while suppressing interference, thus achieving better robustness and generalization in adverse weather conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GRC through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, showing that our method outperforms previous approaches and establishes new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/sab3r/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/sab3r) |

However, many previous state-of-the-art methods either have to discard intricate local semantic features or suffer from high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a new Few-shot Semantic Segmentation framework based on the Transformer architecture. Our approach introduces the spatial transformer decoder and the contextual mask generation module to improve the relational understanding between support and query images. Moreover, we introduce a multi scale decoder to refine the segmentation mask by incorporating features from different resolutions in a hierarchical manner. Additionally, our approach integrates global features from intermediate encoder stages to improve contextual understanding, while maintaining a lightweight structure to reduce complexity. This balance between performance and efficiency enables our method to achieve competitive results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Notably, our model with only 1.5 million parameters demonstrates competitive performance while overcoming limitations of existing methodologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Most state-of-the-art VSN models are trained in simulation environments, where rendered scenes of the real world are used, at best. These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to domain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose SEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main visual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's perception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating high-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies that improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and real world settings. We also introduce a newly curated dataset, i.e. the SEMNAV dataset, designed for training semantic segmentation-aware navigation models like SEMNAV. Our approach is evaluated extensively in both simulated environments and with real-world robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMNAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art VSN models, achieving higher success rates in the Habitat 2.0 simulation environment, using the HM3D dataset. Furthermore, our real-world experiments highlight the effectiveness of semantic segmentation in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, making our model a promising solution for practical VSN-based robotic applications.

In contrast, contrastive representation learning frameworks typically bypass this explicit multi-stage approach, defining their objective as the direct learning of a semantic representation space for objects. While effective in general contexts, this approach sacrifices the inductive biases of vision, leading to slower convergence speed and learning shortcut resulting in texture bias. In this work, we demonstrate that leveraging Marr's multi-stage theory-by first constructing boundary and surface-level representations using perceptual constructs from early visual processing stages and subsequently training for object semantics-leads to 2x faster convergence on ResNet18, improved final representations on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object recognition, and enhanced robustness and out-of-distribution capability. Together, we propose a pretraining stage before the general contrastive representation pretraining to further enhance the final representation quality and reduce the overall convergence time via inductive bias from human vision systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

However, such SSL approaches often concentrate on employing consistency learning only for individual LiDAR representations. This narrow focus results in limited perturbations that generally fail to enable effective consistency learning. Additionally, these SSL approaches employ contrastive learning based on the sampling from a limited set of positive and negative embedding samples. This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation framework called ItTakesTwo (IT2). IT2 is designed to ensure consistent predictions from peer LiDAR representations, thereby improving the perturbation effectiveness in consistency learning. Furthermore, our contrastive learning employs informative samples drawn from a distribution of positive and negative embeddings learned from the entire training set. Results on public benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the field.

Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

The graph-based method attempts to model the irregular point cloud by representing it as a graph; however, this approach incurs substantial computational cost due to the necessity of constructing a graph for every point within a large-scale point cloud. In this paper, we observe that boundary points possess more intricate spatial structural information and develop a novel graph attention network known as the Boundary-Aware Graph attention Network (BAGNet). On one hand, BAGNet contains a boundary-aware graph attention layer (BAGLayer), which employs edge vertex fusion and attention coefficients to capture features of boundary points, reducing the computation time. On the other hand, BAGNet employs a lightweight attention pooling layer to extract the global feature of the point cloud to maintain model accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that BAGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in point cloud semantic segmentation with higher accuracy and less inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025)</p></details> | None |

Before robot manipulators can generate motion or even build representations of their environments, the cameras rigidly mounted to the robot need to be calibrated. Camera calibration is a cumbersome process involving collecting a set of images, with each capturing a pre-determined marker. In this work, we introduce the Bi-Manual Joint Calibration and Representation Framework (Bi-JCR). Bi-JCR enables multiple robot manipulators, each with cameras mounted, to circumvent taking images of calibration markers. By leveraging 3D foundation models for dense, marker-free multi-view correspondence, Bi-JCR jointly estimates: (i) the extrinsic transformation from each camera to its end-effector, (ii) the inter-arm relative poses between manipulators, and (iii) a unified, scale-consistent 3D representation of the shared workspace, all from the same captured RGB image sets. The representation, jointly constructed from images captured by cameras on both manipulators, lives in a common coordinate frame and supports collision checking and semantic segmentation to facilitate downstream bimanual coordination tasks. We empirically evaluate the robustness of Bi-JCR on a variety of tabletop environments, and demonstrate its applicability on a variety of downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing voxel-based methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation apply uniform partition to the 3D LiDAR point cloud to form a structured representation based on cartesian/cylindrical coordinates. Although these methods show impressive performance, the drawback of existing voxel-based methods remains in two aspects: (1) it requires a large enough input voxel resolution, which brings a large amount of computation cost and memory consumption. (2) it does not well handle the unbalanced point distribution of LiDAR point cloud. In this paper, we propose a non-uniform cylindrical partition network named NUC-Net to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, we propose the Arithmetic Progression of Interval (API) method to non-uniformly partition the radial axis and generate the voxel representation which is representative and efficient. Moreover, we propose a non-uniform multi-scale aggregation method to improve contextual information. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets with much faster speed and much less training time. And our method can be a general component for LiDAR semantic segmentation, which significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of the uniform counterpart by $4 \times$ training faster and $2 \times$ GPU memory reduction and $3 \times$ inference speedup. We further provide theoretical analysis towards understanding why NUC is effective and how point distribution affects performance.

The combination of these multi-modal data enhances environmental perception by providing 3D spatial context, which is absent in standard RGB images. Although RGBD multi-modal data can be available to train computer vision models, accessing all sensor modalities during the inference stage may be infeasible due to sensor failures or resource constraints, leading to a mismatch between data modalities available during training and inference. Traditional Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (CMKD) frameworks, developed to address this task, are typically based on a teacher/student paradigm, where a multi-modal teacher distills knowledge into a single-modality student model. However, these approaches face challenges in teacher architecture choices and distillation process selection, thus limiting their adoption in real-world scenarios. To overcome these issues, we introduce CroDiNo-KD (Cross-Modal Disentanglement: a New Outlook on Knowledge Distillation), a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework for RGBD semantic segmentation. Our approach simultaneously learns single-modality RGB and Depth models by exploiting disentanglement representation, contrastive learning and decoupled data augmentation with the aim to structure the internal manifolds of neural network models through interaction and collaboration. We evaluated CroDiNo-KD on three RGBD datasets across diverse domains, considering recent CMKD frameworks as competitors. Our findings illustrate the quality of CroDiNo-KD, and they suggest reconsidering the conventional teacher/student paradigm to distill information from multi-modal data to single-modality neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous works are mostly built upon class activation maps, which are effective for semantic segmentation but may not be suitable for locating actions and functions. Leveraging recent advanced foundation models, we develop a supervised training pipeline based on pseudo labels. The pseudo labels are generated from an off-the-shelf part segmentation model, guided by a mapping from affordance to part names. Furthermore, we introduce three key enhancements to the baseline model: a label refining stage, a fine-grained feature alignment process, and a lightweight reasoning module. These techniques harness the semantic knowledge of static objects embedded in off-the-shelf foundation models to improve affordance learning, effectively bridging the gap between objects and actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model has achieved a breakthrough improvement over existing methods.

These artifacts, corresponding to high-norm tokens emerging in low-information background areas of images, appear much more severe in Vision Mamba -- they exist prevalently even with the tiny-sized model and activate extensively across background regions. To mitigate this issue, we follow the prior solution of introducing register tokens into Vision Mamba. To better cope with Mamba blocks' uni-directional inference paradigm, two key modifications are introduced: 1) evenly inserting registers throughout the input token sequence, and 2) recycling registers for final decision predictions. We term this new architecture Mamba-R. Qualitative observations suggest, compared to vanilla Vision Mamba, Mamba-R's feature maps appear cleaner and more focused on semantically meaningful regions. Quantitatively, Mamba-R attains stronger performance and scales better. For example, on the ImageNet benchmark, our base-size Mamba-R attains 83.0% accuracy, significantly outperforming Vim-B's 81.8%; furthermore, we provide the first successful scaling to the large model size (i.e., with 341M parameters), attaining a competitive accuracy of 83.6% (84.5% if finetuned with 384x384 inputs).

| **[CAML: Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning for Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17821v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal learning has become a crucial technique for improving the performance of machine learning applications across domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and perception systems. However, in certain scenarios, particularly in resource-constrained environments, some modalities available during training may be absent during inference. While existing frameworks effectively utilize multiple data sources during training and enable inference with reduced modalities, they are primarily designed for single-agent settings. This poses a critical limitation in dynamic environments such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), where incomplete data coverage can lead to decision-making blind spots. Conversely, some works explore multi-agent collaboration but without addressing missing modality at test time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning (CAML), a novel multi-modal multi-agent framework that enables agents to collaborate and share multi-modal data during training, while allowing inference with reduced modalities during testing. Experimental results in collaborative decision-making for CAV in accident-prone scenarios demonstrate that CAML achieves up to a ${\bf 58.1}\%$ improvement in accident detection. Additionally, we validate CAML on real-world aerial-ground robot data for collaborative semantic segmentation, achieving up to a ${\bf 10.6}\%$ improvement in mIoU.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MaskAdapt: Unsupervised Geometry-Aware Domain Adaptation Using Multimodal Contextual Learning and RGB-Depth Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24026v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is crucial for site-specific farm management; however, most existing methods depend on labor intensive pixel-level annotations. A further challenge arises when models trained on one field (source domain) fail to generalize to new fields (target domain) due to domain shifts, such as variations in lighting, camera setups, soil composition, and crop growth stages. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this by enabling adaptation without target-domain labels, but current UDA methods struggle with occlusions and visual blending between crops and weeds, leading to misclassifications in real-world conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MaskAdapt, a novel approach that enhances segmentation accuracy through multimodal contextual learning by integrating RGB images with features derived from depth data. By computing depth gradients from depth maps, our method captures spatial transitions that help resolve texture ambiguities. These gradients, through a cross-attention mechanism, refines RGB feature representations, resulting in sharper boundary delineation. In addition, we propose a geometry-aware masking strategy that applies horizontal, vertical, and stochastic masks during training. This encourages the model to focus on the broader spatial context for robust visual recognition. Evaluations on real agricultural datasets demonstrate that MaskAdapt consistently outperforms existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) UDA methods, achieving improved segmentation mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) across diverse field conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, presented at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025.

This can be attributed to both the comparatively smaller scale of 3D datasets, as well as the disparate sources of the data itself. Point clouds are captured by diverse sensors (e.g., depth cameras, LiDAR) across varied domains (e.g., indoor, outdoor), each introducing unique scanning patterns, sampling densities, and semantic biases. Such domain heterogeneity poses a major barrier towards training unified models at scale, especially under the realistic constraint that domain labels are typically inaccessible at inference time. In this work, we propose Point-MoE, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture designed to enable large-scale, cross-domain generalization in 3D perception. We show that standard point cloud backbones degrade significantly in performance when trained on mixed-domain data, whereas Point-MoE with a simple top-k routing strategy can automatically specialize experts, even without access to domain labels. Our experiments demonstrate that Point-MoE not only outperforms strong multi-domain baselines but also generalizes better to unseen domains. This work highlights a scalable path forward for 3D understanding: letting the model discover structure in diverse 3D data, rather than imposing it via manual curation or domain supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/point-moe/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/point-moe) |

These tokens enable detailed visual understanding while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities. They can be directly applied to various downstream tasks, including open-world semantic segmentation, referring expression comprehension, and grounding. We conduct extensive evaluations and consistently achieve superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods.

However, precise segmentation remains challenging due to complexities in the forest canopy, including shadows, intricate backgrounds, scale variations, and subtle spectral differences among tree species. Compared to the traditional methods, Deep Learning models improve accuracy by extracting informative and discriminative features, but often fall short in capturing the aforementioned complexities. To address these challenges, we propose PerceptiveNet, a novel model incorporating a Logarithmic Gabor-parameterised convolutional layer with trainable filter parameters, alongside a backbone that extracts salient features while capturing extensive context and spatial information through a wider receptive field. We investigate the impact of Log-Gabor, Gabor, and standard convolutional layers on semantic segmentation performance through extensive experimentation. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to assess the contributions of individual layers and their combinations to overall model performance, and we evaluate PerceptiveNet as a backbone within a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer model. Our results outperform state-of-the-art models, demonstrating significant performance improvements on a tree crown dataset while generalising across domains, including two benchmark aerial scene semantic segmentation datasets with varying complexities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) EarthVision</p></details> | None |

To generate high-quality try-on results, accurately warping the clothing item to fit the human body plays a significant role, as slight misalignment may lead to unrealistic artifacts in the fitting image. Most existing methods warp the clothing by feature matching and thin-plate spline (TPS). However, it often fails to preserve clothing details due to self-occlusion, severe misalignment between poses, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a detail retention virtual try-on method via accurate non-rigid registration (VITON-DRR) for diverse human poses. Specifically, we reconstruct a human semantic segmentation using a dual-pyramid-structured feature extractor. Then, a novel Deformation Module is designed for extracting the cloth key points and warping them through an accurate non-rigid registration algorithm. Finally, the Image Synthesis Module is designed to synthesize the deformed garment image and generate the human pose information adaptively. {Compared with} traditional methods, the proposed VITON-DRR can make the deformation of fitting images more accurate and retain more garment details. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, Accepted by Computers & Graphics</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive Spatial Augmentation for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23438v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS), data augmentation plays a crucial role in the weak-to-strong consistency regularization framework, as it enhances diversity and improves model generalization. Recent strong augmentation methods have primarily focused on intensity-based perturbations, which have minimal impact on the semantic masks. In contrast, spatial augmentations like translation and rotation have long been acknowledged for their effectiveness in supervised semantic segmentation tasks, but they are often ignored in SSSS. In this work, we demonstrate that spatial augmentation can also contribute to model training in SSSS, despite generating inconsistent masks between the weak and strong augmentations. Furthermore, recognizing the variability among images, we propose an adaptive augmentation strategy that dynamically adjusts the augmentation for each instance based on entropy. Extensive experiments show that our proposed Adaptive Spatial Augmentation (\textbf{ASAug}) can be integrated as a pluggable module, consistently improving the performance of existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Calibrating Undisciplined Over-Smoothing in Transformer for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03112v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has recently attracted considerable attention because it requires fewer annotations than fully supervised approaches, making it especially promising for large-scale image segmentation tasks. Although many vision transformer-based methods leverage self-attention affinity matrices to refine Class Activation Maps (CAMs), they often treat each layer's affinity equally and thus introduce considerable background noise at deeper layers, where attention tends to converge excessively on certain tokens (i.e., over-smoothing). We observe that this deep-level attention naturally converges on a subset of tokens, yet unregulated query-key affinity can generate unpredictable activation patterns (undisciplined over-smoothing), adversely affecting CAM accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Re-Activation Mechanism (AReAM), which exploits shallow-level affinity to guide deeper-layer convergence in an entropy-aware manner, thereby suppressing background noise and re-activating crucial semantic regions in the CAMs. Experiments on two commonly used datasets demonstrate that AReAM substantially improves segmentation performance compared with existing WSSS methods, reducing noise while sharpening focus on relevant semantic regions. Overall, this work underscores the importance of controlling deep-level attention to mitigate undisciplined over-smoothing, introduces an entropy-aware mechanism that harmonizes shallow and deep-level affinities, and provides a refined approach to enhance transformer-based WSSS accuracy by re-activating CAMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Federated Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23292v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL algorithms under varying client data distributions.

Unfortunately, existing methods often struggle to balance efficiency and performance due to the complexity of feature modeling. Many of these existing approaches are constrained by rigid architectures and implicit representation learning, often characterized by parameter-heavy designs and a reliance on computationally intensive Vision Transformer-based frameworks. In this work, we introduce an efficient paradigm by synergizing explicit and implicit modeling to balance computational efficiency with representational fidelity. Our method combines well-defined Cartesian directions with explicitly modeled views and implicitly inferred intermediate representations, efficiently capturing global dependencies through a nested attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including ADE20K, CityScapes, Pascal Context, and COCO-Stuff, demonstrate that LeMoRe strikes an effective balance between performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |

To solve the aforementioned problems, uncertainty-diffusion-model-based high-Frequency TransFormer network (UDHF2-Net) is the first to be proposed, whose superiorities are as follows: (1) a spatially-stationary-and-non-stationary high-frequency connection paradigm (SHCP) is proposed to enhance the interaction of spatially frequency-wise stationary and non-stationary features to yield high-fidelity edge extraction result. Inspired by HRFormer, SHCP proposes high-frequency-wise stream to replace high-resolution-wise stream in HRFormer through the whole encoder-decoder process with parallel frequency-wise high-to-low streams, so it improves the edge extraction accuracy by continuously remaining high-frequency information; (2) a mask-and-geo-knowledge-based uncertainty diffusion module (MUDM), which is a self-supervised learning strategy, is proposed to improve the edge accuracy of extraction and change detection by gradually removing the simulated spectrum noises based on geo-knowledge and the generated diffused spectrum noises; (3) a frequency-wise semi-pseudo-Siamese UDHF2-Net is the first to be proposed to balance accuracy and complexity for change detection. Besides the aforementioned spectrum noises in semantic segmentation, MUDM is also a self-supervised learning strategy to effectively reduce the edge false change detection from the generated imagery with geometric registration error.</p></details> |  | None |

However, class imbalance and instance imbalance remain persistent challenges, where smaller instances and thin boundaries are often overshadowed by larger structures. To address the multiscale nature of segmented objects, various models have incorporated mechanisms such as spatial attention and feature pyramid networks. Despite these advancements, most loss functions are still primarily pixel-wise, while regional and boundary-focused loss functions often incur high computational costs or are restricted to small-scale regions. To address this limitation, we propose the complex wavelet mutual information (CWMI) loss, a novel loss function that leverages mutual information from subband images decomposed by a complex steerable pyramid. The complex steerable pyramid captures features across multiple orientations and preserves structural similarity across scales. Meanwhile, mutual information is well-suited to capturing high-dimensional directional features and offers greater noise robustness. Extensive experiments on diverse segmentation datasets demonstrate that CWMI loss achieves significant improvements in both pixel-wise accuracy and topological metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, while introducing minimal computational overhead.

| **[Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22458v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. However, traditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and target domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This leads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of category settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low confidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to confusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP: UniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework composed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based Distinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes, enabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the identification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image Matching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels based on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective learning of common classes. We also introduce a new UniDA-SS benchmark and demonstrate through various experiments that UniMAP significantly outperforms baselines.

Coral reef ecological monitoring faces dual challenges of low efficiency in manual analysis and insufficient segmentation accuracy in complex underwater scenarios. This study develops the YH-OSI system, establishing an intelligent framework centered on the Multimodal Large Model (MLLM) for "object detection-semantic segmentation-prior input". The system uses the object detection module (mAP@0.5=0.78) to generate spatial prior boxes for coral instances, driving the segment module to complete pixel-level segmentation in low-light and densely occluded scenarios. The segmentation masks and finetuned classification instructions are fed into the Qwen2-VL-based multimodal model as prior inputs, achieving a genus-level classification accuracy of 88% and simultaneously extracting core ecological metrics. Meanwhile, the system retains the scalability of the multimodal model through standardized interfaces, laying a foundation for future integration into multimodal agent-based underwater robots and supporting the full-process automation of "image acquisition-prior generation-real-time analysis."</p></details> |  | None |

GradTrack comprises two key components: Gaze Track Map Generation and Track Attention, which collaboratively enable progressive feature refinement through multi-level gaze supervision during the decoding process. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG and NCI-ISBI datasets demonstrate that GradTrack consistently outperforms existing gaze-based methods, achieving Dice score improvements of 3.21\% and 2.61\%, respectively.

Traditional methods strive to train models up from scratch, requiring vast amounts of computational resources and training data. In the advent of moving to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which asks models to classify beyond learned categories, large quantities of finely annotated data would be prohibitively expensive. Researchers have instead turned to training-free methods where they leverage existing models made for tasks where data is more easily acquired. Specifically, this survey will cover the history, nuance, idea development and the state-of-the-art in training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that leverages existing multi-modal classification models. We will first give a preliminary on the task definition followed by an overview of popular model archetypes and then spotlight over 30 approaches split into broader research branches: purely CLIP-based, those leveraging auxiliary visual foundation models and ones relying on generative methods. Subsequently, we will discuss the limitations and potential problems of current research, as well as provide some underexplored ideas for future study.

However, the quadratic growth in computational demands as the number of tokens increases limits its practical efficiency. Although recent methods have combined the strengths of convolutions and self-attention to achieve better trade-offs, the expensive pairwise token affinity and complex matrix operations inherent in self-attention remain a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose S2AFormer, an efficient Vision Transformer architecture featuring novel Strip Self-Attention (SSA). We design simple yet effective Hybrid Perception Blocks (HPBs) to effectively integrate the local perception capabilities of CNNs with the global context modeling of Transformer's attention mechanisms. A key innovation of SSA lies in its reducing the spatial dimensions of $K$ and $V$ while compressing the channel dimensions of $Q$ and $K$. This design significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving accuracy, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness. We evaluate the robustness and efficiency of S2AFormer through extensive experiments on multiple vision benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for image classification, ADE20k for semantic segmentation, and COCO for object detection and instance segmentation. Results demonstrate that S2AFormer achieves significant accuracy gains with superior efficiency in both GPU and non-GPU environments, making it a strong candidate for efficient vision Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem is completely overlooked in dense prediction tasks such as Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). In response, we propose a novel TTA method tailored to adapting VLMs for segmentation during test time. Unlike TTA methods for image classification, our Multi-Level and Multi-Prompt (MLMP) entropy minimization integrates features from intermediate vision-encoder layers and is performed with different text-prompt templates at both the global CLS token and local pixel-wise levels. Our approach could be used as plug-and-play for any segmentation network, does not require additional training data or labels, and remains effective even with a single test sample. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive OVSS TTA benchmark suite, which integrates a rigorous evaluation protocol, seven segmentation datasets, and 15 common corruptions, with a total of 82 distinct test scenarios, establishing a standardized and comprehensive testbed for future TTA research in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our experiments on this suite demonstrate that our segmentation-tailored method consistently delivers significant gains over direct adoption of TTA classification baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Motivated by this, and further inspired by psychological theories suggesting that humans process scenes in an object-based fashion, we propose an object-centric encoder that performs semantic segmentation and visual representation generation in a coupled manner, unlike other works, which treat these as separate processes. To achieve this, we leverage the Slot Attention mechanism and use the SOLV model, pretrained in large out-of-domain datasets, to bootstrap fine-tuning on human action video data. Through simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that visual representations can enhance reinforcement and imitation learning training, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated approach for semantic segmentation and encoding. Furthermore, we show that exploiting models pretrained on out-of-domain datasets can benefit this process, and that fine-tuning on datasets depicting human actions -- although still out-of-domain -- , can significantly improve performance due to close alignment with robotic tasks. These findings show the capability to reduce reliance on annotated or robot-specific action datasets and the potential to build on existing visual encoders to accelerate training and improve generalizability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated through non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make the voxel representation aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Rather than focusing on improving feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a risk-aware approach that harnesses semantic segmentation to continuously evaluate potential hazards in the drone's field of view. By using a specialized deep neural network to assign pixel-level risk values and applying an algorithm based on risk maps, our method adaptively identifies a stable Safe Landing Zone (SLZ) despite moving critical obstacles such as vehicles, people, etc., and other visual challenges like shifting illumination. A control system then guides the UAV toward this low-risk region, employing altitude-dependent safety thresholds and temporal landing point stabilization to ensure robust descent trajectories. Experimental validation in diverse urban environments demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving over 90% landing success rates in very challenging real scenarios, showing significant improvements in various risk metrics. Our findings suggest that risk-oriented vision methods can effectively help reduce the risk of accidents in emergency landing situations, particularly in complex, unstructured, urban scenarios, densely populated with moving risky obstacles, while potentiating the true capabilities of UAVs in complex urban operations.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces a fully automated framework that innovatively integrates remote sensing data, semantic segmentation, polygon-vector refinement, tilt-azimuth estimation, and module layout inference to produce a richly attributed GIS dataset of distributed PV. Applied to Eindhoven (the Netherlands), the method achieves a correlation ($R^2$) of 0.92 with Distribution System Operator (DSO) records, while capacity estimates for 73$\%$ of neighborhoods demonstrate agreement within a $\pm$25$\%$ margin of recorded data. Additionally, by accurately capturing actual system configuration parameters (e.g., tilt, azimuth, module layout) and seamlessly linking them to advanced performance models, the method yields more reliable PV energy generation forecasts within the distribution networks. Centering our experiments toward a high PV-penetration community, configuration-aware simulations help to reduce Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of energy generation modeling by up to 160$\%$ compared to the conventional assumption-based approaches. Furthermore, owing to its modular design and reliance on readily available geospatial resources, the workflow can be extended across diverse regions, offering a scalable solution for robust urban solar integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to Solar Energy for peer review. 42 pages, 15 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Pseudo Labels Generation Using SAM and CLIP for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19846v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis and autonomous driving and has a problem with the high cost of annotating the labels required in training. To address this problem, semantic segmentation methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets: PASCAL and MS COCO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[The Missing Point in Vision Transformers for Universal Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19795v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4 mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

| **[ADD-SLAM: Adaptive Dynamic Dense SLAM with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19420v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods have demonstrated exceptional localization precision and remarkable dense mapping performance. However, dynamic objects introduce critical challenges by disrupting scene consistency, leading to tracking drift and mapping artifacts. Existing methods that employ semantic segmentation or object detection for dynamic identification and filtering typically rely on predefined categorical priors, while discarding dynamic scene information crucial for robotic applications such as dynamic obstacle avoidance and environmental interaction. To overcome these challenges, we propose ADD-SLAM: an Adaptive Dynamic Dense SLAM framework based on Gaussian splitting. We design an adaptive dynamic identification mechanism grounded in scene consistency analysis, comparing geometric and textural discrepancies between real-time observations and historical maps. Ours requires no predefined semantic category priors and adaptively discovers scene dynamics. Precise dynamic object recognition effectively mitigates interference from moving targets during localization. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic-static separation mapping strategy that constructs a temporal Gaussian model to achieve online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate our method's flexible and accurate dynamic segmentation capabilities, along with state-of-the-art performance in both localization and mapping.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Joint Learning Framework with Feature Reconstruction and Prediction for Incomplete Satellite Image Time Series in Agricultural Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19159v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is crucial for agricultural semantic segmentation. However, Cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS, disrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, leading to degraded performance of models trained on complete SITS. Existing methods typically address this by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or using data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may introduce noise and redundancy, while the data-augmented model can only handle limited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint learning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address incomplete SITS more effectively. During training, we simulate data-missing scenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth labels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task constrains the model from selectively reconstructing critical features from masked inputs that align with the teacher's temporal feature representations. It reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation. By integrating reconstructed features into the prediction task, the model avoids learning shortcuts and maintains its ability to handle varied missing patterns and complete SITS. Experiments on SITS from Hunan Province, Western France, and Catalonia show that our method improves mean F1-scores by 6.93% in cropland extraction and 7.09% in crop classification over baselines. It also generalizes well across satellite sensors, including Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope, under varying temporal missing rates and model backbones.</p></details> |  | None |

Manual delineation is extremely labour-intensive, requiring substantial expert time. Fully-supervised machine learning models aim to automate such localisation tasks, but require a large number of costly and often subjective 3D voxel-level labels for training. The high-variance and subjectivity in such labels impacts model generalisability, even when large datasets are available. Histopathology labels may offer more objective labels but the infeasibility of acquiring pixel-level annotations to develop tumour localisation methods based on histology remains challenging in-vivo. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SPARS (Self-Play Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Segmentation), which utilises an object presence classifier, trained on a small number of image-level binary cancer presence labels, to localise cancerous regions on CT scans. Such binary labels of patient-level cancer presence can be sourced more feasibly from biopsies and histopathology reports, enabling a more objective cancer localisation on medical images. Evaluating with real patient data, we observed that SPARS yielded a mean dice score of $77.3 \pm 9.4$, which outperformed other weakly-supervised methods by large margins. This performance was comparable with recent fully-supervised methods that require voxel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate the potential of using SPARS to reduce the need for extensive human-annotated labels to detect cancer in real-world healthcare settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LLM-Guided Taxonomy and Hierarchical Uncertainty for 3D Point CLoud Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18924v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel active learning framework for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation that, for the first time, integrates large language models (LLMs) to construct hierarchical label structures and guide uncertainty-based sample selection. Unlike prior methods that treat labels as flat and independent, our approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse, label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to 4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%), substantially outperforming existing baselines. Our results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs as knowledge priors in 3D vision and establish hierarchical uncertainty modeling as a powerful paradigm for efficient point cloud annotation.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances primarily focus on pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, and co-training strategies. However, existing methods struggle to balance global semantic representation with fine-grained local feature extraction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel tri-branch semi-supervised segmentation framework incorporating a dual-teacher strategy, named IGL-DT. Our approach employs SwinUnet for high-level semantic guidance through Global Context Learning and ResUnet for detailed feature refinement via Local Regional Learning. Additionally, a Discrepancy Learning mechanism mitigates over-reliance on a single teacher, promoting adaptive feature learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior segmentation performance across various data regimes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[SCHEME: Scalable Channel Mixer for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00412v4)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers have achieved impressive performance in many vision tasks. While the token mixer or attention block has been studied in great detail, much less research has been devoted to the channel mixer or feature mixing block (FFN or MLP), which accounts for a significant portion of the model parameters and computation. In this work, we show that the dense MLP connections can be replaced with a sparse block diagonal MLP structure that supports larger expansion ratios by splitting MLP features into groups. To improve the feature clusters formed by this structure we propose the use of a lightweight, parameter-free, channel covariance attention (CCA) mechanism as a parallel branch during training. This enables gradual feature mixing across channel groups during training whose contribution decays to zero as the training progresses to convergence. As a result, the CCA block can be discarded during inference, enabling enhanced performance at no additional computational cost. The resulting $\textit{Scalable CHannEl MixEr}$ (SCHEME) can be plugged into any ViT architecture to obtain a gamut of models with different trade-offs between complexity and performance by controlling the block diagonal MLP structure. This is shown by the introduction of a new family of SCHEMEformer models. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, with $\textbf{12 different ViT backbones}$, consistently demonstrate substantial accuracy/latency gains (upto $\textbf{1.5\% /20\%})$ over existing designs, especially for lower complexity regimes. The SCHEMEformer family is shown to establish new Pareto frontiers for accuracy vs FLOPS, accuracy vs model size, and accuracy vs throughput, especially for fast transformers of small size.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR) dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates (10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on livestock applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[REN: Fast and Efficient Region Encodings from Patch-Based Image Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18153v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Region Encoder Network (REN), a fast and effective model for generating region-based image representations using point prompts. Recent methods combine class-agnostic segmenters (e.g., SAM) with patch-based image encoders (e.g., DINO) to produce compact and effective region representations, but they suffer from high computational cost due to the segmentation step. REN bypasses this bottleneck using a lightweight module that directly generates region tokens, enabling 60x faster token generation with 35x less memory, while also improving token quality. It uses a few cross-attention blocks that take point prompts as queries and features from a patch-based image encoder as keys and values to produce region tokens that correspond to the prompted objects. We train REN with three popular encoders-DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP-and show that it can be extended to other encoders without dedicated training. We evaluate REN on semantic segmentation and retrieval tasks, where it consistently outperforms the original encoders in both performance and compactness, and matches or exceeds SAM-based region methods while being significantly faster. Notably, REN achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging Ego4D VQ2D benchmark and outperforms proprietary LMMs on Visual Haystacks' single-needle challenge.

Yet, real-world applications in safety-critical domains involve a broader set of semantic tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, which come with a diverse set of dedicated model architectures.

We propose the benchmarking tools SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH, along with the most extensive evaluation to date on the reliability and generalization of semantic segmentation and object detection models. In particular, we benchmark 76 segmentation models across four datasets and 61 object detectors across two datasets, evaluating their performance under diverse adversarial attacks and common corruptions. Our findings reveal systematic weaknesses in state-of-the-art models and uncover key trends based on architecture, backbone, and model capacity. SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH are open-sourced in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/benchmarking_reliability_generalization) along with our complete set of total 6139 evaluations.

| **[Semantic segmentation with reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17905v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, pixel-level labeling is not always available. Sometimes, we need a semantic segmentation network, and even a visual encoder can have a high compatibility, and can be trained using various types of feedback beyond traditional labels, such as feedback that indicates the quality of the parsing results. To tackle this issue, we proposed RSS (Reward in Semantic Segmentation), the first practical application of reward-based reinforcement learning on pure semantic segmentation offered in two granular levels (pixel-level and image-level). RSS incorporates various novel technologies, such as progressive scale rewards (PSR) and pair-wise spatial difference (PSD), to ensure that the reward facilitates the convergence of the semantic segmentation network, especially under image-level rewards. Experiments and visualizations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed RSS can successfully ensure the convergence of the semantic segmentation network on two levels of rewards. Additionally, the RSS, which utilizes an image-level reward, outperforms existing weakly supervised methods that also rely solely on image-level signals during training.</p></details> | Tech report | None |

Satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) enables consistent, global-scale deformation tracking; however, deep learning methods remain largely unexplored in this domain, mainly due to the lack of a curated machine learning dataset. In this work, we build on the existing Hephaestus dataset, and introduce Hephaestus Minicubes, a global collection of 38 spatiotemporal datacubes offering high resolution, multi-source and multi-temporal information, covering 44 of the world's most active volcanoes over a 7-year period. Each spatiotemporal datacube integrates InSAR products, topographic data, as well as atmospheric variables which are known to introduce signal delays that can mimic ground deformation in InSAR imagery. Furthermore, we provide expert annotations detailing the type, intensity and spatial extent of deformation events, along with rich text descriptions of the observed scenes. Finally, we present a comprehensive benchmark, demonstrating Hephaestus Minicubes' ability to support volcanic unrest monitoring as a multi-modal, multi-temporal classification and semantic segmentation task, establishing strong baselines with state-of-the-art architectures. This work aims to advance machine learning research in volcanic monitoring, contributing to the growing integration of data-driven methods within Earth science applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DiverseNet: Decision Diversified Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation Networks for Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13716v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to help reduce the cost of the manual labelling process by leveraging a substantial pool of unlabelled data alongside a limited set of labelled data during the training phase. Since pixel-level manual labelling in large-scale remote sensing imagery is expensive and time-consuming, semi-supervised learning has become a widely used solution to deal with this. However, the majority of existing SSL frameworks, especially various teacher-student frameworks, are too bulky to run efficiently on a GPU with limited memory. There is still a lack of lightweight SSL frameworks and efficient perturbation methods to promote the diversity of training samples and enhance the precision of pseudo labels during training. In order to fill this gap, we proposed a simple, lightweight, and efficient SSL architecture named \textit{DiverseHead}, which promotes the utilisation of multiple decision heads instead of multiple whole networks. Another limitation of most existing SSL frameworks is the insufficient diversity of pseudo labels, as they rely on the same network architecture and fail to explore different structures for generating pseudo labels. To solve this issue, we propose \textit{DiverseModel} to explore and analyse different networks in parallel for SSL to increase the diversity of pseudo labels. The two proposed methods, namely \textit{DiverseHead} and \textit{DiverseModel}, both achieve competitive semantic segmentation performance in four widely used remote sensing imagery datasets compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. Meanwhile, the proposed lightweight DiverseHead architecture can be easily applied to various state-of-the-art SSL methods while further improving their performance.

While CNNs excel at capturing local features, they struggle with long-range dependencies, whereas Transformers can model global context but often neglect local details and are computationally expensive.We propose a novel approach, Region-Aware Proxy Network (RAPNet), which consists of two components: Contextual Region Attention (CRA) and Global Class Refinement (GCR). Unlike traditional methods that rely on grid-based layouts, RAPNet operates at the region level for more flexible segmentation. The CRA module uses a Transformer to capture region-level contextual dependencies, generating a Semantic Region Mask (SRM). The GCR module learns a global class attention map to refine multi-class information, combining the SRM and attention map for accurate segmentation.Experiments on three public datasets show that RAPNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior multi-class segmentation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC 2024): Poster Volume I.

| **[Deep mineralogical segmentation of thin section images based on QEMSCAN maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17008v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting the mineralogical aspects of rock thin sections is an important task for oil and gas reservoirs evaluation. However, human analysis tend to be subjective and laborious. Technologies like QEMSCAN(R) are designed to automate the mineralogical mapping process, but also suffer from limitations like high monetary costs and time-consuming analysis. This work proposes a Convolutional Neural Network model for automatic mineralogical segmentation of thin section images of carbonate rocks. The model is able to mimic the QEMSCAN mapping itself in a low-cost, generalized and efficient manner. For this, the U-Net semantic segmentation architecture is trained on plane and cross polarized thin section images using the corresponding QEMSCAN maps as target, which is an approach not widely explored. The model was instructed to differentiate occurrences of Calcite, Dolomite, Mg-Clay Minerals, Quartz, Pores and the remaining mineral phases as an unique class named "Others", while it was validated on rock facies both seen and unseen during training, in order to address its generalization capability. Since the images and maps are provided in different resolutions, image registration was applied to align then spatially. The study reveals that the quality of the segmentation is very much dependent on these resolution differences and on the variety of learnable rock textures. However, it shows promising results, especially with regard to the proper delineation of minerals boundaries on solid textures and precise estimation of the minerals distributions, describing a nearly linear relationship between expected and predicted distributions, with coefficient of determination (R^2) superior to 0.97 for seen facies and 0.88 for unseen.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OpenSeg-R: Improving Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16974v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability.

However, these models are predominantly trained on large-scale semantic segmentation datasets, which introduce a bias toward object shape rather than texture cues in the image. This limitation is critical in domains such as medical imaging, material classification, and remote sensing, where texture changes define object boundaries. In this study, we investigate SAM's bias toward semantics over textures and introduce a new texture-aware foundation model, TextureSAM, which performs superior segmentation in texture-dominant scenarios. To achieve this, we employ a novel fine-tuning approach that incorporates texture augmentation techniques, incrementally modifying training images to emphasize texture features. By leveraging a novel texture-alternation of the ADE20K dataset, we guide TextureSAM to prioritize texture-defined regions, thereby mitigating the inherent shape bias present in the original SAM model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that TextureSAM significantly outperforms SAM-2 on both natural (+0.2 mIoU) and synthetic (+0.18 mIoU) texture-based segmentation datasets. The code and texture-augmented dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Style Transfer with Diffusion Models for Synthetic-to-Real Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16360v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence, unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems for challenging real-world applications.

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the right-skewed asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix; v2: slight improvement in presentation.

| **[VP Lab: a PEFT-Enabled Visual Prompting Laboratory for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15592v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pretrained vision backbones have transformed computer vision by providing powerful feature extractors that enable various downstream tasks, including training-free approaches like visual prompting for semantic segmentation. Despite their success in generic scenarios, these models often fall short when applied to specialized technical domains where the visual features differ significantly from their training distribution. To bridge this gap, we introduce VP Lab, a comprehensive iterative framework that enhances visual prompting for robust segmentation model development. At the core of VP Lab lies E-PEFT, a novel ensemble of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques specifically designed to adapt our visual prompting pipeline to specific domains in a manner that is both parameter- and data-efficient. Our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for the Segment Anything Model (SAM), but also facilitates an interactive, near-real-time loop, allowing users to observe progressively improving results as they experiment within the framework. By integrating E-PEFT with visual prompting, we demonstrate a remarkable 50\% increase in semantic segmentation mIoU performance across various technical datasets using only 5 validated images, establishing a new paradigm for fast, efficient, and interactive model deployment in new, challenging domains. This work comes in the form of a demonstration.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches have addressed class emergence, they often overlook class imbalance, resulting in suboptimal performance -- particularly on rare categories. To tackle this challenge, we propose CLIMB-3D, a unified framework for \textbf{CL}ass-incremental \textbf{Imb}alance-aware \textbf{3D}IS. Building upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust performance under constrained memory conditions. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen prior model. Despite its promise, PLG tends to bias towards frequent classes. Therefore, we propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme, that estimates object frequencies from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias -- without requiring access to past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, and additionally on semantic segmentation on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by up to 16.76\% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30\% mIoU for semantic segmentation, demonstrating strong generalization across both frequent and rare classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D) |

We propose a novel multi-view projection framework that excels in both domain generalization (DG) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our approach first aligns Lidar scans into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to create a large-scale synthetic 2D dataset (PC2D). We then use it to train a 2D segmentation model in-domain. During inference, the model processes hundreds of views per scene; the resulting logits are back-projected to 3D with an occlusion-aware voting scheme to generate final point-wise labels. Our framework is modular and enables extensive exploration of key design parameters, such as view generation optimization (VGO), visualization modality optimization (MODO), and 2D model choice. We evaluate on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets under both the DG and UDA settings. We achieve state-of-the-art results in UDA and close to state-of-the-art in DG, with particularly large gains on large, static classes.

To address this, integrating additional thermal radiation data with RGB images demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness. However, how to effectively reconcile the modality discrepancies and fuse the RGB and thermal features remains a well-known challenge. In this work, we address this challenge from a novel spectral perspective. We observe that the multi-modal features can be categorized into two spectral components: low-frequency features that provide broad scene context, including color variations and smooth areas, and high-frequency features that capture modality-specific details such as edges and textures. Inspired by this, we propose the Spectral-aware Global Fusion Network (SGFNet) to effectively enhance and fuse the multi-modal features by explicitly modeling the interactions between the high-frequency, modality-specific features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the MFNet and PST900 datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  | None |

Among them, Copy-Paste is a simple yet effective method and gain great attention recently. However, existing Copy-Paste often overlook contextual relevance between source and target images, resulting in inconsistencies in generated outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a context-aware approach that integrates Bidirectional Latent Information Propagation (BLIP) for content extraction from source images. By matching extracted content information with category information, our method ensures cohesive integration of target objects using Segment Anything Model (SAM) and You Only Look Once (YOLO). This approach eliminates the need for manual annotation, offering an automated and user-friendly solution. Experimental evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing data diversity and generating high-quality pseudo-images across various computer vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Semantic segmentation (SS) of RSIs enables the fine-grained interpretation of surface features, making it a critical task in remote sensing analysis. With the increasing diversity and volume of RSIs collected by sensors on various platforms, traditional processing methods struggle to maintain efficiency and accuracy. In response, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling substantial advances in remote sensing image semantic segmentation (RSISS) by automating feature extraction and improving segmentation accuracy across diverse modalities. This paper revisits the evolution of DL-based RSISS by categorizing existing approaches into four stages: the early pixel-based methods, the prevailing patch-based and tile-based techniques, and the emerging image-based strategies enabled by foundation models. We analyze these developments from the perspective of feature extraction and learning strategies, revealing the field's progression from pixel-level to tile-level and from unimodal to multimodal segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nearly 40 advanced techniques on a unified dataset to quantitatively characterize their performance and applicability. This review offers a holistic view of DL-based SS for RS, highlighting key advancements, comparative insights, and open challenges to guide future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables</p></details> | None |

The calibration in fusion between sensors such as LiDAR and camera is always supposed to be precise in previous work. However, in reality, calibration matrices are fixed when the vehicles leave the factory, but vibration, bumps, and data lags may cause calibration bias. As the research on the calibration influence on fusion detection performance is relatively few, flexible calibration dependency multi-sensor detection method has always been attractive. In this paper, we conducted experiments on SOTA detection method EPNet++ and proved slight bias on calibration can reduce the performance seriously. We also proposed a re-calibration model based on semantic segmentation which can be combined with a detection algorithm to improve the performance and robustness of multi-modal calibration bias.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |

By integrating these components, SMS enables generalizable physical reasoning and object-centric planning without the need to re-learn foundational physical dynamics. We empirically validate SMS in a billiards-inspired manipulation task and a challenging quadrotor landing scenario, demonstrating robust performance on both simulated domain transfer and real-world experiments.

This study focuses on assessing the potential of LiDAR data for accurate 3D building reconstruction at LOD1 and extracting morphological features from these models. Four deep semantic segmentation models, U-Net, Attention U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepLabV3+, were used, applying transfer learning to extract building footprints from LiDAR data. The results showed that U-Net3+ and Attention U-Net outperformed the others, achieving IoU scores of 0.833 and 0.814, respectively. Various statistical measures, including maximum, range, mode, median, and the 90th percentile, were used to estimate building heights, resulting in the generation of 3D models at LOD1. As the main contribution of the research, the impact of segmentation accuracy on the quality of 3D building modeling and the accuracy of morphological features like building area and external wall surface area was investigated. The results showed that the accuracy of building identification (segmentation performance) significantly affects the 3D model quality and the estimation of morphological features, depending on the height calculation method. Overall, the UNet3+ method, utilizing the 90th percentile and median measures, leads to accurate height estimation of buildings and the extraction of morphological features.</p></details> |  | None |

One area of improvement which has been highlighted by SGPN's authors, pertains to use of memory intensive similarity matrices which occupy memory quadratic in the number of points. In this report, we attempt to tackle this issue through use of two sampling based methods, which compute Instance Segmentation on a sub-sampled Point Set, and then extrapolate labels to the complete set using the nearest neigbhour approach. While both approaches perform equally well on large sub-samples, the random-based strategy gives the most improvements in terms of speed and memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 11 figures, paper dated 2019</p></details> | None |

At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting, inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on the classification corruption benchmarks, including ImageNet-C and CIFAR-10/100-C, as well as the Cityscapes$\rightarrow$ACDC semantic segmentation task, covering recurring and continuously evolving domain shifts, demonstrate that ReservoirTTA significantly improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, conventional KD frameworks rely on pre-trained high-capacity teacher networks, which introduce significant challenges such as increased memory/storage requirements, additional training costs, and ambiguity in selecting an appropriate teacher for a given student model. Although a teacher-free distillation (self-distillation) has emerged as a promising alternative, many existing approaches still rely on architectural modifications or complex training procedures, which limit their generality and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on teacher-free distillation that operates using a single student network without any auxiliary components, architectural modifications, or additional learnable parameters. Our approach is built on a simple yet highly effective augmentation, called intra-class patch swap augmentation. This augmentation simulates a teacher-student dynamic within a single model by generating pairs of intra-class samples with varying confidence levels, and then applying instance-to-instance distillation to align their predictive distributions. Our method is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement, requiring only a single augmentation function. Extensive experiments across image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection show that our method consistently outperforms both existing self-distillation baselines and conventional teacher-based KD approaches. These results suggest that the success of self-distillation could hinge on the design of the augmentation itself.

Spectral shift, which emerges from disparities in sensors and geospatial conditions, poses a significant challenge in this domain. Existing methods predominantly rely on domain adaptation and generalization strategies, often utilizing small-scale models that exhibit limited performance. In contrast, Land-MoE addresses these issues by hierarchically inserting a Frequency-aware Mixture of Low-rank Token Experts, to fine-tune Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, Land-MoE comprises two key modules: the mixture of low-rank token experts (MoLTE) and frequency-aware filters (FAF). MoLTE leverages rank-differentiated tokens to generate diverse feature adjustments for individual instances within multispectral images. By dynamically combining learnable low-rank token experts of varying ranks, it enhances the robustness against spectral shifts. Meanwhile, FAF conducts frequency-domain modulation on the refined features. This process enables the model to effectively capture frequency band information that is strongly correlated with semantic essence, while simultaneously suppressing frequency noise irrelevant to the task. Comprehensive experiments on MLCC tasks involving cross-sensor and cross-geospatial setups demonstrate that Land-MoE outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Additionally, the proposed approach has also achieved state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization semantic segmentation tasks of RGB remote sensing images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its adaptation to visual inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse. Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments on image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change detection demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous Mamba-based backbones, particularly under high-resolution settings.</p></details> | Work in progressing | None |

However, while most methods aim to improve accuracy, their computational efficiency remains underexplored. To address this, we propose EGFormer, an efficient multimodal semantic segmentation framework that flexibly integrates an arbitrary number of modalities while significantly reducing model parameters and inference time without sacrificing performance. Our framework introduces two novel modules. First, the Any-modal Scoring Module (ASM) assigns importance scores to each modality independently, enabling dynamic ranking based on their feature maps. Second, the Modal Dropping Module (MDM) filters out less informative modalities at each stage, selectively preserving and aggregating only the most valuable features. This design allows the model to leverage useful information from all available modalities while discarding redundancy, thus ensuring high segmentation quality. In addition to efficiency, we evaluate EGFormer on a synthetic-to-real transfer task to demonstrate its generalizability. Extensive experiments show that EGFormer achieves competitive performance with up to 88 percent reduction in parameters and 50 percent fewer GFLOPs. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, it further achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In the context of industrial image inspection, conventional semantic segmentation models fail to maintain the segmentation consistency of fixed components across varying contextual environments due to a lack of perception of object contours. Given the real-time constraints and limited computing capability of industrial image detection machines, it is also necessary to create efficient models to reduce computational complexity. In this work, a Shape-Aware Efficient Network (SPENet) is proposed, which focuses on the shapes of objects to achieve excellent segmentation consistency by separately supervising the extraction of boundary and body information from images. In SPENet, a novel method is introduced for describing fuzzy boundaries to better adapt to real-world scenarios named Variable Boundary Domain (VBD). Additionally, a new metric, Consistency Mean Square Error(CMSE), is proposed to measure segmentation consistency for fixed components. Our approach attains the best segmentation accuracy and competitive speed on our dataset, showcasing significant advantages in CMSE among numerous state-of-the-art real-time segmentation networks, achieving a reduction of over 50% compared to the previously top-performing models.</p></details> |  | None |

Such data curation is labor-intensive and imposes significant overhead regarding time and costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL) partially overcomes these limitations by exploiting vast amounts of unlabeled data and creating surrogate (pretext or proxy) tasks to learn useful representations without manual labeling. As a result, SSL has become a powerful machine learning (ML) paradigm for solving several practical downstream computer vision problems, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. Image segmentation is the cornerstone of many high-level visual perception applications, including medical imaging, intelligent transportation, agriculture, and surveillance. Although there is substantial research potential for developing advanced algorithms for SSL-based semantic segmentation, a comprehensive study of existing methodologies is essential to trace advances and guide emerging researchers. This survey thoroughly investigates over 150 recent image segmentation articles, particularly focusing on SSL. It provides a practical categorization of pretext tasks, downstream tasks, and commonly used benchmark datasets for image segmentation research.

To address this, we propose a two-stage framework called RobustSeg, which enhances multi-modal robustness through two key components: the Hybrid Prototype Distillation Module (HPDM) and the Representation Regularization Module (RRM). In the first stage, RobustSeg pre-trains a multi-modal teacher model using complete modalities. In the second stage, a student model is trained with random modality dropout while learning from the teacher via HPDM and RRM. HPDM transforms features into compact prototypes, enabling cross-modal hybrid knowledge distillation and mitigating bias from missing modalities. RRM reduces representation discrepancies between the teacher and student by optimizing functional entropy through the log-Sobolev inequality. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that RobustSeg outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of +2.76%, +4.56%, and +0.98%, respectively.

To tackle the problem of the neglect of inter-feature relationships, high-frequency information loss, and the limited attention to downstream tasks, this paper focuses on how to model correlation-driven decomposing features and reason high-level graph representation by efficiently extracting complementary information and aggregating multi-guided features. We propose a three-branch encoder-decoder architecture along with corresponding fusion layers as the fusion strategy. Firstly, shallow features from individual modalities are extracted by a depthwise convolution layer combined with the transformer block. In the three parallel branches of the encoder, Cross Attention and Invertible Block (CAI) extracts local features and preserves high-frequency texture details. Base Feature Extraction Module (BFE) captures long-range dependencies and enhances modality-shared information. Graph Reasoning Module (GR) is introduced to reason high-level cross-modality relations and simultaneously extract low-level detail features as CAI's modality-specific complementary information. Experiments demonstrate the competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods in visible/infrared image fusion and medical image fusion tasks. Moreover, the proposed algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of subsequent tasks, averagely scoring 8.27% mAP@0.5 higher in object detection and 5.85% mIoU higher in semantic segmentation.

While current approaches typically distill 3D semantic features from 2D foundational models (e.g., CLIP and SAM) to facilitate novel view segmentation and semantic understanding, their heavy reliance on 2D supervision can undermine cross-view semantic consistency and necessitate complex data preparation processes, therefore hindering view-consistent scene understanding. In this work, we present FreeGS, an unsupervised semantic-embedded 3DGS framework that achieves view-consistent 3D scene understanding without the need for 2D labels. Instead of directly learning semantic features, we introduce the IDentity-coupled Semantic Field (IDSF) into 3DGS, which captures both semantic representations and view-consistent instance indices for each Gaussian. We optimize IDSF with a two-step alternating strategy: semantics help to extract coherent instances in 3D space, while the resulting instances regularize the injection of stable semantics from 2D space. Additionally, we adopt a 2D-3D joint contrastive loss to enhance the complementarity between view-consistent 3D geometry and rich semantics during the bootstrapping process, enabling FreeGS to uniformly perform tasks such as novel-view semantic segmentation, object selection, and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on LERF-Mask, 3D-OVS, and ScanNet datasets demonstrate that FreeGS performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods while avoiding the complex data preprocessing workload.

Remote sensing imagery exhibits substantial variability across temporal, spectral, and spatial (TSS) dimensions, complicating unified data processing. Current deep learning models for dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and change detection, are typically tailored to specific input-output configurations. Consequently, variations in data dimensionality or task requirements often lead to significant performance degradation or model incompatibility, necessitating costly retraining or fine-tuning efforts for different application scenarios. This paper introduces the Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Network (TSSUN), a novel architecture designed for unified representation and modeling of remote sensing data across diverse TSS characteristics and task types. TSSUN employs a Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Strategy that leverages meta-information to decouple and standardize input representations from varied temporal, spectral, and spatial configurations, and similarly unifies output structures for different dense prediction tasks and class numbers. Furthermore, a Local-Global Window Attention mechanism is proposed to efficiently capture both local contextual details and global dependencies, enhancing the model's adaptability and feature extraction capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that a single TSSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and unifies various dense prediction tasks. The proposed approach consistently achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications without requiring task-specific modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, Code link:https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN) |

To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to explore multi-task generation for remote sensing. EarthSynth, trained on the EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training strategy to improve training data diversity and enhance category control. Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world scenarios, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.</p></details> | 23 pages | None |

Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text embeddings, even after extensive alignment during training. Additionally, relying solely on deep text-aligned features limits shallow-level feature guidance, which is crucial for detecting small objects and fine details, ultimately reducing segmentation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a dual prompting framework, DPSeg, for this task. Our approach combines dual-prompt cost volume generation, a cost volume-guided decoder, and a semantic-guided prompt refinement strategy that leverages our dual prompting scheme to mitigate alignment issues in visual prompt generation. By incorporating visual embeddings from a visual prompt encoder, our approach reduces the domain gap between text and image embeddings while providing multi-level guidance through shallow features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | None |
| **[Disentangling CLIP for Multi-Object Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02977v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models like CLIP excel at recognizing the single, prominent object in a scene. However, they struggle in complex scenes containing multiple objects. We identify a fundamental reason behind this limitation: VLMs features space exhibits significant semantic entanglement, where features of one class contain substantial information about other unrelated classes, a phenomenon we term mutual feature information (MFI). This entanglement becomes evident during class-specific queries, as unrelated objects are activated alongside the queried class. To address this limitation, we propose DCLIP, a framework that disentangles CLIP features using two complementary objectives: a novel MFI Loss that orthogonalizes the text (class) features to reduce inter-class similarity, and the Asymmetric Loss (ASL) that aligns image features with the disentangled text features. Our experiment demonstrates that DCLIP reduces inter-class feature similarity by 30\% compared to CLIP, leading to significant performance gains on multi-label recognition (MLR) and zero-shot semantic segmentation (ZS3). In MLR, DCLIP outperforms SOTA approaches on VOC2007 and COCO-14 while using 75\% fewer parameters, and surpasses SOTA ZS3 methods by 3.4 mIoU on VOC2012 and 2.8 mIoU on COCO-17. These results establish feature disentanglement as a critical factor for effective multi-object perception in vision-language models.</p></details> |  | None |

While class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is crucial for handling diverse and newly emerging objects in the real world, traditional CISS methods require expensive pixel-level annotations for training. To overcome this limitation, partially weakly-supervised approaches have recently been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a completely weakly-supervised method for CISS. To achieve this, we propose to generate robust pseudo-labels by combining pseudo-labels from a localizer and a sequence of foundation models based on their uncertainty. Moreover, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce an exemplar-guided data augmentation method that generates diverse images containing both previous and novel classes with guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments in three common experimental settings: 15-5 VOC, 10-10 VOC, and COCO-to-VOC, and in two scenarios: disjoint and overlap. The experimental results demonstrate that our completely weakly supervised method outperforms even partially weakly supervised methods in the 15-5 VOC and 10-10 VOC settings while achieving competitive accuracy in the COCO-to-VOC setting.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Moreover, as far as we are aware, there are no public annotated datasets generated through Structure From Motion (SfM) algorithms applied to imagery, which may be due to the lack of SfM algorithms that can map semantic segmentation information into an accurate point cloud, especially in a challenging environment like forests. In this work, we present a novel pipeline for generating semantically segmented point clouds of forest environments. Using a custom-built forest simulator, we generate realistic RGB images of diverse forest scenes along with their corresponding semantic segmentation masks. These labeled images are then processed using modified open-source SfM software capable of preserving semantic information during 3D reconstruction. The resulting point clouds provide both geometric and semantic detail, offering a valuable resource for training and evaluating deep learning models aimed at segmenting real forest point clouds obtained via SfM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress, accepted in Novel Approaches for Precision Agriculture and Forestry with Autonomous Robots, ICRA 2025 Workshop - May 23, 2025 - Atlanta, GA</p></details> | None |

However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer, featuring linear temporal complexity $\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention. Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking, and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with over 15\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency gains, achieving $\times 16$, $\times 10$ and $\times 5$ improvements on the three tasks. https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer) |

In real-world applications, models are typically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the environment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in model performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by adapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains. Despite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing challenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To tackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for ALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer selection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select low-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we propose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on entropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing model stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation mechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers with those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation and source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we construct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA benchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU improvements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference. The new benchmarks and code are available at https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA.</p></details> | 18 pages,12 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA) |

However, existing research commonly overlooks the fine-grained class relationships within the semantic space when addressing heterogeneous problems, particularly domain shift. This oversight results in ambiguities between class representation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel federated segmentation framework that strikes class consistency, termed FedSaaS. Specifically, we introduce class exemplars as a criterion for both local- and global-level class representations. On the server side, the uploaded class exemplars are leveraged to model class prototypes, which supervise global branch of clients, ensuring alignment with global-level representation. On the client side, we incorporate an adversarial mechanism to harmonize contributions of global and local branches, leading to consistent output. Moreover, multilevel contrastive losses are employed on both sides to enforce consistency between two-level representations in the same semantic space. Extensive experiments on several driving scene segmentation datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving average segmentation accuracy and effectively addressing the class-consistency representation problem.</p></details> |  | None |

However, visual representations are inherently independent of language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal visual anomaly segmentation. We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images, we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot, and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods.

Inadequate illumination can lead to significant information loss and poor image quality, impacting various applications such as surveillance. photography, or even autonomous driving. In this regard, automated methods have been developed to automatically adjust illumination in the image for a better visual perception. Current enhancement techniques often use specific datasets to enhance low-light images, but still present challenges when adapting to diverse real-world conditions, where illumination degradation may be localized to specific regions. To address this challenge, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, whose main approach is the use of a classification mechanism to determine whether local or global illumination enhancement is required. Subsequently, estimator networks adjust illumination based on this classification and simultaneously enhance color fidelity. ALEN integrates the Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization, complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet), and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise estimation of illumination and color, respectively. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for low-light conditions were carried out to underscore ALEN's robust generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The ALEN not only enhances image quality in terms of visual perception but also represents an advancement in high-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, as presented in this work.

MESSI is unique in two main features. First, it contains images from various altitudes, allowing us to investigate the effect of depth on semantic segmentation. Second, it includes images taken from several different urban regions (at different altitudes). This is important since the variety covers the visual richness captured by a drone's 3D flight, performing horizontal and vertical maneuvers. MESSI contains images annotated with location, orientation, and the camera's intrinsic parameters and can be used to train a deep neural network for semantic segmentation or other applications of interest (e.g., localization, navigation, and tracking). This paper describes the dataset and provides annotation details. It also explains how semantic segmentation was performed using several neural network models and shows several relevant statistics. MESSI will be published in the public domain to serve as an evaluation benchmark for semantic segmentation using images captured by a drone or similar vehicle flying over a dense urban environment.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and super-resolution, conventional upsampling operators cannot accommodate the slenderness of tubular structures and the curvature of morphology. This paper introduces a dynamic snake upsampling operators and a boundary-skeleton weighted loss tailored for topological tubular structures. Specifically, we design a snake upsampling operators based on an adaptive sampling domain, which dynamically adjusts the sampling stride according to the feature map and selects a set of subpixel sampling points along the serpentine path, enabling more accurate subpixel-level feature recovery for tubular structures. Meanwhile, we propose a skeleton-to-boundary increasing weighted loss that trades off main body and boundary weight allocation based on mask class ratio and distance field, preserving main body overlap while enhancing focus on target topological continuity and boundary alignment precision. Experiments across various domain datasets and backbone networks show that this plug-and-play dynamic snake upsampling operator and boundary-skeleton weighted loss boost both pixel-wise segmentation accuracy and topological consistency of results.</p></details> |  | None |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these gaps by coupling generation with external search. We analyse how hyperparameters influence speed and quality in RAG systems, covering Chroma and Faiss vector stores, chunking policies, cross-encoder re-ranking, and temperature, and we evaluate six metrics: faithfulness, answer correctness, answer relevancy, context precision, context recall, and answer similarity. Chroma processes queries 13% faster, whereas Faiss yields higher retrieval precision, revealing a clear speed-accuracy trade-off. Naive fixed-length chunking with small windows and minimal overlap outperforms semantic segmentation while remaining the quickest option. Re-ranking provides modest gains in retrieval quality yet increases runtime by roughly a factor of 5, so its usefulness depends on latency constraints. These results help practitioners balance computational cost and accuracy when tuning RAG systems for transparent, up-to-date responses. Finally, we re-evaluate the top configurations with a corrective RAG workflow and show that their advantages persist when the model can iteratively request additional evidence. We obtain a near-perfect context precision (99%), which demonstrates that RAG systems can achieve extremely high retrieval accuracy with the right combination of hyperparameters, with significant implications for applications where retrieval quality directly impacts downstream task performance, such as clinical decision support in healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods for assessing these characteristics typically rely on cell proxy tasks and require additional post-processing steps. In this work, We focus on a novel task-TLS Semantic Segmentation (TLS-SS)-which segments both the regions and maturation stages of TLS in WSI in an end-to-end manner. Due to the extensive scale of WSI and patch-based segmentation strategies, TLS-SS necessitates integrating from neighboring patches to guide target patch (target) segmentation. Previous techniques often employ on multi-resolution approaches, constraining the capacity to leverage the broader neighboring context while tend to preserve coarse-grained information. To address this, we propose a GNN-based Neighboring Context Aggregation Framework (GNCAF), which progressively aggregates multi-hop neighboring context from the target and employs a self-attention mechanism to guide the segmentation of the target. GNCAF can be integrated with various segmentation models to enhance their ability to perceive contextual information outside of the patch. We build two TLS-SS datasets, called TCGA-COAD and INHOUSE-PAAD, and make the former (comprising 225 WSIs and 5041 TLSs) publicly available. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNCAF, achieving a maximum of 22.08% and 26.57% improvement in mF1 and mIoU, respectively. Additionally, we also validate the task scalability of GNCAF on segmentation of lymph node metastases.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we introduce a sampling-free approach for estimating well-calibrated confidence values for classification tasks, achieving alignment with true classification accuracy and significantly reducing inference time compared to sampling-based methods. Our evaluation using the Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) metric for LiDAR semantic segmentation shows that our approach maintains well-calibrated confidence values while achieving increased processing speed compared to a sampling baseline. Additionally, reliability diagrams reveal that our method produces underconfidence rather than overconfident predictions, an advantage for safety-critical applications.

In this work, we propose a complementary boundary and context distillation (BCD) method within the KD framework for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted knowledge transfer from large accurate teacher models to compact efficient student models. Specifically, the boundary distillation component focuses on extracting explicit object-level semantic boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps of the backbone network to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Concurrently, the context distillation component leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions. Our proposed BCD method is specifically designed for EDIP tasks and is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Extensive experimental results across semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on various representative datasets demonstrate that our method can outperform existing methods without requiring extra supervisions or incurring increased inference costs, resulting in well-defined object boundaries and smooth connecting regions.</p></details> | under submission | None |

The results show that depth images are broadly viewed as privacy-safe, and a similarly high proportion of respondents feel the same about semantic segmentation images. Additionally, the majority of participants consider 32*32 resolution RGB images to be almost sufficiently privacy-preserving, while most believe that 16*16 resolution can fully guarantee privacy protection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feedback-Driven Pseudo-Label Reliability Assessment: Redefining Thresholding for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07691v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled data to enhance model performance, addressing the limitations of fully supervised approaches. Among its strategies, pseudo-supervision has proven highly effective, typically relying on one or multiple teacher networks to refine pseudo-labels before training a student network. A common practice in pseudo-supervision is filtering pseudo-labels based on pre-defined confidence thresholds or entropy. However, selecting optimal thresholds requires large labeled datasets, which are often scarce in real-world semi-supervised scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose Ensemble-of-Confidence Reinforcement (ENCORE), a dynamic feedback-driven thresholding strategy for pseudo-label selection. Instead of relying on static confidence thresholds, ENCORE estimates class-wise true-positive confidence within the unlabeled dataset and continuously adjusts thresholds based on the model's response to different levels of pseudo-label filtering. This feedback-driven mechanism ensures the retention of informative pseudo-labels while filtering unreliable ones, enhancing model training without manual threshold tuning. Our method seamlessly integrates into existing pseudo-supervision frameworks and significantly improves segmentation performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating ENCORE with existing pseudo-supervision frameworks enhances performance across multiple datasets and network architectures, validating its effectiveness in semi-supervised learning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 Figures | None |

Recent advancements have introduced deterministic sampling processes that reduce inference from 15 iterative steps to a single step, thereby significantly improving the inference speed of existing diffusion models. However, their efficiency remains limited when handling complex semantic regions due to the single-step inference. To address this limitation, we propose SAMSR, a semantic-guided diffusion framework that incorporates semantic segmentation masks into the sampling process. Specifically, we introduce the SAM-Noise Module, which refines Gaussian noise using segmentation masks to preserve spatial and semantic features. Furthermore, we develop a pixel-wise sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the residual transfer rate and noise strength based on pixel-level semantic weights, prioritizing semantically rich regions during the diffusion process. To enhance model training, we also propose a semantic consistency loss, which aligns pixel-wise semantic weights between predictions and ground truth. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SAMSR significantly improves perceptual quality and detail recovery, particularly in semantically complex images.

Fortunately, Domain Generalization (DG) excels without the need for any target data. Recent works expose that depth maps contribute to improved generalized performance in the UDA tasks, but they ignore the noise and holes in depth maps due to device and environmental factors, failing to sufficiently and effectively learn domain-invariant representation. Although high-sensitivity region suppression has shown promising results in learning domain-invariant features, existing methods cannot be directly applicable to depth maps due to their unique characteristics. Hence, we propose a novel framework, namely Depth-Sensitive Soft Suppression with RGB-D inter-modal stylization flow (DSSS), focusing on learning domain-invariant features from depth maps for the DG semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose the RGB-D inter-modal stylization flow to generate stylized depth maps for sensitivity detection, cleverly utilizing RGB information as the stylization source. Then, a class-wise soft spatial sensitivity suppression is designed to identify and emphasize non-sensitive depth features that contain more domain-invariant information. Furthermore, an RGB-D soft alignment loss is proposed to ensure that the stylized depth maps only align part of the RGB features while still retaining the unique depth information. To our best knowledge, our DSSS framework is the first work to integrate RGB and Depth information in the multi-class DG semantic segmentation task. Extensive experiments over multiple backbone networks show that our framework achieves remarkable performance improvement.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method integrates a Swin Transformer backbone enhanced with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) for improved spatial generalization, alongside a Color Shift Estimation-and-Correction module designed to compensate for illumination inconsistencies in natural environments. To further improve training stability, we adopt a quantile-based denoising strategy that downweights the top 2.5\% of highest-error pixels, treating them as noise and suppressing their influence during optimization. Evaluated on the official GOOSE test set, our approach achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.848, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining color correction, positional encoding, and error-aware denoising in robust semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for thermal image segmentation can be an efficient solution to address the lack of labeled thermal datasets. Nevertheless, since these methods do not effectively utilize the complementary information between RGB and thermal images, they significantly decrease performance during domain adaptation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on cross-spectral UDA for thermal image semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel masked mutual learning strategy that promotes complementary information exchange by selectively transferring results between each spectral model while masking out uncertain regions. Additionally, we introduce a novel prototypical self-supervised loss designed to enhance the performance of the thermal segmentation model in nighttime scenarios. This approach addresses the limitations of RGB pre-trained networks, which cannot effectively transfer knowledge under low illumination due to the inherent constraints of RGB sensors. In experiments, our method achieves higher performance over previous UDA methods and comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Robotics and Automation(ICRA) 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods, involving simple transformations such as rotations and flips, create new images but often lack diversity along key semantic dimensions and fail to alter high-level semantic properties. To address this issue, generative models have emerged as an effective solution for augmenting data by generating synthetic images. Controllable Generative models offer data augmentation methods for semantic segmentation tasks by using prompts and visual references from the original image. However, these models face challenges in generating synthetic images that accurately reflect the content and structure of the original image due to difficulties in creating effective prompts and visual references. In this work, we introduce an effective data augmentation pipeline for semantic segmentation using Controllable Diffusion model. Our proposed method includes efficient prompt generation using \textit{Class-Prompt Appending} and \textit{Visual Prior Blending} to enhance attention to labeled classes in real images, allowing the pipeline to generate a precise number of augmented images while preserving the structure of segmentation-labeled classes. In addition, we implement a \textit{class balancing algorithm} to ensure a balanced training dataset when merging the synthetic and original images. Evaluation on PASCAL VOC datasets, our pipeline demonstrates its effectiveness in generating high-quality synthetic images for semantic segmentation.

| **[Reducing Unimodal Bias in Multi-Modal Semantic Segmentation with Multi-Scale Functional Entropy Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06635v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fusing and balancing multi-modal inputs from novel sensors for dense prediction tasks, particularly semantic segmentation, is critically important yet remains a significant challenge. One major limitation is the tendency of multi-modal frameworks to over-rely on easily learnable modalities, a phenomenon referred to as unimodal dominance or bias. This issue becomes especially problematic in real-world scenarios where the dominant modality may be unavailable, resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we apply a simple but effective plug-and-play regularization term based on functional entropy, which introduces no additional parameters or modules. This term is designed to intuitively balance the contribution of each visual modality to the segmentation results. Specifically, we leverage the log-Sobolev inequality to bound functional entropy using functional-Fisher-information. By maximizing the information contributed by each visual modality, our approach mitigates unimodal dominance and establishes a more balanced and robust segmentation framework. A multi-scale regularization module is proposed to apply our proposed plug-and-play term on high-level features and also segmentation predictions for more balanced multi-modal learning. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance, i.e., +13.94%, +3.25%, and +3.64%, without introducing any additional parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose RESAR-BEV, a progressive refinement framework that advances beyond single-step end-to-end approaches: (1) progressive refinement through residual autoregressive learning that decomposes BEV segmentation into interpretable coarse-to-fine stages via our Drive-Transformer and Modifier-Transformer residual prediction cascaded architecture, (2) robust BEV representation combining ground-proximity voxels with adaptive height offsets and dual-path voxel feature encoding (max+attention pooling) for efficient feature extraction, and (3) decoupled supervision with offline Ground Truth decomposition and online joint optimization to prevent overfitting while ensuring structural coherence. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate RESAR-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance with 54.0% mIoU across 7 essential driving-scene categories while maintaining real-time capability at 14.6 FPS.

| **[Improving Open-Set Semantic Segmentation in 3D Point Clouds by Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization: Preliminary Results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11521v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point-cloud semantic segmentation underpins a wide range of critical applications. Although recent deep architectures and large-scale datasets have driven impressive closed-set performance, these models struggle to recognize or properly segment objects outside their training classes. This gap has sparked interest in Open-Set Semantic Segmentation (O3S), where models must both correctly label known categories and detect novel, unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the segmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel regularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that maximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned on each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages the encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the network's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting unseen objects. We further outline future directions for dynamic open-world adaptation and efficient information-theoretic estimation.</p></details> |  | None |

Similarly, when the test data did not include slices from the same patient (covariate shift setting), the proposed method outperformed in AUC measure.</p></details> | 8 pages,4 figures | None |

For several tasks, quantifying the uncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of the class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated uncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation jointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task uncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ method. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised models, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic USAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k, DAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ alternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines, or balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML'25 | None |
| **[Split Matching for Inductive Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05023v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment categories that are not annotated during training. While fine-tuning vision-language models has achieved promising results, these models often overfit to seen categories due to the lack of supervision for unseen classes. As an alternative to fully supervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS, as it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However, conventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks, needs full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background in the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates). Specifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then conducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity and mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual multi-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial details across resolutions. SM is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Collecting diverse real-world data for testing the robustness of DL models is resource-intensive, making synthetic corruptions an attractive alternative for robustness testing. However, are synthetic corruptions a reliable proxy for real-world corruptions? To answer this, we conduct the largest benchmarking study on semantic segmentation models, comparing performance on real-world corruptions and synthetic corruptions datasets. Our results reveal a strong correlation in mean performance, supporting the use of synthetic corruptions for robustness evaluation. We further analyze corruption-specific correlations, providing key insights to understand when synthetic corruptions succeed in representing real-world corruptions.

We propose two key modules: Efficient-KAN (Eff-KAN), which replaces MLP layers with spline functions and Wavelet-KAN (Wav-KAN), leveraging orthogonal wavelet transforms for multi-resolution feature extraction. These modules are systematically integrated in ViT encoder layers and classification heads to enhance spatial-frequency modeling while mitigating computational bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K (Image Recognition), COCO (Object Detection and Instance Segmentation), and ADE20K (Semantic Segmentation) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with Hyb-KAN ViT. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of wavelet-driven spectral priors in segmentation and spline-based efficiency in detection tasks.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense prediction often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. The ``content'' features are aligned with image crop representations to improve local discriminability, while ``context'' features learn to retain the spatial correlations under the guidance of vision foundation models, such as DINO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation.

However, annotating LiDAR point clouds is extremely costly and requires assigning semantic labels to millions of points with complex geometric structures. Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce labeling costs by querying only the most informative samples. Yet, existing AL methods face critical challenges when applied to large-scale 3D data: outdoor scenes contain an overwhelming number of points and suffer from severe class imbalance, where rare classes have far fewer points than dominant classes. To address these issues, we propose SELECT, a voxel-centric submodular approach tailored for active LiDAR semantic segmentation. Our method targets both scalability problems and class imbalance through three coordinated stages. First, we perform Voxel-Level Submodular Subset Selection, which efficiently identifies representative voxels without pairwise comparisons, ensuring scalability. Second, we estimate Voxel-Level Model Uncertainty using Monte Carlo dropout, aggregating point-wise uncertainties to identify informative voxels. Finally, we introduce Submodular Maximization for Point-Level Class Balancing, which selects a subset of points that enhances label diversity, explicitly mitigating class imbalance. Experiments on SemanticPOSS, SemanticKITTI, and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SELECT achieves superior performance compared to prior active learning approaches for 3D semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

A Benchmark To Evaluate Visual and Textual Prompts in Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06280v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering has shown remarkable success with large language models, yet its systematic exploration in computer vision remains limited. In semantic segmentation, both textual and visual prompts offer distinct advantages: textual prompts through open-vocabulary methods allow segmentation of arbitrary categories, while visual reference prompts provide intuitive reference examples. However, existing benchmarks evaluate these modalities in isolation, without direct comparison under identical conditions. We present Show or Tell (SoT), a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate both visual and textual prompts for semantic segmentation across 14 datasets spanning 7 diverse domains (common scenes, urban, food, waste, parts, tools, and land-cover). We evaluate 5 open-vocabulary methods and 4 visual reference prompt approaches, adapting the latter to handle multi-class segmentation through a confidence-based mask merging strategy. Our extensive experiments reveal that open-vocabulary methods excel with common concepts easily described by text but struggle with complex domains like tools, while visual reference prompt methods achieve good average results but exhibit high variability depending on the input prompt. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of both prompting modalities, providing valuable insights to guide future research in vision foundation models for segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PixFoundation workshop at CVPR2025.

Although camera sensors provide rich visual details, they are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions. In contrast, radar sensors remain robust under such conditions, but often produce sparse and noisy data. Therefore, a promising approach is to fuse information from both sensors. In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance camera-only baselines by integrating a diffusion model into a camera-radar fusion architecture. We leverage radar point features to create pseudo-masks using the Segment-Anything model, treating the projected radar points as point prompts. Additionally, we propose a noise reduction unit to denoise these pseudo-masks, which are further used to generate inpainted images that complete the missing information in the original images. Our method improves the camera-only segmentation baseline by 2.63% in mIoU and enhances our camera-radar fusion architecture by 1.48% in mIoU on the Waterscenes dataset. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for semantic segmentation using camera-radar fusion under adverse weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RA-L 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object grounding with simple (bare) queries, but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene graph representation with metric and semantic spatial edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to construct 3D object-centric map and an advanced raycasting algorithm with a 2D vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On the Replica and ScanNet datasets, we have demonstrated that BBQ takes a leading place in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation compared to other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On challenging Sr3D+, Nr3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling objects grounding by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The combination of our design choices and software implementation has resulted in significant data processing speed in experiments on the robot on-board computer. This promising performance enables the application of our approach in intelligent robotics projects.

However, current panoramic semantic segmentation methods fail to identify outliers, and pinhole Out-of-distribution Segmentation (OoS) models perform unsatisfactorily in the panoramic domain due to background clutter and pixel distortions. To address these issues, we introduce a new task, Panoramic Out-of-distribution Segmentation (PanOoS), achieving OoS for panoramas. Furthermore, we propose the first solution, POS, which adapts to the characteristics of panoramic images through text-guided prompt distribution learning. Specifically, POS integrates a disentanglement strategy designed to materialize the cross-domain generalization capability of CLIP. The proposed Prompt-based Restoration Attention (PRA) optimizes semantic decoding by prompt guidance and self-adaptive correction, while Bilevel Prompt Distribution Learning (BPDL) refines the manifold of per-pixel mask embeddings via semantic prototype supervision. Besides, to compensate for the scarcity of PanOoS datasets, we establish two benchmarks: DenseOoS, which features diverse outliers in complex environments, and QuadOoS, captured by a quadruped robot with a panoramic annular lens system. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of POS, with AuPRC improving by 34.25% and FPR95 decreasing by 21.42% on DenseOoS, outperforming state-of-the-art pinhole-OoS methods.

We introduce a new 3D semantic segmentation pipeline that leverages aligned scenes and state-of-the-art 2D segmentation methods, avoiding the need for direct 3D annotation or reliance on additional modalities such as camera images at inference time. Our approach generates 2D views from LiDAR scans colored by sensor intensity and applies 2D semantic segmentation to these views using a camera-domain pretrained model. The segmented 2D outputs are then back-projected onto the 3D points, with a simple voting-based estimator that merges the labels associated to each 3D point. Our main contribution is a global pipeline for 3D semantic segmentation requiring no prior 3D annotation and not other modality for inference, which can be used for pseudo-label generation. We conduct a thorough ablation study and demonstrate the potential of the generated pseudo-labels for the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation task.</p></details> | Accepted to IV2024 | None |

However, current multi-modal scene understanding approaches have naively embedded semantic representations into 3D reconstruction methods without striking a balance between visual and language modalities, which leads to unsatisfying semantic rasterization of translucent or reflective objects, as well as over-fitting on color modality. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a solution that adequately handles the distinct visual and semantic modalities, i.e., a 3D vision-language Gaussian splatting model for scene understanding, to put emphasis on the representation learning of language modality. We propose a novel cross-modal rasterizer, using modality fusion along with a smoothed semantic indicator for enhancing semantic rasterization. We also employ a camera-view blending technique to improve semantic consistency between existing and synthesized views, thereby effectively mitigating over-fitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using supervised learning strategies, have shown considerable success for such tasks. However, CNN based architectures such as U-Net, often struggles to accurately identify platelets due to their sizes and high variability of features. To address these challenges, researchers have commonly employed strategies such as class weighted loss functions, which have demonstrated some success. However, this does not address the more significant challenge of platelet variability in size and tendency to form aggregates and associations with other blood components. In this study, we explored an alternative approach by investigating the role of convolutional kernels in mitigating these issues. We also assigned separate classes to singular platelets and platelet aggregates and performed semantic segmentation using various U-Net architectures for identifying platelets. We then evaluated and compared two common methods (pixel area method and connected component analysis) for counting platelets and proposed an alternative approach specialized for single platelets and platelet aggregates. Our experiments provided results that showed significant improvements in the identification of platelets, highlighting the importance of optimizing convolutional operations and class designations. We show that the common practice of pixel area-based counting often over estimate platelet counts, whereas the proposed method presented in this work offers significant improvements. We discuss in detail about these methods from segmentation masks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, SAM is trained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for scene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low light and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes the powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash the potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T data pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original SAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong generalization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we introduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address cross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while maintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the minimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating the combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we enhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM and incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates multi-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted across three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900, and FMB.

However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15 issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies. In addition, $30$% of the classification models presented accuracy differences across the original and the optimized model variants, while $16.6$% of semantic segmentation and object detection models are also affected, at least to a limited extent.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

| **[Rethinking RGB-Event Semantic Segmentation with a Novel Bidirectional Motion-enhanced Event Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01548v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras capture motion dynamics, offering a unique modality with great potential in various computer vision tasks. However, RGB-Event fusion faces three intrinsic misalignments: (i) temporal, (ii) spatial, and (iii) modal misalignment. Existing voxel grid representations neglect temporal correlations between consecutive event windows, and their formulation with simple accumulation of asynchronous and sparse events is incompatible with the synchronous and dense nature of RGB modality. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel event representation, Motion-enhanced Event Tensor (MET), which transforms sparse event voxels into a dense and temporally coherent form by leveraging dense optical flows and event temporal features. In addition, we introduce a Frequency-aware Bidirectional Flow Aggregation Module (BFAM) and a Temporal Fusion Module (TFM). BFAM leverages the frequency domain and MET to mitigate modal misalignment, while bidirectional flow aggregation and temporal fusion mechanisms resolve spatiotemporal misalignment. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-Event semantic segmentation approaches.

However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I have decided to withdraw this paper because I have recently obtained some new data and insights during my ongoing research</p></details> | None |

While existing attention-backed segmentation methods suffer from boundary instability and contextual discontinuities during feature mapping, our framework implements a higher-dimensional geometric smoothing method to establish a robust manifold relationships between visually coherent regions. GeloVec combines modified Chebyshev distance metrics with multispatial transformations to enhance segmentation accuracy through stabilized feature extraction. The core innovation lies in the adaptive sampling weights system that calculates geometric distances in n-dimensional feature space, achieving superior edge preservation while maintaining intra-class homogeneity. The multispatial transformation matrix incorporates tensorial projections with orthogonal basis vectors, creating more discriminative feature representations without sacrificing computational efficiency. Experimental validation across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates significant improvements in segmentation performance, with mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) gains of 2.1%, 2.7%, and 2.4% on Caltech Birds-200, LSDSC, and FSSD datasets respectively compared to state-of-the-art methods. GeloVec's mathematical foundation in Riemannian geometry provides theoretical guarantees on segmentation stability. Importantly, our framework maintains computational efficiency through parallelized implementation of geodesic transformations and exhibits strong generalization capabilities across disciplines due to the absence of information loss during transformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the recently proposed Mamba architecture, have emerged as a paradigm-shifting solution, combining linear computational scaling with global context modeling. This survey presents a comprehensive review of Mamba-based methodologies in remote sensing, systematically analyzing about 120 studies to construct a holistic taxonomy of innovations and applications.

By bridging the gap between SSM theory and remote sensing practice, this survey establishes Mamba as a transformative framework for remote sensing analysis. To our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review of Mamba architectures in remote sensing.

Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation with geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without high-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain consistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have utilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view consensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that relies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's implicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry, enabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision. We propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF, initialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are corrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance disambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure globally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain highly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a balanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and semantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods and competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing them when using additional 3D point clouds.

This conclusion of Huellermeier et al. underpins the importance of calibrated uncertainties. Since AI-based algorithms are heavily impacted by dataset shifts, the automotive industry needs to safeguard its system against all possible contingencies. One important but often neglected dataset shift is caused by optical aberrations induced by the windshield. For the verification of the perception system performance, requirements on the AI performance need to be translated into optical metrics by a bijective mapping. Given this bijective mapping it is evident that the optical system characteristics add additional information about the magnitude of the dataset shift. As a consequence, we propose to incorporate a physical inductive bias into the neural network calibration architecture to enhance the robustness and the trustworthiness of the AI target application, which we demonstrate by using a semantic segmentation task as an example. By utilizing the Zernike coefficient vector of the optical system as a physical prior we can significantly reduce the mean expected calibration error in case of optical aberrations. As a result, we pave the way for a trustworthy uncertainty representation and for a holistic verification strategy of the perception chain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> | None |

However, many state-of-the-art methods are tested on outdated, lower-resolution LiDAR sensors and struggle with real-time constraints. This study introduces a novel semantic segmentation framework tailored for modern high-resolution LiDAR sensors that addresses both accuracy and real-time processing demands. We propose a novel LiDAR dataset collected by a cutting-edge automotive 128 layer LiDAR in urban traffic scenes. Furthermore, we propose a semantic segmentation method utilizing surface normals as strong input features.

| **[ClassWise-CRF: Category-Specific Fusion for Enhanced Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21491v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a result-level category-specific fusion architecture called ClassWise-CRF. This architecture employs a two-stage process: first, it selects expert networks that perform well in specific categories from a pool of candidate networks using a greedy algorithm; second, it integrates the segmentation predictions of these selected networks by adaptively weighting their contributions based on their segmentation performance in each category. Inspired by Conditional Random Field (CRF), the ClassWise-CRF architecture treats the segmentation predictions from multiple networks as confidence vector fields. It leverages segmentation metrics (such as Intersection over Union) from the validation set as priors and employs an exponential weighting strategy to fuse the category-specific confidence scores predicted by each network. This fusion method dynamically adjusts the weights of each network for different categories, achieving category-specific optimization. Building on this, the architecture further optimizes the fused results using unary and pairwise potentials in CRF to ensure spatial consistency and boundary accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of ClassWise-CRF, we conducted experiments on two remote sensing datasets, LoveDA and Vaihingen, using eight classic and advanced semantic segmentation networks. The results show that the ClassWise-CRF architecture significantly improves segmentation performance: on the LoveDA dataset, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric increased by 1.00% on the validation set and by 0.68% on the test set; on the Vaihingen dataset, the mIoU improved by 0.87% on the validation set and by 0.91% on the test set. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the ClassWise-CRF architecture in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.

Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PreCM: The Padding-based Rotation Equivariant Convolution Mode for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01624v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is an important branch of image processing and computer vision. With the popularity of deep learning, various convolutional neural networks have been proposed for pixel-level classification and segmentation tasks. In practical scenarios, however, imaging angles are often arbitrary, encompassing instances such as water body images from remote sensing and capillary and polyp images in the medical domain, where prior orientation information is typically unavailable to guide these networks to extract more effective features. In this case, learning features from objects with diverse orientation information poses a significant challenge, as the majority of CNN-based semantic segmentation networks lack rotation equivariance to resist the disturbance from orientation information. To address this challenge, this paper first constructs a universal convolution-group framework aimed at more fully utilizing orientation information and equipping the network with rotation equivariance. Subsequently, we mathematically design a padding-based rotation equivariant convolution mode (PreCM), which is not only applicable to multi-scale images and convolutional kernels but can also serve as a replacement component for various types of convolutions, such as dilated convolutions, transposed convolutions, and asymmetric convolution. To quantitatively assess the impact of image rotation in semantic segmentation tasks, we also propose a new evaluation metric, Rotation Difference (RD). The replacement experiments related to six existing semantic segmentation networks on three datasets show that, the average Intersection Over Union (IOU) of their PreCM-based versions respectively improve 6.91%, 10.63%, 4.53%, 5.93%, 7.48%, 8.33% compared to their original versions in terms of random angle rotation. And the average RD values are decreased by 3.58%, 4.56%, 3.47%, 3.66%, 3.47%, 3.43% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, submitted to TIP</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a general topological dynamics model to fold complex clothing. By utilizing the visible folding structure as the topological skeleton, we design a novel topological graph to represent the clothing state. This topological graph is low-dimensional and applied for complex clothing in various folding states. It indicates the constraints of clothing and enables predictions regarding clothing movement. To extract graphs from self-occlusion, we apply semantic segmentation to analyze the occlusion relationships and decompose the clothing structure. The decomposed structure is then combined with keypoint detection to generate the topological graph. To analyze the behavior of the topological graph, we employ an improved Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the general dynamics. The GNN model can predict the deformation of clothing and is employed to calculate the deformation Jacobi matrix for control. Experiments using jackets validate the algorithm's effectiveness to recognize and fold complex clothing with self-occlusion.</p></details> |  | None |

However, modern ConvNets remain confined to a pyramid structure that successively downsamples the feature map for receptive field expansion, neglecting this crucial biomimetic principle. We present OverLoCK, the first pure ConvNet backbone architecture that explicitly incorporates a top-down attention mechanism. Unlike pyramid backbone networks, our design features a branched architecture with three synergistic sub-networks: 1) a Base-Net that encodes low/mid-level features; 2) a lightweight Overview-Net that generates dynamic top-down attention through coarse global context modeling (i.e., overview first); and 3) a robust Focus-Net that performs finer-grained perception guided by top-down attention (i.e., look closely next). To fully unleash the power of top-down attention, we further propose a novel context-mixing dynamic convolution (ContMix) that effectively models long-range dependencies while preserving inherent local inductive biases even when the input resolution increases, addressing critical limitations in existing convolutions. Our OverLoCK exhibits a notable performance improvement over existing methods. For instance, OverLoCK-T achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 84.2%, significantly surpassing ConvNeXt-B while using only around one-third of the FLOPs/parameters. On object detection, our OverLoCK-S clearly surpasses MogaNet-B by 1% in AP^b. On semantic segmentation, our OverLoCK-T remarkably improves UniRepLKNet-T by 1.7% in mIoU.

Remote sensing surveys complement field-based approaches, and their reach can be especially great when combined with deep learning and computer vision techniques. However, conventional supervised deep learning methods face challenges in annotating fine-grained archaeological features at scale. While recent vision foundation models have shown remarkable success in learning large-scale remote sensing data with minimal annotations, most off-the-shelf solutions are designed for RGB images rather than multi-spectral satellite imagery, such as the 8-band data used in our study. In this paper, we introduce DeepAndes, a transformer-based vision foundation model trained on three million multi-spectral satellite images, specifically tailored for Andean archaeology. DeepAndes incorporates a customized DINOv2 self-supervised learning algorithm optimized for 8-band multi-spectral imagery, marking the first foundation model designed explicitly for the Andes region. We evaluate its image understanding performance through imbalanced image classification, image instance retrieval, and pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments show that DeepAndes achieves superior F1 scores, mean average precision, and Dice scores in few-shot learning scenarios, significantly outperforming models trained from scratch or pre-trained on smaller datasets. This underscores the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised pre-training in archaeological remote sensing.

The model selects real patches seen during training as prototypes and constructs the dense prediction map based on the similarity between parts of the test image and the prototypes. This improves interpretability since the user can inspect the link between the predicted output and the patterns learned by the model in terms of prototypical information. In this paper, we propose a method for interpretable semantic segmentation that leverages multi-scale image representation for prototypical part learning. First, we introduce a prototype layer that explicitly learns diverse prototypical parts at several scales, leading to multi-scale representations in the prototype activation output. Then, we propose a sparse grouping mechanism that produces multi-scale sparse groups of these scale-specific prototypical parts. This provides a deeper understanding of the interactions between multi-scale object representations while enhancing the interpretability of the segmentation model. The experiments conducted on Pascal VOC, Cityscapes, and ADE20K demonstrate that the proposed method increases model sparsity, improves interpretability over existing prototype-based methods, and narrows the performance gap with the non-interpretable counterpart models.

While previous efforts in UHR semantic segmentation have largely focused on multi-branch network architectures that emphasize multi-scale feature extraction and fusion, they have often overlooked the importance of addressing the long-tail issue. In contrast to prior UHR methods that focused on independent feature extraction, we emphasize data augmentation and multimodal feature fusion to alleviate the long-tail problem. In this paper, we introduce SRMF, a novel framework for semantic segmentation in UHR satellite imagery. Our approach addresses the long-tail class distribution by incorporating a multi-scale cropping technique alongside a data augmentation strategy based on semantic reordering and resampling. To further enhance model performance, we propose a multimodal fusion-based general representation knowledge injection method, which, for the first time, fuses text and visual features without the need for individual region text descriptions, extracting more robust features. Extensive experiments on the URUR, GID, and FBP datasets demonstrate that our method improves mIoU by 3.33\%, 0.66\%, and 0.98\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Current anomalous segmentation benchmarks predominantly focus on favorable weather conditions, resulting in untrustworthy evaluations that overlook the risks posed by diverse meteorological conditions in open-set environments, such as low illumination, dense fog, and heavy rain. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the ComsAmy, a challenging benchmark specifically designed for open-set anomaly segmentation in complex scenarios. ComsAmy encompasses a wide spectrum of adverse weather conditions, dynamic driving environments, and diverse anomaly types to comprehensively evaluate the model performance in realistic open-world scenarios. Our extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art anomalous segmentation models reveals that existing methods demonstrate significant deficiencies in such challenging scenarios, highlighting their serious safety risks for real-world deployment. To solve that, we propose a novel energy-entropy learning (EEL) strategy that integrates the complementary information from energy and entropy to bolster the robustness of anomaly segmentation under complex open-world environments. Additionally, a diffusion-based anomalous training data synthesizer is proposed to generate diverse and high-quality anomalous images to enhance the existing copy-paste training data synthesizer. Extensive experimental results on both public and ComsAmy benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed diffusion-based synthesizer with energy and entropy learning (DiffEEL) serves as an effective and generalizable plug-and-play method to enhance existing models, yielding an average improvement of around 4.96% in $\rm{AUPRC}$ and 9.87% in $\rm{FPR}_{95}$.</p></details> |  | None |

Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with only marginal performance degradation.</p></details> |  | None |

While previous work has considered distortions caused by ego motion, distortions caused by other moving objects remain largely overlooked, leading to errors in object shape and position. This distortion is particularly pronounced in high-speed environments such as highways and in multi-LiDAR configurations, a common setup for heavy vehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce HiMo, a pipeline that repurposes scene flow estimation for non-ego motion compensation, correcting the representation of dynamic objects in point clouds. During the development of HiMo, we observed that existing self-supervised scene flow estimators often produce degenerate or inconsistent estimates under high-speed distortion. We further propose SeFlow++, a real-time scene flow estimator that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scene flow and motion compensation. Since well-established motion distortion metrics are absent in the literature, we introduce two evaluation metrics: compensation accuracy at a point level and shape similarity of objects. We validate HiMo through extensive experiments on Argoverse 2, ZOD, and a newly collected real-world dataset featuring highway driving and multi-LiDAR-equipped heavy vehicles. Our findings show that HiMo improves the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of dynamic objects in LiDAR point clouds, benefiting downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation and 3D detection.

However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require numerous trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high-resolution representation CNNs efficiently by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features but also finds the proper location for placing the multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objectives (e.g., latency and mIoU) and is capable of finding architectures on the Pareto frontier with an arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of models via the Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searches for the best hybrid combination of light-weight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuses them to high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyCTAS outperforms previous methods in both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation tasks.

However, in the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic feature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets.

Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages,11 figures,5 tables</p></details> | None |

However, centralized deep learning (DL) approaches for semantic segmentation raise privacy and scalability challenges, particularly when handling sensitive data. This research presents a new federated learning (FL) framework that integrates secure deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Differential Privacy (DP) to address these issues. The core contribution of this work involves: (1) developing a new hybrid UNet-ResNet34 architecture for centralized semantic segmentation to achieve high accuracy and tackle privacy concerns due to centralized training, and (2) implementing the privacy-preserving FL model, distributed across AVs to enhance performance through secure CNNs and DP mechanisms. In the proposed FL framework, the methodology distinguishes itself from the existing approach through the following: (a) ensuring data decentralization through FL to uphold user privacy by eliminating the need for centralized data aggregation, (b) integrating DP mechanisms to secure sensitive model updates against potential adversarial inference attacks, and (c) evaluating the frameworks performance and generalizability using RGB and semantic segmentation datasets derived from the CARLA simulator. Experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy, from 81.5% to 88.7% for the RGB dataset and from 79.3% to 86.9% for the SEG dataset over 20 to 70 Communication Rounds (CRs). Global loss was reduced by over 60%, and minor accuracy trade-offs from DP were observed. This study contributes by offering a scalable, privacy-preserving FL framework tailored for AVs, optimizing communication efficiency while balancing performance and data security.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in Scientific Reports</p></details> | None |

| **[Multi-Grained Compositional Visual Clue Learning for Image Intent Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18201v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era where social media platforms abound, individuals frequently share images that offer insights into their intents and interests, impacting individual life quality and societal stability. Traditional computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation, focus on concrete visual representations, while intent recognition relies more on implicit visual clues. This poses challenges due to the wide variation and subjectivity of such clues, compounded by the problem of intra-class variety in conveying abstract concepts, e.g. "enjoy life". Existing methods seek to solve the problem by manually designing representative features or building prototypes for each class from global features. However, these methods still struggle to deal with the large visual diversity of each intent category. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach named Multi-grained Compositional visual Clue Learning (MCCL) to address these challenges for image intent recognition. Our method leverages the systematic compositionality of human cognition by breaking down intent recognition into visual clue composition and integrating multi-grained features. We adopt class-specific prototypes to alleviate data imbalance. We treat intent recognition as a multi-label classification problem, using a graph convolutional network to infuse prior knowledge through label embedding correlations. Demonstrated by a state-of-the-art performance on the Intentonomy and MDID datasets, our approach advances the accuracy of existing methods while also possessing good interpretability. Our work provides an attempt for future explorations in understanding complex and miscellaneous forms of human expression.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[What is the Added Value of UDA in the VFM Era?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18190v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) can improve a perception model's generalization to an unlabeled target domain starting from a labeled source domain. UDA using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with synthetic source data can achieve generalization performance comparable to fully-supervised learning with real target data. However, because VFMs have strong generalization from their pre-training, more straightforward, source-only fine-tuning can also perform well on the target. As data scenarios used in academic research are not necessarily representative for real-world applications, it is currently unclear (a) how UDA behaves with more representative and diverse data and (b) if source-only fine-tuning of VFMs can perform equally well in these scenarios. Our research aims to close these gaps and, similar to previous studies, we focus on semantic segmentation as a representative perception task. We assess UDA for synth-to-real and real-to-real use cases with different source and target data combinations. We also investigate the effect of using a small amount of labeled target data in UDA. We clarify that while these scenarios are more realistic, they are not necessarily more challenging. Our results show that, when using stronger synthetic source data, UDA's improvement over source-only fine-tuning of VFMs reduces from +8 mIoU to +2 mIoU, and when using more diverse real source data, UDA has no added value. However, UDA generalization is always higher in all synthetic data scenarios than source-only fine-tuning and, when including only 1/16 of Cityscapes labels, synthetic UDA obtains the same state-of-the-art segmentation quality of 85 mIoU as a fully-supervised model using all labels. Considering the mixed results, we discuss how UDA can best support robust autonomous driving at scale.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing token pruning methods often overlook fundamental visual data characteristics. This study introduces 'LVTP', a progressive token pruning framework guided by multi-scale Tsallis entropy and low-level visual features with twice clustering. It integrates high-level semantics and basic visual attributes for precise segmentation. A novel dynamic scoring mechanism using multi-scale Tsallis entropy weighting overcomes limitations of traditional single-parameter entropy. The framework also incorporates low-level feature analysis to preserve critical edge information while optimizing computational cost. As a plug-and-play module, it requires no architectural changes or additional training. Evaluations across multiple datasets show 20%-45% computational reductions with negligible performance loss, outperforming existing methods in balancing cost and accuracy, especially in complex edge regions.</p></details> |  | None |

The platform is built using a multi-modal data-enabled traffic environment constructed from drone-based aerial LiDAR, OpenStreetMap, and vehicle sensor data (e.g., GPS and inclinometer readings). High-resolution 3D road geometries are generated through AI-powered semantic segmentation and georeferencing of aerial LiDAR data. To simulate real-world driving scenarios, the platform integrates the CAR Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator, Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) traffic model, and NVIDIA PhysX vehicle dynamics engine. CARLA provides detailed micro-level sensor and perception data, while SUMO manages macro-level traffic flow. NVIDIA PhysX enables accurate modeling of vehicle behaviors under diverse conditions, accounting for mass distribution, tire friction, and center of mass. This integrated system supports high-fidelity simulations that capture the complex interactions between autonomous and conventional vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate the platform's ability to reproduce realistic vehicle dynamics and traffic scenarios, enhancing the analysis of active safety measures. Overall, the proposed framework advances traffic safety research by enabling in-depth, physics-informed evaluation of vehicle behavior in dynamic and heterogeneous traffic environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 18 figures | None |

In particular, when objects exists as small pixel-sized entities in a large context of similar objects. Deep learning approaches using supervised models with pre-trained weights, such as residual networks and vision transformers have demonstrated success for many applications. Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of learned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable performance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using self-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then applied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven to be effective to obtain representations that captures global context information. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to reconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for various applications. However, if the sizes of the objects in images are less than the size of the mask, the global context information is lost, making it almost impossible to reconstruct the image. In this study, we investigated the effect of mask ratios and patch sizes for blood components using a MAE to obtain learned ViT encoder representations. We then applied the encoder weights to train a U-Net Transformer for semantic segmentation to obtain both local and global contextual information. Our experimental results demonstrates that both smaller mask ratios and patch sizes improve the reconstruction of images using a MAE. We also show the results of semantic segmentation with and without pre-trained weights, where smaller-sized blood components benefited with pre-training. Overall, our proposed method offers an efficient and effective strategy for the segmentation and classification of small objects.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Occlusion-Aware Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation for Weak-Texture Endoscopic Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17582v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a self-supervised monocular depth estimation network tailored for endoscopic scenes, aiming to infer depth within the gastrointestinal tract from monocular images. Existing methods, though accurate, typically assume consistent illumination, which is often violated due to dynamic lighting and occlusions caused by GI motility. These variations lead to incorrect geometric interpretations and unreliable self-supervised signals, degrading depth reconstruction quality. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware self-supervised framework. First, we incorporate an occlusion mask for data augmentation, generating pseudo-labels by simulating viewpoint-dependent occlusion scenarios. This enhances the model's ability to learn robust depth features under partial visibility. Second, we leverage semantic segmentation guided by non-negative matrix factorization, clustering convolutional activations to generate pseudo-labels in texture-deprived regions, thereby improving segmentation accuracy and mitigating information loss from lighting changes. Experimental results on the SCARED dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised depth estimation. Additionally, evaluations on the Endo-SLAM and SERV-CT datasets demonstrate strong generalization across diverse endoscopic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Materials and Methods: Dafne is free software with a client-server architecture. The client side is an advanced user interface that applies the deep learning models stored on the server to the user's data and allows the user to check and refine the prediction. Incremental learning is then performed at the client's side and sent back to the server, where it is integrated into the root model. Dafne was evaluated locally, by assessing the performance gain across model generations on 38 MRI datasets of the lower legs, and through the analysis of real-world usage statistics (n = 639 use-cases). Results: Dafne demonstrated a statistically improvement in the accuracy of semantic segmentation over time (average increase of the Dice Similarity Coefficient by 0.007 points/generation on the local validation set, p < 0.001). Qualitatively, the models showed enhanced performance on various radiologic image types, including those not present in the initial training sets, indicating good model generalizability.

Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions.

Traditional RGB-D processing pipelines focus primarily on geometric reconstruction, limiting their ability to support advanced robotic perception, planning, and interaction. A key challenge is the lack of generalized methods for segmenting RGB-D data into semantically meaningful components while maintaining accurate geometric representations. We introduce a novel end-to-end modular pipeline that integrates state-of-the-art semantic segmentation, human tracking, point-cloud fusion, and scene reconstruction. Our approach improves semantic segmentation accuracy by leveraging the foundational segmentation model SAM2 with a hybrid method that combines its mask generation with a semantic classification model, resulting in sharper masks and high classification accuracy. Compared to SegFormer and OneFormer, our method achieves a similar semantic segmentation accuracy (mIoU of 47.0% vs 45.9% in the ADE20K dataset) but provides much more precise object boundaries. Additionally, our human tracking algorithm interacts with the segmentation enabling continuous tracking even when objects leave and re-enter the frame by object re-identification. Our point cloud fusion approach reduces computation time by 1.81x while maintaining a small mean reconstruction error of 25.3 mm by leveraging the semantic information. We validate our approach on benchmark datasets and real-world Kinect RGB-D data, demonstrating improved efficiency, accuracy, and usability. Our structured representation, stored in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, supports efficient querying, visualization, and robotic simulation, making it practical for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful strategy for addressing the scarcity of labeled data in these novel environments. This paper represents one of the first efforts in evaluating the feasibility of employing adapters toward efficient transfer learning for rock segmentation in extraterrestrial landscapes, mainly focusing on lunar and martian terrains. Our work suggests that the use of adapters, strategically integrated into a pre-trained backbone model, can be successful in reducing both bandwidth and memory requirements for the target extraterrestrial device. In this study, we considered two memory-saving strategies: layer fusion (to reduce to zero the inference overhead) and an ``adapter ranking'' (to also reduce the transmission cost). Finally, we evaluate these results in terms of task performance, memory, and computation on embedded devices, evidencing trade-offs that open the road to more research in the field.</p></details> |  | None |

Current deep-learning-based extraction approaches predominantly rely on semantic segmentation paradigms and post-processing algorithms, limiting their boundary precision and applicability. However, existing polygonal extraction methodologies are inherently designed for near-nadir imagery and fail under the geometric complexities introduced by off-nadir viewing angles. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Polygonal Footprint Network (PolyFootNet), a novel deep-learning framework that directly outputs polygonal building footprints without requiring external post-processing steps. PolyFootNet employs a High-Quality Mask Prompter to generate precise roof masks, which guide polygonal vertex extraction in a unified model pipeline. A key contribution of PolyFootNet is introducing the Self Offset Attention mechanism, grounded in Nadaraya-Watson regression, to effectively mitigate the accuracy discrepancy observed between low-rise and high-rise buildings. This approach allows low-rise building predictions to leverage angular corrections learned from high-rise building offsets, significantly enhancing overall extraction accuracy. Additionally, motivated by the inherent ambiguity of building footprint extraction tasks, we systematically investigate alternative extraction paradigms and demonstrate that a combined approach of building masks and offsets achieves superior polygonal footprint results. Extensive experiments validate PolyFootNet's effectiveness, illustrating its promising potential as a robust, generalizable, and precise polygonal building footprint extraction method from challenging off-nadir imagery. To facilitate further research, we will release pre-trained weights of our offset prediction module at https://github.com/likaiucas/PolyFootNet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/likaiucas/PolyFootNet) |

Prior work has focused on meta-learning for support-query matching, with extensive development in both prototype-based and aggregation-based methods. To address data scarcity, recent approaches have turned to foundation models to enhance representation transferability for novel class segmentation. Among them, a hybrid dual-modal framework including both DINOv2 and SAM has garnered attention due to their complementary capabilities. We wonder "can we build a unified model with knowledge from both foundation models?" To this end, we propose FS-DINO, with only DINOv2's encoder and a lightweight segmenter. The segmenter features a bottleneck adapter, a meta-visual prompt generator based on dense similarities and semantic embeddings, and a decoder. Through coarse-to-fine cross-model distillation, we effectively integrate SAM's knowledge into our lightweight segmenter, which can be further enhanced by 4D correlation mining on support-query pairs. Extensive experiments on COCO-20i, PASCAL-5i, and FSS-1000 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> |  | None |
